<h2>CANTO I</h2>
<br><br>
<a href="images/01-002.jpg"><img alt="01-002b.jpg (60K)" src="images/01-002b.jpg" height="544" width="360"></a>
<br><br><br><br>
<p>
In the midway of this our mortal life,<br>
I found me in a gloomy wood, astray<br>
Gone from the path direct: and e'en to tell<br>
It were no easy task, how savage wild<br>
That forest, how robust and rough its growth,<br>
Which to remember only, my dismay<br>
Renews, in bitterness not far from death.<br>
Yet to discourse of what there good befell,<br>
All else will I relate discover'd there.<br>
How first I enter'd it I scarce can say,<br>
Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh'd<br>
My senses down, when the true path I left,<br>
But when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where clos'd<br>
The valley, that had pierc'd my heart with dread,<br>
I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad<br>
Already vested with that planet's beam,<br>
Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.<br>
<br>Then was a little respite to the fear,<br>
That in my heart's recesses deep had lain,<br>
All of that night, so pitifully pass'd:<br>
And as a man, with difficult short breath,<br>
Forespent with toiling, 'scap'd from sea to shore,<br>
Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands<br>
At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd<br>
Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,<br>
That none hath pass'd and liv'd. &nbsp;My weary frame<br>
After short pause recomforted, again<br>
I journey'd on over that lonely steep,<br>
<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/01-005.jpg"><img alt="01-005b.jpg (56K)" src="images/01-005b.jpg" height="414" width="488"></a>
<br><br><br><br>
The hinder foot still firmer. &nbsp;Scarce the ascent<br>
Began, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,<br>
And cover'd with a speckled skin, appear'd,<br>
Nor, when it saw me, vanish'd, rather strove<br>
To check my onward going; that ofttimes<br>
With purpose to retrace my steps I turn'd.<br>
<br>The hour was morning's prime, and on his way<br>
Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,<br>
That with him rose, when Love divine first mov'd<br>
Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope<br>
All things conspir'd to fill me, the gay skin<br>
Of that swift animal, the matin dawn<br>
And the sweet season. &nbsp;Soon that joy was chas'd,<br>
And by new dread succeeded, when in view<br>
A lion came, 'gainst me, as it appear'd,<br>
<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/01-007.jpg"><img alt="01-007b.jpg (38K)" src="images/01-007b.jpg" height="541" width="350"></a>
<br><br><br><br>
With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,<br>
That e'en the air was fear-struck. &nbsp;A she-wolf<br>
Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem'd<br>
Full of all wants, and many a land hath made<br>
Disconsolate ere now. &nbsp;She with such fear<br>
O'erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall'd,<br>
That of the height all hope I lost. &nbsp;As one,<br>
Who with his gain elated, sees the time<br>
When all unwares is gone, he inwardly<br>
Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,<br>
Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,<br>
Who coming o'er against me, by degrees<br>
Impell'd me where the sun in silence rests.<br>
<br>While to the lower space with backward step<br>
I fell, my ken discern'd the form one of one,<br>
Whose voice seem'd faint through long disuse of speech.<br>
When him in that great desert I espied,<br>
"Have mercy on me!" &nbsp;cried I out aloud,<br>
"Spirit! or living man! what e'er thou be!"<br>
<br>He answer'd: "Now not man, man once I was,<br>
And born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both<br>
By country, when the power of Julius yet<br>
Was scarcely firm. &nbsp;At Rome my life was past<br>
Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time<br>
Of fabled deities and false. &nbsp;A bard<br>
Was I, and made Anchises' upright son<br>
The subject of my song, who came from Troy,<br>
When the flames prey'd on Ilium's haughty towers.<br>
But thou, say wherefore to such perils past<br>
Return'st thou? &nbsp;wherefore not this pleasant mount<br>
Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?"<br>
"And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,<br>
From which such copious floods of eloquence<br>
Have issued?" &nbsp;I with front abash'd replied.<br>
"Glory and light of all the tuneful train!<br>
May it avail me that I long with zeal<br>
Have sought thy volume, and with love immense<br>
Have conn'd it o'er. &nbsp;My master thou and guide!<br>
Thou he from whom alone I have deriv'd<br>
That style, which for its beauty into fame<br>
Exalts me. &nbsp;See the beast, from whom I fled.<br>
O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/01-011.jpg"><img alt="01-011b.jpg (50K)" src="images/01-011b.jpg" height="535" width="353"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"For every vein and pulse throughout my frame<br>
She hath made tremble." &nbsp;He, soon as he saw<br>
That I was weeping, answer'd, "Thou must needs<br>
Another way pursue, if thou wouldst 'scape<br>
From out that savage wilderness. &nbsp;This beast,<br>
At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none<br>
To pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:<br>
So bad and so accursed in her kind,<br>
That never sated is her ravenous will,<br>
Still after food more craving than before.<br>
To many an animal in wedlock vile<br>
She fastens, and shall yet to many more,<br>
Until that greyhound come, who shall destroy<br>
Her with sharp pain. &nbsp;He will not life support<br>
By earth nor its base metals, but by love,<br>
Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be<br>
The land 'twixt either Feltro. &nbsp;In his might<br>
Shall safety to Italia's plains arise,<br>
For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,<br>
Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.<br>
He with incessant chase through every town<br>
Shall worry, until he to hell at length<br>
Restore her, thence by envy first let loose.<br>
I for thy profit pond'ring now devise,<br>
That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide<br>
Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,<br>
Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see<br>
Spirits of old tormented, who invoke<br>
A second death; and those next view, who dwell<br>
Content in fire, for that they hope to come,<br>
Whene'er the time may be, among the blest,<br>
Into whose regions if thou then desire<br>
T' ascend, a spirit worthier then I<br>
Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,<br>
Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,<br>
Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,<br>
Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,<br>
That to his city none through me should come.<br>
He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds<br>
His citadel and throne. &nbsp;O happy those,<br>
Whom there he chooses!" I to him in few:<br>
"Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,<br>
I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse<br>
I may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,<br>
That I Saint Peter's gate may view, and those<br>
Who as thou tell'st, are in such dismal plight."<br>
<br>Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<h2>CANTO II</h2>

<a href="images/02-017.jpg"><img alt="02-017b.jpg (36K)" src="images/02-017b.jpg" height="525" width="347"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>NOW was the day departing, and the air,<br>
Imbrown'd with shadows, from their toils releas'd<br>
All animals on earth; and I alone<br>
Prepar'd myself the conflict to sustain,<br>
Both of sad pity, and that perilous road,<br>
Which my unerring memory shall retrace.<br>
<br>O Muses! O high genius! now vouchsafe<br>
Your aid! O mind! that all I saw hast kept<br>
Safe in a written record, here thy worth<br>
And eminent endowments come to proof.<br>
<br>I thus began: "Bard! thou who art my guide,<br>
Consider well, if virtue be in me<br>
Sufficient, ere to this high enterprise<br>
Thou trust me. &nbsp;Thou hast told that Silvius' sire,<br>
Yet cloth'd in corruptible flesh, among<br>
Th' immortal tribes had entrance, and was there<br>
Sensible present. &nbsp;Yet if heaven's great Lord,<br>
Almighty foe to ill, such favour shew'd,<br>
In contemplation of the high effect,<br>
Both what and who from him should issue forth,<br>
It seems in reason's judgment well deserv'd:<br>
Sith he of Rome, and of Rome's empire wide,<br>
In heaven's empyreal height was chosen sire:<br>
Both which, if truth be spoken, were ordain'd<br>
And 'stablish'd for the holy place, where sits<br>
Who to great Peter's sacred chair succeeds.<br>
He from this journey, in thy song renown'd,<br>
Learn'd things, that to his victory gave rise<br>
And to the papal robe. &nbsp;In after-times<br>
The chosen vessel also travel'd there,<br>
To bring us back assurance in that faith,<br>
Which is the entrance to salvation's way.<br>
But I, why should I there presume? &nbsp;or who<br>
Permits it? &nbsp;not, Aeneas I nor Paul.<br>
Myself I deem not worthy, and none else<br>
Will deem me. &nbsp;I, if on this voyage then<br>
I venture, fear it will in folly end.<br>
Thou, who art wise, better my meaning know'st,<br>
Than I can speak." &nbsp;As one, who unresolves<br>
What he hath late resolv'd, and with new thoughts<br>
Changes his purpose, from his first intent<br>
Remov'd; e'en such was I on that dun coast,<br>
Wasting in thought my enterprise, at first<br>
So eagerly embrac'd. &nbsp;"If right thy words<br>
I scan," replied that shade magnanimous,<br>
"Thy soul is by vile fear assail'd, which oft<br>
So overcasts a man, that he recoils<br>
From noblest resolution, like a beast<br>
At some false semblance in the twilight gloom.<br>
That from this terror thou mayst free thyself,<br>
I will instruct thee why I came, and what<br>
I heard in that same instant, when for thee<br>
Grief touch'd me first. &nbsp;I was among the tribe,<br>
Who rest suspended, when a dame, so blest<br>
And lovely, I besought her to command,<br>
Call'd me; her eyes were brighter than the star<br>
Of day; and she with gentle voice and soft<br>
Angelically tun'd her speech address'd:<br>
"O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame<br>
Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!<br>
A friend, not of my fortune but myself,<br>
On the wide desert in his road has met<br>
Hindrance so great, that he through fear has turn'd.<br>
Now much I dread lest he past help have stray'd,<br>
And I be ris'n too late for his relief,<br>
From what in heaven of him I heard. &nbsp;Speed now,<br>
And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,<br>
And by all means for his deliverance meet,<br>
Assist him. &nbsp;So to me will comfort spring.<br>
I who now bid thee on this errand forth<br>
Am Beatrice; from a place I come.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/02-021.jpg"><img alt="02-021b.jpg (45K)" src="images/02-021b.jpg" height="537" width="352"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>(Note: Beatrice. &nbsp;I use this word, as it is<br>
pronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four<br>
syllables, of which the third is a long one.)</p>

<p>Revisited with joy. &nbsp;Love brought me thence,<br>
Who prompts my speech. &nbsp;When in my Master's sight<br>
I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell."<br>
<br>She then was silent, and I thus began:<br>
"O Lady! by whose influence alone,<br>
Mankind excels whatever is contain'd<br>
Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb,<br>
So thy command delights me, that to obey,<br>
If it were done already, would seem late.<br>
No need hast thou farther to speak thy will;<br>
Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth<br>
To leave that ample space, where to return<br>
Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath."<br>
<br>She then: "Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,<br>
I will instruct thee briefly, why no dread<br>
Hinders my entrance here. &nbsp;Those things alone<br>
Are to be fear'd, whence evil may proceed,<br>
None else, for none are terrible beside.<br>
I am so fram'd by God, thanks to his grace!<br>
That any suff'rance of your misery<br>
Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire<br>
Assails me. &nbsp;In high heaven a blessed dame<br>
Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief<br>
That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,<br>
That God's stern judgment to her will inclines."<br>
To Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:<br>
"Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid<br>
And I commend him to thee." &nbsp;At her word<br>
Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,<br>
And coming to the place, where I abode<br>
Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days,<br>
She thus address'd me: "Thou true praise of God!<br>
Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent<br>
To him, who so much lov'd thee, as to leave<br>
For thy sake all the multitude admires?<br>
Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,<br>
Nor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,<br>
Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?"<br>
Ne'er among men did any with such speed<br>
Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy,<br>
As when these words were spoken, I came here,<br>
Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force<br>
Of thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all<br>
Who well have mark'd it, into honour brings."<br>
<br>"When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes<br>
Tearful she turn'd aside; whereat I felt<br>
Redoubled zeal to serve thee. &nbsp;As she will'd,<br>
Thus am I come: I sav'd thee from the beast,<br>
Who thy near way across the goodly mount<br>
Prevented. &nbsp;What is this comes o'er thee then?<br>
Why, why dost thou hang back? &nbsp;why in thy breast<br>
Harbour vile fear? &nbsp;why hast not courage there<br>
And noble daring? &nbsp;Since three maids so blest<br>
Thy safety plan, e'en in the court of heaven;<br>
And so much certain good my words forebode."<br>
<br>As florets, by the frosty air of night<br>
Bent down and clos'd, when day has blanch'd their leaves,<br>
Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems;<br>
So was my fainting vigour new restor'd,<br>
And to my heart such kindly courage ran,<br>
That I as one undaunted soon replied:<br>
"O full of pity she, who undertook<br>
My succour! and thou kind who didst perform<br>
So soon her true behest!  With such desire<br>
Thou hast dispos'd me to renew my voyage,<br>
That my first purpose fully is resum'd.<br>
Lead on: one only will is in us both.<br>
Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord."<br>
<br>So spake I; and when he had onward mov'd,<br>
I enter'd on the deep and woody way.</p>
