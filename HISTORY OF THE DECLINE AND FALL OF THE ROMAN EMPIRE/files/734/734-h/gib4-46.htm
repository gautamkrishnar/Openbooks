<p>
The conflict of Rome and Persia was prolonged from the death of Craesus
to the reign of Heraclius. An experience of seven hundred years might
convince the rival nations of the impossibility of maintaining their
conquests beyond the fatal limits of the Tigris and Euphrates. Yet
the emulation of Trajan and Julian was awakened by the trophies of
Alexander, and the sovereigns of Persia indulged the ambitious hope of
restoring the empire of Cyrus. <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> Such extraordinary efforts of power
and courage will always command the attention of posterity; but the
events by which the fate of nations is not materially changed, leave a
faint impression on the page of history, and the patience of the reader
would be exhausted by the repetition of the same hostilities, undertaken
without cause, prosecuted without glory, and terminated without effect.
The arts of negotiation, unknown to the simple greatness of the senate
and the Caesars, were assiduously cultivated by the Byzantine princes;
and the memorials of their perpetual embassies <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> repeat, with the
same uniform prolixity, the language of falsehood and declamation, the
insolence of the Barbarians, and the servile temper of the tributary
Greeks. Lamenting the barren superfluity of materials, I have studied to
compress the narrative of these uninteresting transactions: but the just
Nushirvan is still applauded as the model of Oriental kings, and the
ambition of his grandson Chosroes prepared the revolution of the East,
which was speedily accomplished by the arms and the religion of the
successors of Mahomet.

In the useless altercations, that precede and justify the quarrels of
princes, the Greeks and the Barbarians accused each other of violating
the peace which had been concluded between the two empires about four
years before the death of Justinian. The sovereign of Persia and India
aspired to reduce under his obedience the province of Yemen or Arabia
<a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> Felix; the distant land of myrrh and frankincense, which had
escaped, rather than opposed, the conquerors of the East. After the
defeat of Abrahah under the walls of Mecca, the discord of his sons
and brothers gave an easy entrance to the Persians: they chased the
strangers of Abyssinia beyond the Red Sea; and a native prince of the
ancient Homerites was restored to the throne as the vassal or viceroy
of the great Nushirvan. <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> But the nephew of Justinian declared his
resolution to avenge the injuries of his Christian ally the prince of
Abyssinia, as they suggested a decent pretence to discontinue the annual
tribute, which was poorly disguised by the name of pension. The churches
of Persarmenia were oppressed by the intolerant spirit of the Magi;
<a href="#note-411" name="noteref-411"><small>411</small></a> they secretly invoked the protector of the Christians, and, after
the pious murder of their satraps, the rebels were avowed and supported
as the brethren and subjects of the Roman emperor. The complaints of
Nushirvan were disregarded by the Byzantine court; Justin yielded to the
importunities of the Turks, who offered an alliance against the common
enemy; and the Persian monarchy was threatened at the same instant by
the united forces of Europe, of Aethiopia, and of Scythia. At the age
of fourscore the sovereign of the East would perhaps have chosen the
peaceful enjoyment of his glory and greatness; but as soon as war became
inevitable, he took the field with the alacrity of youth, whilst the
aggressor trembled in the palace of Constantinople. Nushirvan, or
Chosroes, conducted in person the siege of Dara; and although that
important fortress had been left destitute of troops and magazines, the
valor of the inhabitants resisted above five months the archers, the
elephants, and the military engines of the Great King. In the mean while
his general Adarman advanced from Babylon, traversed the desert, passed
the Euphrates, insulted the suburbs of Antioch, reduced to ashes the
city of Apamea, and laid the spoils of Syria at the feet of his master,
whose perseverance in the midst of winter at length subverted the
bulwark of the East. But these losses, which astonished the provinces
and the court, produced a salutary effect in the repentance and
abdication of the emperor Justin: a new spirit arose in the Byzantine
councils; and a truce of three years was obtained by the prudence of
Tiberius. That seasonable interval was employed in the preparations
of war; and the voice of rumor proclaimed to the world, that from the
distant countries of the Alps and the Rhine, from Scythia, Maesia,
Pannonia, Illyricum, and Isauria, the strength of the Imperial cavalry
was reenforced with one hundred and fifty thousand soldiers. Yet the
king of Persia, without fear, or without faith, resolved to prevent
the attack of the enemy; again passed the Euphrates, and dismissing the
ambassadors of Tiberius, arrogantly commanded them to await his arrival
at Caesarea, the metropolis of the Cappadocian provinces. The two armies
encountered each other in the battle of Melitene: <a href="#note-412" name="noteref-412"><small>412</small></a> the Barbarians,
who darkened the air with a cloud of arrows, prolonged their line, and
extended their wings across the plain; while the Romans, in deep and
solid bodies, expected to prevail in closer action, by the weight of
their swords and lances. A Scythian chief, who commanded their right
wing, suddenly turned the flank of the enemy, attacked their rear-guard
in the presence of Chosroes, penetrated to the midst of the camp,
pillaged the royal tent, profaned the eternal fire, loaded a train of
camels with the spoils of Asia, cut his way through the Persian host,
and returned with songs of victory to his friends, who had consumed the
day in single combats, or ineffectual skirmishes. The darkness of the
night, and the separation of the Romans, afforded the Persian monarch an
opportunity of revenge; and one of their camps was swept away by a rapid
and impetuous assault. But the review of his loss, and the consciousness
of his danger, determined Chosroes to a speedy retreat: he burnt, in his
passage, the vacant town of Melitene; and, without consulting the safety
of his troops, boldly swam the Euphrates on the back of an elephant.
After this unsuccessful campaign, the want of magazines, and perhaps
some inroad of the Turks, obliged him to disband or divide his forces;
the Romans were left masters of the field, and their general Justinian,
advancing to the relief of the Persarmenian rebels, erected his standard
on the banks of the Araxes. The great Pompey had formerly halted within
three days' march of the Caspian: <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> that inland sea was explored, for
the first time, by a hostile fleet, <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> and seventy thousand captives
were transplanted from Hyrcania to the Isle of Cyprus. On the return
of spring, Justinian descended into the fertile plains of Assyria;
the flames of war approached the residence of Nushirvan; the indignant
monarch sunk into the grave; and his last edict restrained his
successors from exposing their person in battle against the Romans.
<a href="#note-611" name="noteref-611"><small>611</small></a> Yet the memory of this transient affront was lost in the glories
of a long reign; and his formidable enemies, after indulging their dream
of conquest, again solicited a short respite from the calamities of war.

[ The general independence of the Arabs, which cannot be
admitted without many limitations, is blindly asserted in a separate
dissertation of the authors of the Universal History, vol. xx. p.
196&mdash;250. A perpetual miracle is supposed to have guarded the prophecy
in favor of the posterity of Ishmael; and these learned bigots are not
afraid to risk the truth of Christianity on this frail and slippery
foundation. * Note: It certainly appears difficult to extract a
prediction of the perpetual independence of the Arabs from the text in
Genesis, which would have received an ample fulfilment during
centuries of uninvaded freedom. But the disputants appear to forget the
inseparable connection in the prediction between the wild, the Bedoween
habits of the Ismaelites, with their national independence. The
stationary and civilized descendant of Ismael forfeited, as it were, his
birthright, and ceased to be a genuine son of the "wild man" The
phrase, "dwelling in the presence of his brethren," is interpreted by
Rosenmuller (in loc.) and others, according to the Hebrew geography, "to
the East" of his brethren, the legitimate race of Abraham&mdash;M.]

proved that, after ten years' peace, the Persian war, which continued
twenty years, was renewed A.D. 571. Mahomet was born A.D. 569, in
the year of the elephant, or the defeat of Abrahah, (Gagnier, Vie de
Mahomet, tom. i. p. 89, 90, 98;) and this account allows two years for
the conquest of Yemen. * Note: Abrahah, according to some accounts, was
succeeded by his son Taksoum, who reigned seventeen years; his brother
Mascouh, who was slain in battle against the Persians, twelve. But this
chronology is irreconcilable with the Arabian conquests of Nushirvan the
Great. Either Seif, or his son Maadi Karb, was the native prince placed
on the throne by the Persians. St. Martin, vol. x. p. 78. See likewise

[ Persarmenia was long maintained in peace by the tolerant
administration of Mejej, prince of the Gnounians. On his death he was
succeeded by a persecutor, a Persian, named Ten-Schahpour, who attempted
to propagate Zoroastrianism by violence. Nushirvan, on an appeal to
the throne by the Armenian clergy, replaced Ten-Schahpour, in 552, by
Veschnas-Vahram. The new marzban, or governor, was instructed to repress
the bigoted Magi in their persecutions of the Armenians, but the Persian
converts to Christianity were still exposed to cruel sufferings. The
most distinguished of them, Izdbouzid, was crucified at Dovin in the
presence of a vast multitude. The fame of this martyr spread to the
West. Menander, the historian, not only, as appears by a fragment
published by Mai, related this event in his history, but, according
to M. St. Martin, wrote a tragedy on the subject. This, however, is
an unwarrantable inference from the phrase which merely means that he
related the tragic event in his history. An epigram on the same subject,
preserved in the Anthology, Jacob's Anth. Palat. i. 27, belongs to
the historian. Yet Armenia remained in peace under the government of
Veschnas-Vahram and his successor Varazdat. The tyranny of his successor
Surena led to the insurrection under Vartan, the Mamigonian, who
revenged the death of his brother on the marzban Surena, surprised
Dovin, and put to the sword the governor, the soldiers, and the Magians.

<p>
The throne of Chosroes Nushirvan was filled by Hormouz, or Hormisdas,
the eldest or the most favored of his sons. With the kingdoms of Persia
and India, he inherited the reputation and example of his father, the
service, in every rank, of his wise and valiant officers, and a general
system of administration, harmonized by time and political wisdom to
promote the happiness of the prince and people. But the royal youth
enjoyed a still more valuable blessing, the friendship of a sage who had
presided over his education, and who always preferred the honor to the
interest of his pupil, his interest to his inclination. In a dispute
with the Greek and Indian philosophers, Buzurg <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> had once maintained,
that the most grievous misfortune of life is old age without the
remembrance of virtue; and our candor will presume that the same
principle compelled him, during three years, to direct the councils of
the Persian empire. His zeal was rewarded by the gratitude and docility
of Hormouz, who acknowledged himself more indebted to his preceptor than
to his parent: but when age and labor had impaired the strength, and
perhaps the faculties, of this prudent counsellor, he retired from
court, and abandoned the youthful monarch to his own passions and those
of his favorites. By the fatal vicissitude of human affairs, the same
scenes were renewed at Ctesiphon, which had been exhibited at Rome after
the death of Marcus Antoninus. The ministers of flattery and corruption,
who had been banished by his father, were recalled and cherished by
the son; the disgrace and exile of the friends of Nushirvan established
their tyranny; and virtue was driven by degrees from the mind of
Hormouz, from his palace, and from the government of the state. The
faithful agents, the eyes and ears of the king, informed him of the
progress of disorder, that the provincial governors flew to their prey
with the fierceness of lions and eagles, and that their rapine and
injustice would teach the most loyal of his subjects to abhor the name
and authority of their sovereign. The sincerity of this advice was
punished with death; the murmurs of the cities were despised, their
tumults were quelled by military execution: the intermediate powers
between the throne and the people were abolished; and the childish
vanity of Hormouz, who affected the daily use of the tiara, was fond of
declaring, that he alone would be the judge as well as the master of his
kingdom.
</p>
<p>
In every word, and in every action, the son of Nushirvan degenerated
from the virtues of his father. His avarice defrauded the troops; his
jealous caprice degraded the satraps; the palace, the tribunals, the
waters of the Tigris, were stained with the blood of the innocent, and
the tyrant exulted in the sufferings and execution of thirteen thousand
victims. As the excuse of his cruelty, he sometimes condescended to
observe, that the fears of the Persians would be productive of hatred,
and that their hatred must terminate in rebellion but he forgot that his
own guilt and folly had inspired the sentiments which he deplored, and
prepared the event which he so justly apprehended. Exasperated by long
and hopeless oppression, the provinces of Babylon, Susa, and Carmania,
erected the standard of revolt; and the princes of Arabia, India, and
Scythia, refused the customary tribute to the unworthy successor of
Nushirvan. The arms of the Romans, in slow sieges and frequent inroads,
afflicted the frontiers of Mesopotamia and Assyria: one of their
generals professed himself the disciple of Scipio; and the soldiers were
animated by a miraculous image of Christ, whose mild aspect should never
have been displayed in the front of battle. <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> At the same time, the
eastern provinces of Persia were invaded by the great khan, who passed
the Oxus at the head of three or four hundred thousand Turks. The
imprudent Hormouz accepted their perfidious and formidable aid; the
cities of Khorassan or Bactriana were commanded to open their gates the
march of the Barbarians towards the mountains of Hyrcania revealed the
correspondence of the Turkish and Roman arms; and their union must have
subverted the throne of the house of Sassan.

station, as the Seneca of the East; but his virtues, and perhaps his
faults, are less known than those of the Roman, who appears to have been
much more loquacious. The Persian sage was the person who imported from
India the game of chess and the fables of Pilpay. Such has been the fame
of his wisdom and virtues, that the Christians claim him as a believer
in the gospel; and the Mahometans revere Buzurg as a premature
Mussulman. D'Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 218.]

mistaken, is the oldest of divine manufacture; but in the next thousand

</p>
<p>
Persia had been lost by a king; it was saved by a hero. After his
revolt, Varanes or Bahram is stigmatized by the son of Hormouz as an
ungrateful slave; the proud and ambiguous reproach of despotism, since
he was truly descended from the ancient princes of Rei, <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> one of
the seven families whose splendid, as well as substantial, prerogatives
exalted them above the heads of the Persian nobility. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> At the siege
of Dara, the valor of Bahram was signalized under the eyes of Nushirvan,
and both the father and son successively promoted him to the command of
armies, the government of Media, and the superintendence of the palace.
The popular prediction which marked him as the deliverer of Persia,
might be inspired by his past victories and extraordinary figure: the
epithet Giubin <a href="#note-1111" name="noteref-1111"><small>1111</small></a> is expressive of the quality of dry wood: he had
the strength and stature of a giant; and his savage countenance was
fancifully compared to that of a wild cat. While the nation trembled,
while Hormouz disguised his terror by the name of suspicion, and his
servants concealed their disloyalty under the mask of fear, Bahram alone
displayed his undaunted courage and apparent fidelity: and as soon as
he found that no more than twelve thousand soldiers would follow him
against the enemy; he prudently declared, that to this fatal number
Heaven had reserved the honors of the triumph. <a href="#note-1112" name="noteref-1112"><small>1112</small></a> The steep and
narrow descent of the Pule Rudbar, <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> or Hyrcanian rock, is the only
pass through which an army can penetrate into the territory of Rei and
the plains of Media. From the commanding heights, a band of resolute men
might overwhelm with stones and darts the myriads of the Turkish
host: their emperor and his son were transpierced with arrows; and the
fugitives were left, without counsel or provisions, to the revenge of an
injured people. The patriotism of the Persian general was stimulated by
his affection for the city of his forefathers: in the hour of victory,
every peasant became a soldier, and every soldier a hero; and their
ardor was kindled by the gorgeous spectacle of beds, and thrones, and
tables of massy gold, the spoils of Asia, and the luxury of the hostile
camp. A prince of a less malignant temper could not easily have forgiven
his benefactor; and the secret hatred of Hormouz was envenomed by a
malicious report, that Bahram had privately retained the most precious
fruits of his Turkish victory. But the approach of a Roman army on
the side of the Araxes compelled the implacable tyrant to smile and to
applaud; and the toils of Bahram were rewarded with the permission of
encountering a new enemy, by their skill and discipline more formidable
than a Scythian multitude. Elated by his recent success, he despatched
a herald with a bold defiance to the camp of the Romans, requesting them
to fix a day of battle, and to choose whether they would pass the river
themselves, or allow a free passage to the arms of the great king. The
lieutenant of the emperor Maurice preferred the safer alternative; and
this local circumstance, which would have enhanced the victory of
the Persians, rendered their defeat more bloody and their escape more
difficult. But the loss of his subjects, and the danger of his kingdom,
were overbalanced in the mind of Hormouz by the disgrace of his personal
enemy; and no sooner had Bahram collected and reviewed his forces, than
he received from a royal messenger the insulting gift of a distaff, a
spinning-wheel, and a complete suit of female apparel. Obedient to the
will of his sovereign he showed himself to the soldiers in this unworthy
disguise they resented his ignominy and their own; a shout of rebellion
ran through the ranks; and the general accepted their oath of fidelity
and vows of revenge. A second messenger, who had been commanded to bring
the rebel in chains, was trampled under the feet of an elephant, and
manifestos were diligently circulated, exhorting the Persians to assert
their freedom against an odious and contemptible tyrant. The defection
was rapid and universal; his loyal slaves were sacrificed to the public
fury; the troops deserted to the standard of Bahram; and the provinces
again saluted the deliverer of his country.

</p>
<p>
As the passes were faithfully guarded, Hormouz could only compute the
number of his enemies by the testimony of a guilty conscience, and the
daily defection of those who, in the hour of his distress, avenged their
wrongs, or forgot their obligations. He proudly displayed the ensigns of
royalty; but the city and palace of Modain had already escaped from
the hand of the tyrant. Among the victims of his cruelty, Bindoes, a
Sassanian prince, had been cast into a dungeon; his fetters were broken
by the zeal and courage of a brother; and he stood before the king at
the head of those trusty guards, who had been chosen as the ministers
of his confinement, and perhaps of his death. Alarmed by the hasty
intrusion and bold reproaches of the captive, Hormouz looked round,
but in vain, for advice or assistance; discovered that his strength
consisted in the obedience of others; and patiently yielded to the
single arm of Bindoes, who dragged him from the throne to the same
dungeon in which he himself had been so lately confined. At the first
tumult, Chosroes, the eldest of the sons of Hormouz, escaped from the
city; he was persuaded to return by the pressing and friendly invitation
of Bindoes, who promised to seat him on his father's throne, and who
expected to reign under the name of an inexperienced youth. In the just
assurance, that his accomplices could neither forgive nor hope to be
forgiven, and that every Persian might be trusted as the judge and enemy
of the tyrant, he instituted a public trial without a precedent and
without a copy in the annals of the East. The son of Nushirvan, who had
requested to plead in his own defence, was introduced as a criminal
into the full assembly of the nobles and satraps. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> He was heard with
decent attention as long as he expatiated on the advantages of order and
obedience, the danger of innovation, and the inevitable discord of those
who had encouraged each other to trample on their lawful and hereditary
sovereign. By a pathetic appeal to their humanity, he extorted that pity
which is seldom refused to the fallen fortunes of a king; and while they
beheld the abject posture and squalid appearance of the prisoner,
his tears, his chains, and the marks of ignominious stripes, it was
impossible to forget how recently they had adored the divine splendor of
his diadem and purple. But an angry murmur arose in the assembly as soon
as he presumed to vindicate his conduct, and to applaud the victories
of his reign. He defined the duties of a king, and the Persian nobles
listened with a smile of contempt; they were fired with indignation
when he dared to vilify the character of Chosroes; and by the indiscreet
offer of resigning the sceptre to the second of his sons, he subscribed
his own condemnation, and sacrificed the life of his own innocent
favorite. The mangled bodies of the boy and his mother were exposed to
the people; the eyes of Hormouz were pierced with a hot needle; and the
punishment of the father was succeeded by the coronation of his eldest
son. Chosroes had ascended the throne without guilt, and his piety
strove to alleviate the misery of the abdicated monarch; from the
dungeon he removed Hormouz to an apartment of the palace, supplied with
liberality the consolations of sensual enjoyment, and patiently endured
the furious sallies of his resentment and despair. He might despise the
resentment of a blind and unpopular tyrant, but the tiara was trembling
on his head, till he could subvert the power, or acquire the friendship,
of the great Bahram, who sternly denied the justice of a revolution, in
which himself and his soldiers, the true representatives of Persia, had
never been consulted. The offer of a general amnesty, and of the second
rank in his kingdom, was answered by an epistle from Bahram, friend of
the gods, conqueror of men, and enemy of tyrants, the satrap of satraps,
general of the Persian armies, and a prince adorned with the title of
eleven virtues. <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> He commands Chosroes, the son of Hormouz, to shun
the example and fate of his father, to confine the traitors who had been
released from their chains, to deposit in some holy place the diadem
which he had usurped, and to accept from his gracious benefactor the
pardon of his faults and the government of a province. The rebel might
not be proud, and the king most assuredly was not humble; but the one
was conscious of his strength, the other was sensible of his weakness;
and even the modest language of his reply still left room for treaty and
reconciliation. Chosroes led into the field the slaves of the palace and
the populace of the capital: they beheld with terror the banners of a
veteran army; they were encompassed and surprised by the evolutions
of the general; and the satraps who had deposed Hormouz, received the
punishment of their revolt, or expiated their first treason by a second
and more criminal act of disloyalty. The life and liberty of Chosroes
were saved, but he was reduced to the necessity of imploring aid or
refuge in some foreign land; and the implacable Bindoes, anxious to
secure an unquestionable title, hastily returned to the palace, and
ended, with a bowstring, the wretched existence of the son of Nushirvan.

<p>
While Chosroes despatched the preparations of his retreat, he
deliberated with his remaining friends, <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> whether he should lurk
in the valleys of Mount Caucasus, or fly to the tents of the Turks,
or solicit the protection of the emperor. The long emulation of the
successors of Artaxerxes and Constantine increased his reluctance to
appear as a suppliant in a rival court; but he weighed the forces of the
Romans, and prudently considered that the neighborhood of Syria would
render his escape more easy and their succors more effectual. Attended
only by his concubines, and a troop of thirty guards, he secretly
departed from the capital, followed the banks of the Euphrates,
traversed the desert, and halted at the distance of ten miles from
Circesium. About the third watch of the night, the Roman praefect was
informed of his approach, and he introduced the royal stranger to
the fortress at the dawn of day. From thence the king of Persia was
conducted to the more honorable residence of Hierapolis; and Maurice
dissembled his pride, and displayed his benevolence, at the reception
of the letters and ambassadors of the grandson of Nushirvan. They humbly
represented the vicissitudes of fortune and the common interest of
princes, exaggerated the ingratitude of Bahram, the agent of the evil
principle, and urged, with specious argument, that it was for the
advantage of the Romans themselves to support the two monarchies which
balance the world, the two great luminaries by whose salutary influence
it is vivified and adorned. The anxiety of Chosroes was soon relieved
by the assurance, that the emperor had espoused the cause of justice
and royalty; but Maurice prudently declined the expense and delay of his
useless visit to Constantinople. In the name of his generous benefactor,
a rich diadem was presented to the fugitive prince, with an inestimable
gift of jewels and gold; a powerful army was assembled on the frontiers
of Syria and Armenia, under the command of the valiant and faithful
Narses, <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> and this general, of his own nation, and his own choice,
was directed to pass the Tigris, and never to sheathe his sword till
he had restored Chosroes to the throne of his ancestors. <a href="#note-1711" name="noteref-1711"><small>1711</small></a> The
enterprise, however splendid, was less arduous than it might appear.
Persia had already repented of her fatal rashness, which betrayed the
heir of the house of Sassan to the ambition of a rebellious subject:
and the bold refusal of the Magi to consecrate his usurpation, compelled
Bahram to assume the sceptre, regardless of the laws and prejudices of
the nation. The palace was soon distracted with conspiracy, the city
with tumult, the provinces with insurrection; and the cruel execution of
the guilty and the suspected served to irritate rather than subdue the
public discontent. No sooner did the grandson of Nushirvan display his
own and the Roman banners beyond the Tigris, than he was joined, each
day, by the increasing multitudes of the nobility and people; and as he
advanced, he received from every side the grateful offerings of the keys
of his cities and the heads of his enemies. As soon as Modain was freed
from the presence of the usurper, the loyal inhabitants obeyed the first
summons of Mebodes at the head of only two thousand horse, and Chosroes
accepted the sacred and precious ornaments of the palace as the pledge
of their truth and the presage of his approaching success. After the
junction of the Imperial troops, which Bahram vainly struggled to
prevent, the contest was decided by two battles on the banks of the Zab,
and the confines of Media. The Romans, with the faithful subjects of
Persia, amounted to sixty thousand, while the whole force of the usurper
did not exceed forty thousand men: the two generals signalized their
valor and ability; but the victory was finally determined by the
prevalence of numbers and discipline. With the remnant of a broken army,
Bahram fled towards the eastern provinces of the Oxus: the enmity of
Persia reconciled him to the Turks; but his days were shortened by
poison, perhaps the most incurable of poisons; the stings of remorse
and despair, and the bitter remembrance of lost glory. Yet the modern
Persians still commemorate the exploits of Bahram; and some excellent
laws have prolonged the duration of his troubled and transitory reign.

The restoration of Chosroes was celebrated with feasts and executions;
and the music of the royal banquet was often disturbed by the groans
of dying or mutilated criminals. A general pardon might have diffused
comfort and tranquillity through a country which had been shaken by
the late revolutions; yet, before the sanguinary temper of Chosroes is
blamed, we should learn whether the Persians had not been accustomed
either to dread the rigor, or to despise the weakness, of their
sovereign. The revolt of Bahram, and the conspiracy of the satraps, were
impartially punished by the revenge or justice of the conqueror; the
merits of Bindoes himself could not purify his hand from the guilt
of royal blood: and the son of Hormouz was desirous to assert his own
innocence, and to vindicate the sanctity of kings. During the vigor of
the Roman power, several princes were seated on the throne of Persia by
the arms and the authority of the first Caesars. But their new subjects
were soon disgusted with the vices or virtues which they had imbibed in
a foreign land; the instability of their dominion gave birth to a vulgar
observation, that the choice of Rome was solicited and rejected with
equal ardor by the capricious levity of Oriental slaves. But the glory
of Maurice was conspicuous in the long and fortunate reign of his son
and his ally. A band of a thousand Romans, who continued to guard the
person of Chosroes, proclaimed his confidence in the fidelity of the
strangers; his growing strength enabled him to dismiss this unpopular
aid, but he steadily professed the same gratitude and reverence to his
adopted father; and till the death of Maurice, the peace and alliance
of the two empires were faithfully maintained. <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> Yet the mercenary
friendship of the Roman prince had been purchased with costly and
important gifts; the strong cities of Martyropolis and Dara <a href="#note-1811" name="noteref-1811"><small>1811</small></a>
were restored, and the Persarmenians became the willing subjects of an
empire, whose eastern limit was extended, beyond the example of former
times, as far as the banks of the Araxes, and the neighborhood of the
Caspian. A pious hope was indulged, that the church as well as the state
might triumph in this revolution: but if Chosroes had sincerely listened
to the Christian bishops, the impression was erased by the zeal and
eloquence of the Magi: if he was armed with philosophic indifference,
he accommodated his belief, or rather his professions, to the various
circumstances of an exile and a sovereign. The imaginary conversion of
the king of Persia was reduced to a local and superstitious veneration
for Sergius, <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> one of the saints of Antioch, who heard his prayers
and appeared to him in dreams; he enriched the shrine with offerings of
gold and silver, and ascribed to this invisible patron the success of
his arms, and the pregnancy of Sira, a devout Christian and the best
beloved of his wives. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> The beauty of Sira, or Schirin, <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> her wit,
her musical talents, are still famous in the history, or rather in
the romances, of the East: her own name is expressive, in the Persian
tongue, of sweetness and grace; and the epithet of Parviz alludes to the
charms of her royal lover. Yet Sira never shared the passions which she
inspired, and the bliss of Chosroes was tortured by a jealous doubt,
that while he possessed her person, she had bestowed her affections on a
meaner favorite. <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XLVI: Troubles In Persia.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
While the majesty of the Roman name was revived in the East, the
prospect of Europe is less pleasing and less glorious. By the departure
of the Lombards, and the ruin of the Gepidae, the balance of power was
destroyed on the Danube; and the Avars spread their permanent dominion
from the foot of the Alps to the sea-coast of the Euxine. The reign
of Baian is the brightest aera of their monarchy; their chagan, who
occupied the rustic palace of Attila, appears to have imitated his
character and policy; <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> but as the same scenes were repeated in a
smaller circle, a minute representation of the copy would be devoid
of the greatness and novelty of the original. The pride of the second
Justin, of Tiberius, and Maurice, was humbled by a proud Barbarian, more
prompt to inflict, than exposed to suffer, the injuries of war; and as
often as Asia was threatened by the Persian arms, Europe was oppressed
by the dangerous inroads, or costly friendship, of the Avars. When the
Roman envoys approached the presence of the chagan, they were commanded
to wait at the door of his tent, till, at the end perhaps of ten or
twelve days, he condescended to admit them. If the substance or the
style of their message was offensive to his ear, he insulted, with real
or affected fury, their own dignity, and that of their prince; their
baggage was plundered, and their lives were only saved by the promise
of a richer present and a more respectful address. But his sacred
ambassadors enjoyed and abused an unbounded license in the midst of
Constantinople: they urged, with importunate clamors, the increase of
tribute, or the restitution of captives and deserters: and the majesty
of the empire was almost equally degraded by a base compliance, or
by the false and fearful excuses with which they eluded such insolent
demands. The chagan had never seen an elephant; and his curiosity was
excited by the strange, and perhaps fabulous, portrait of that wonderful
animal. At his command, one of the largest elephants of the Imperial
stables was equipped with stately caparisons, and conducted by a
numerous train to the royal village in the plains of Hungary. He
surveyed the enormous beast with surprise, with disgust, and possibly
with terror; and smiled at the vain industry of the Romans, who, in
search of such useless rarities, could explore the limits of the land
and sea. He wished, at the expense of the emperor, to repose in a golden
bed. The wealth of Constantinople, and the skilful diligence of her
artists, were instantly devoted to the gratification of his caprice; but
when the work was finished, he rejected with scorn a present so unworthy
the majesty of a great king. <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> These were the casual sallies of his
pride; but the avarice of the chagan was a more steady and tractable
passion: a rich and regular supply of silk apparel, furniture, and
plate, introduced the rudiments of art and luxury among the tents of the
Scythians; their appetite was stimulated by the pepper and cinnamon of
India; <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> the annual subsidy or tribute was raised from fourscore to
one hundred and twenty thousand pieces of gold; and after each hostile
interruption, the payment of the arrears, with exorbitant interest, was
always made the first condition of the new treaty. In the language of a
Barbarian, without guile, the prince of the Avars affected to complain
of the insincerity of the Greeks; <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> yet he was not inferior to the
most civilized nations in the refinement of dissimulation and perfidy.
As the successor of the Lombards, the chagan asserted his claim to
the important city of Sirmium, the ancient bulwark of the Illyrian
provinces. <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> The plains of the Lower Hungary were covered with the
Avar horse and a fleet of large boats was built in the Hercynian wood,
to descend the Danube, and to transport into the Save the materials of
a bridge. But as the strong garrison of Singidunum, which commanded the
conflux of the two rivers, might have stopped their passage and baffled
his designs, he dispelled their apprehensions by a solemn oath that his
views were not hostile to the empire. He swore by his sword, the symbol
of the god of war, that he did not, as the enemy of Rome, construct
a bridge upon the Save. "If I violate my oath," pursued the intrepid
Baian, "may I myself, and the last of my nation, perish by the sword!
May the heavens, and fire, the deity of the heavens, fall upon our
heads! May the forests and mountains bury us in their ruins! and the
Save returning, against the laws of nature, to his source, overwhelm
us in his angry waters!" After this barbarous imprecation, he calmly
inquired, what oath was most sacred and venerable among the Christians,
what guilt or perjury it was most dangerous to incur. The bishop of
Singidunum presented the gospel, which the chagan received with devout
reverence. "I swear," said he, "by the God who has spoken in this holy
book, that I have neither falsehood on my tongue, nor treachery in my
heart." As soon as he rose from his knees, he accelerated the labor of
the bridge, and despatched an envoy to proclaim what he no longer wished
to conceal. "Inform the emperor," said the perfidious Baian, "that
Sirmium is invested on every side. Advise his prudence to withdraw
the citizens and their effects, and to resign a city which it is now
impossible to relieve or defend." Without the hope of relief, the
defence of Sirmium was prolonged above three years: the walls were still
untouched; but famine was enclosed within the walls, till a merciful
capitulation allowed the escape of the naked and hungry inhabitants.
Singidunum, at the distance of fifty miles, experienced a more cruel
fate: the buildings were razed, and the vanquished people was condemned
to servitude and exile. Yet the ruins of Sirmium are no longer visible;
the advantageous situation of Singidunum soon attracted a new colony of
Sclavonians, and the conflux of the Save and Danube is still guarded
by the fortifications of Belgrade, or the White City, so often and
so obstinately disputed by the Christian and Turkish arms. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> From
Belgrade to the walls of Constantinople a line may be measured of six
hundred miles: that line was marked with flames and with blood; the
horses of the Avars were alternately bathed in the Euxine and the
Adriatic; and the Roman pontiff, alarmed by the approach of a more
savage enemy, <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> was reduced to cherish the Lombards, as the
protectors of Italy. The despair of a captive, whom his country refused
to ransom, disclosed to the Avars the invention and practice of military
engines. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> But in the first attempts they were rudely framed, and
awkwardly managed; and the resistance of Diocletianopolis and Beraea, of
Philippopolis and Adrianople, soon exhausted the skill and patience of
the besiegers. The warfare of Baian was that of a Tartar; yet his mind
was susceptible of a humane and generous sentiment: he spared Anchialus,
whose salutary waters had restored the health of the best beloved of his
wives; and the Romans confessed, that their starving army was fed and
dismissed by the liberality of a foe. His empire extended over Hungary,
Poland, and Prussia, from the mouth of the Danube to that of the Oder;
<a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> and his new subjects were divided and transplanted by the jealous
policy of the conqueror. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> The eastern regions of Germany, which had
been left vacant by the emigration of the Vandals, were replenished with
Sclavonian colonists; the same tribes are discovered in the neighborhood
of the Adriatic and of the Baltic, and with the name of Baian himself,
the Illyrian cities of Neyss and Lissa are again found in the heart of
Silesia. In the disposition both of his troops and provinces the chagan
exposed the vassals, whose lives he disregarded, <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> to the first
assault; and the swords of the enemy were blunted before they
encountered the native valor of the Avars.

The Persian alliance restored the troops of the East to the defence of
Europe: and Maurice, who had supported ten years the insolence of
the chagan, declared his resolution to march in person against the
Barbarians. In the space of two centuries, none of the successors of
Theodosius had appeared in the field: their lives were supinely spent in
the palace of Constantinople; and the Greeks could no longer understand,
that the name of emperor, in its primitive sense, denoted the chief of
the armies of the republic. The martial ardor of Maurice was opposed
by the grave flattery of the senate, the timid superstition of the
patriarch, and the tears of the empress Constantina; and they all
conjured him to devolve on some meaner general the fatigues and perils
of a Scythian campaign. Deaf to their advice and entreaty, the emperor
boldly advanced <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> seven miles from the capital; the sacred ensign
of the cross was displayed in the front; and Maurice reviewed, with
conscious pride, the arms and numbers of the veterans who had fought and
conquered beyond the Tigris. Anchialus was the last term of his progress
by sea and land; he solicited, without success, a miraculous answer
to his nocturnal prayers; his mind was confounded by the death of a
favorite horse, the encounter of a wild boar, a storm of wind and rain,
and the birth of a monstrous child; and he forgot that the best of omens
is to unsheathe our sword in the defence of our country. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> Under the
pretence of receiving the ambassadors of Persia, the emperor returned to
Constantinople, exchanged the thoughts of war for those of devotion,
and disappointed the public hope by his absence and the choice of his
lieutenants. The blind partiality of fraternal love might excuse the
promotion of his brother Peter, who fled with equal disgrace from the
Barbarians, from his own soldiers and from the inhabitants of a Roman
city. That city, if we may credit the resemblance of name and character,
was the famous Azimuntium, <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> which had alone repelled the tempest of
Attila. The example of her warlike youth was propagated to succeeding
generations; and they obtained, from the first or the second Justin, an
honorable privilege, that their valor should be always reserved for the
defence of their native country. The brother of Maurice attempted
to violate this privilege, and to mingle a patriot band with the
mercenaries of his camp; they retired to the church, he was not awed
by the sanctity of the place; the people rose in their cause, the gates
were shut, the ramparts were manned; and the cowardice of Peter was
found equal to his arrogance and injustice. The military fame of
Commentiolus <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> is the object of satire or comedy rather than of
serious history, since he was even deficient in the vile and vulgar
qualification of personal courage. His solemn councils, strange
evolutions, and secret orders, always supplied an apology for flight or
delay. If he marched against the enemy, the pleasant valleys of Mount
Haemus opposed an insuperable barrier; but in his retreat, he explored,
with fearless curiosity, the most difficult and obsolete paths, which
had almost escaped the memory of the oldest native. The only blood which
he lost was drawn, in a real or affected malady, by the lancet of a
surgeon; and his health, which felt with exquisite sensibility the
approach of the Barbarians, was uniformly restored by the repose and
safety of the winter season. A prince who could promote and support this
unworthy favorite must derive no glory from the accidental merit of his
colleague Priscus. <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> In five successive battles, which seem to have
been conducted with skill and resolution, seventeen thousand two hundred
Barbarians were made prisoners: near sixty thousand, with four sons of
the chagan, were slain: the Roman general surprised a peaceful district
of the Gepidae, who slept under the protection of the Avars; and his
last trophies were erected on the banks of the Danube and the Teyss.
Since the death of Trajan the arms of the empire had not penetrated so
deeply into the old Dacia: yet the success of Priscus was transient and
barren; and he was soon recalled by the apprehension that Baian, with
dauntless spirit and recruited forces, was preparing to avenge his
defeat under the walls of Constantinople. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a>

[ The general detail of the war against the Avars may be
traced in the first, second, sixth, seventh, and eighth books of the
history of the emperor Maurice, by Theophylact Simocatta. As he wrote in
the reign of Heraclius, he had no temptation to flatter; but his want
of judgment renders him diffuse in trifles, and concise in the most
interesting facts.]
</p>
<p>
The theory of war was not more familiar to the camps of Caesar and
Trajan, than to those of Justinian and Maurice. <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> The iron of Tuscany
or Pontus still received the keenest temper from the skill of the
Byzantine workmen. The magazines were plentifully stored with every
species of offensive and defensive arms. In the construction and use of
ships, engines, and fortifications, the Barbarians admired the superior
ingenuity of a people whom they had so often vanquished in the field.
The science of tactics, the order, evolutions, and stratagems of
antiquity, was transcribed and studied in the books of the Greeks and
Romans. But the solitude or degeneracy of the provinces could no longer
supply a race of men to handle those weapons, to guard those walls,
to navigate those ships, and to reduce the theory of war into bold and
successful practice. The genius of Belisarius and Narses had been formed
without a master, and expired without a disciple Neither honor, nor
patriotism, nor generous superstition, could animate the lifeless bodies
of slaves and strangers, who had succeeded to the honors of the legions:
it was in the camp alone that the emperor should have exercised a
despotic command; it was only in the camps that his authority was
disobeyed and insulted: he appeased and inflamed with gold the
licentiousness of the troops; but their vices were inherent, their
victories were accidental, and their costly maintenance exhausted the
substance of a state which they were unable to defend. After a long and
pernicious indulgence, the cure of this inveterate evil was undertaken
by Maurice; but the rash attempt, which drew destruction on his own
head, tended only to aggravate the disease. A reformer should be exempt
from the suspicion of interest, and he must possess the confidence and
esteem of those whom he proposes to reclaim. The troops of Maurice
might listen to the voice of a victorious leader; they disdained the
admonitions of statesmen and sophists; and, when they received an edict
which deducted from their pay the price of their arms and clothing, they
execrated the avarice of a prince insensible of the dangers and fatigues
from which he had escaped.
</p>
<p>
The camps both of Asia and Europe were agitated with frequent and
furious seditions; <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> the enraged soldiers of Edessa pursued with
reproaches, with threats, with wounds, their trembling generals;
they overturned the statues of the emperor, cast stones against the
miraculous image of Christ, and either rejected the yoke of all
civil and military laws, or instituted a dangerous model of voluntary
subordination. The monarch, always distant and often deceived, was
incapable of yielding or persisting, according to the exigence of the
moment. But the fear of a general revolt induced him too readily to
accept any act of valor, or any expression of loyalty, as an atonement
for the popular offence; the new reform was abolished as hastily as it
had been announced, and the troops, instead of punishment and restraint,
were agreeably surprised by a gracious proclamation of immunities and
rewards. But the soldiers accepted without gratitude the tardy and
reluctant gifts of the emperor: their insolence was elated by the
discovery of his weakness and their own strength; and their mutual
hatred was inflamed beyond the desire of forgiveness or the hope of
reconciliation. The historians of the times adopt the vulgar suspicion,
that Maurice conspired to destroy the troops whom he had labored to
reform; the misconduct and favor of Commentiolus are imputed to this
malevolent design; and every age must condemn the inhumanity of avarice
<a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> of a prince, who, by the trifling ransom of six thousand pieces of
gold, might have prevented the massacre of twelve thousand prisoners in
the hands of the chagan. In the just fervor of indignation, an order
was signified to the army of the Danube, that they should spare the
magazines of the province, and establish their winter quarters in the
hostile country of the Avars. The measure of their grievances was full:
they pronounced Maurice unworthy to reign, expelled or slaughtered
his faithful adherents, and, under the command of Phocas, a
simple centurion, returned by hasty marches to the neighborhood of
Constantinople. After a long series of legal succession, the military
disorders of the third century were again revived; yet such was the
novelty of the enterprise, that the insurgents were awed by their
own rashness. They hesitated to invest their favorite with the vacant
purple; and, while they rejected all treaty with Maurice himself,
they held a friendly correspondence with his son Theodosius, and with
Germanus, the father-in-law of the royal youth. So obscure had been the
former condition of Phocas, that the emperor was ignorant of the
name and character of his rival; but as soon as he learned, that the
centurion, though bold in sedition, was timid in the face of danger,
"Alas!" cried the desponding prince, "if he is a coward, he will surely
be a murderer."

</p>
<p>
Yet if Constantinople had been firm and faithful, the murderer might
have spent his fury against the walls; and the rebel army would have
been gradually consumed or reconciled by the prudence of the emperor.
In the games of the Circus, which he repeated with unusual pomp,
Maurice disguised, with smiles of confidence, the anxiety of his heart,
condescended to solicit the applause of the factions, and flattered
their pride by accepting from their respective tribunes a list of nine
hundred blues and fifteen hundred greens, whom he affected to esteem
as the solid pillars of his throne Their treacherous or languid support
betrayed his weakness and hastened his fall: the green faction were the
secret accomplices of the rebels, and the blues recommended lenity
and moderation in a contest with their Roman brethren The rigid and
parsimonious virtues of Maurice had long since alienated the hearts of
his subjects: as he walked barefoot in a religious procession, he was
rudely assaulted with stones, and his guards were compelled to present
their iron maces in the defence of his person. A fanatic monk ran
through the streets with a drawn sword, denouncing against him the
wrath and the sentence of God; and a vile plebeian, who represented
his countenance and apparel, was seated on an ass, and pursued by the
imprecations of the multitude. <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> The emperor suspected the popularity
of Germanus with the soldiers and citizens: he feared, he threatened,
but he delayed to strike; the patrician fled to the sanctuary of the
church; the people rose in his defence, the walls were deserted by the
guards, and the lawless city was abandoned to the flames and rapine of
a nocturnal tumult. In a small bark, the unfortunate Maurice, with his
wife and nine children, escaped to the Asiatic shore; but the violence
of the wind compelled him to land at the church of St. Autonomus, <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a>
near Chalcedon, from whence he despatched Theodosius, he eldest son,
to implore the gratitude and friendship of the Persian monarch. For
himself, he refused to fly: his body was tortured with sciatic pains,
<a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> his mind was enfeebled by superstition; he patiently awaited the
event of the revolution, and addressed a fervent and public prayer to
the Almighty, that the punishment of his sins might be inflicted in this
world rather than in a future life. After the abdication of Maurice, the
two factions disputed the choice of an emperor; but the favorite of the
blues was rejected by the jealousy of their antagonists, and Germanus
himself was hurried along by the crowds who rushed to the palace of
Hebdomon, seven miles from the city, to adore the majesty of Phocas the
centurion. A modest wish of resigning the purple to the rank and merit
of Germanus was opposed by his resolution, more obstinate and equally
sincere; the senate and clergy obeyed his summons; and, as soon as
the patriarch was assured of his orthodox belief, he consecrated the
successful usurper in the church of St. John the Baptist. On the third
day, amidst the acclamations of a thoughtless people, Phocas made his
public entry in a chariot drawn by four white horses: the revolt of the
troops was rewarded by a lavish donative; and the new sovereign, after
visiting the palace, beheld from his throne the games of the hippodrome.
In a dispute of precedency between the two factions, his partial
judgment inclined in favor of the greens. "Remember that Maurice is
still alive," resounded from the opposite side; and the indiscreet
clamor of the blues admonished and stimulated the cruelty of the tyrant.
The ministers of death were despatched to Chalcedon: they dragged
the emperor from his sanctuary; and the five sons of Maurice were
successively murdered before the eyes of their agonizing parent. At
each stroke, which he felt in his heart, he found strength to rehearse
a pious ejaculation: "Thou art just, O Lord! and thy judgments are
righteous." And such, in the last moments, was his rigid attachment to
truth and justice, that he revealed to the soldiers the pious falsehood
of a nurse who presented her own child in the place of a royal infant.
<a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> The tragic scene was finally closed by the execution of the emperor
himself, in the twentieth year of his reign, and the sixty-third of his
age. The bodies of the father and his five sons were cast into the sea;
their heads were exposed at Constantinople to the insults or pity of the
multitude; and it was not till some signs of putrefaction had appeared,
that Phocas connived at the private burial of these venerable remains.
In that grave, the faults and errors of Maurice were kindly interred.
His fate alone was remembered; and at the end of twenty years, in the
recital of the history of Theophylact, the mournful tale was interrupted
by the tears of the audience. <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a>

Such tears must have flowed in secret, and such compassion would have
been criminal, under the reign of Phocas, who was peaceably acknowledged
in the provinces of the East and West. The images of the emperor and his
wife Leontia were exposed in the Lateran to the veneration of the
clergy and senate of Rome, and afterwards deposited in the palace of the
Caesars, between those of Constantine and Theodosius. As a subject and
a Christian, it was the duty of Gregory to acquiesce in the established
government; but the joyful applause with which he salutes the fortune of
the assassin, has sullied, with indelible disgrace, the character of the
saint. The successor of the apostles might have inculcated with decent
firmness the guilt of blood, and the necessity of repentance; he is
content to celebrate the deliverance of the people and the fall of the
oppressor; to rejoice that the piety and benignity of Phocas have been
raised by Providence to the Imperial throne; to pray that his hands may
be strengthened against all his enemies; and to express a wish,
perhaps a prophecy, that, after a long and triumphant reign, he may
be transferred from a temporal to an everlasting kingdom. <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> I have

and drunkenness; and his brutal pleasures were either injurious to his
subjects or disgraceful to himself. Without assuming the office of
a prince, he renounced the profession of a soldier; and the reign of
Phocas afflicted Europe with ignominious peace, and Asia with desolating
war. His savage temper was inflamed by passion, hardened by fear, and
exasperated by resistance of reproach. The flight of Theodosius to the
Persian court had been intercepted by a rapid pursuit, or a deceitful
message: he was beheaded at Nice, and the last hours of the young
prince were soothed by the comforts of religion and the consciousness
of innocence. Yet his phantom disturbed the repose of the usurper: a
whisper was circulated through the East, that the son of Maurice was
still alive: the people expected their avenger, and the widow and
daughters of the late emperor would have adopted as their son and
brother the vilest of mankind. In the massacre of the Imperial family,
<a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> the mercy, or rather the discretion, of Phocas had spared these
unhappy females, and they were decently confined to a private house. But
the spirit of the empress Constantina, still mindful of her father, her
husband, and her sons, aspired to freedom and revenge. At the dead of
night, she escaped to the sanctuary of St. Sophia; but her tears, and
the gold of her associate Germanus, were insufficient to provoke an
insurrection. Her life was forfeited to revenge, and even to justice:
but the patriarch obtained and pledged an oath for her safety: a
monastery was allotted for her prison, and the widow of Maurice accepted
and abused the lenity of his assassin. The discovery or the suspicion of
a second conspiracy, dissolved the engagements, and rekindled the fury,
of Phocas. A matron who commanded the respect and pity of mankind, the
daughter, wife, and mother of emperors, was tortured like the vilest
malefactor, to force a confession of her designs and associates; and the
empress Constantina, with her three innocent daughters, was beheaded at
Chalcedon, on the same ground which had been stained with the blood
of her husband and five sons. After such an example, it would be
superfluous to enumerate the names and sufferings of meaner victims.
Their condemnation was seldom preceded by the forms of trial, and their
punishment was embittered by the refinements of cruelty: their eyes were
pierced, their tongues were torn from the root, the hands and feet were
amputated; some expired under the lash, others in the flames; others
again were transfixed with arrows; and a simple speedy death was mercy
which they could rarely obtain. The hippodrome, the sacred asylum of
the pleasures and the liberty of the Romans, was polluted with heads and
limbs, and mangled bodies; and the companions of Phocas were the most
sensible, that neither his favor, nor their services, could protect them
from a tyrant, the worthy rival of the Caligulas and Domitians of the
first age of the empire. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XLVI: Troubles In Persia.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
A daughter of Phocas, his only child, was given in marriage to the
patrician Crispus, <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> and the royal images of the bride and bridegroom
were indiscreetly placed in the circus, by the side of the emperor. The
father must desire that his posterity should inherit the fruit of his
crimes, but the monarch was offended by this premature and popular
association: the tribunes of the green faction, who accused the
officious error of their sculptors, were condemned to instant death:
their lives were granted to the prayers of the people; but Crispus might
reasonably doubt, whether a jealous usurper could forget and pardon
his involuntary competition. The green faction was alienated by the
ingratitude of Phocas and the loss of their privileges; every province
of the empire was ripe for rebellion; and Heraclius, exarch of Africa,
persisted above two years in refusing all tribute and obedience to the
centurion who disgraced the throne of Constantinople. By the secret
emissaries of Crispus and the senate, the independent exarch was
solicited to save and to govern his country; but his ambition was
chilled by age, and he resigned the dangerous enterprise to his
son Heraclius, and to Nicetas, the son of Gregory, his friend and
lieutenant. The powers of Africa were armed by the two adventurous
youths; they agreed that the one should navigate the fleet from Carthage
to Constantinople, that the other should lead an army through Egypt and
Asia, and that the Imperial purple should be the reward of diligence and
success. A faint rumor of their undertaking was conveyed to the ears of
Phocas, and the wife and mother of the younger Heraclius were secured
as the hostages of his faith: but the treacherous heart of Crispus
extenuated the distant peril, the means of defence were neglected or
delayed, and the tyrant supinely slept till the African navy cast anchor
in the Hellespont. Their standard was joined at Abidus by the fugitives
and exiles who thirsted for revenge; the ships of Heraclius, whose lofty
masts were adorned with the holy symbols of religion, <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> steered their
triumphant course through the Propontis; and Phocas beheld from the
windows of the palace his approaching and inevitable fate. The green
faction was tempted, by gifts and promises, to oppose a feeble and
fruitless resistance to the landing of the Africans: but the people, and
even the guards, were determined by the well-timed defection of Crispus;
and they tyrant was seized by a private enemy, who boldly invaded the
solitude of the palace. Stripped of the diadem and purple, clothed in a
vile habit, and loaded with chains, he was transported in a small boat
to the Imperial galley of Heraclius, who reproached him with the crimes
of his abominable reign. "Wilt thou govern better?" were the last words
of the despair of Phocas. After suffering each variety of insult and
torture, his head was severed from his body, the mangled trunk was cast
into the flames, and the same treatment was inflicted on the statues
of the vain usurper, and the seditious banner of the green faction. The
voice of the clergy, the senate, and the people, invited Heraclius to
ascend the throne which he had purified from guilt and ignominy; after
some graceful hesitation, he yielded to their entreaties. His coronation
was accompanied by that of his wife Eudoxia; and their posterity, till
the fourth generation, continued to reign over the empire of the East.
The voyage of Heraclius had been easy and prosperous; the tedious march
of Nicetas was not accomplished before the decision of the contest:
but he submitted without a murmur to the fortune of his friend, and
his laudable intentions were rewarded with an equestrian statue, and a
daughter of the emperor. It was more difficult to trust the fidelity of
Crispus, whose recent services were recompensed by the command of the
Cappadocian army. His arrogance soon provoked, and seemed to excuse,
the ingratitude of his new sovereign. In the presence of the senate, the
son-in-law of Phocas was condemned to embrace the monastic life; and the
sentence was justified by the weighty observation of Heraclius, that the
man who had betrayed his father could never be faithful to his friend.

Even after his death the republic was afflicted by the crimes of Phocas,
which armed with a pious cause the most formidable of her enemies.
According to the friendly and equal forms of the Byzantine and Persian
courts, he announced his exaltation to the throne; and his ambassador
Lilius, who had presented him with the heads of Maurice and his sons,
was the best qualified to describe the circumstances of the tragic
scene. <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> However it might be varnished by fiction or sophistry,
Chosroes turned with horror from the assassin, imprisoned the pretended
envoy, disclaimed the usurper, and declared himself the avenger of his
father and benefactor. The sentiments of grief and resentment, which
humanity would feel, and honor would dictate, promoted on this occasion
the interest of the Persian king; and his interest was powerfully
magnified by the national and religious prejudices of the Magi and
satraps. In a strain of artful adulation, which assumed the language
of freedom, they presumed to censure the excess of his gratitude and
friendship for the Greeks; a nation with whom it was dangerous to
conclude either peace or alliance; whose superstition was devoid of
truth and justice, and who must be incapable of any virtue, since they
could perpetrate the most atrocious of crimes, the impious murder of
their sovereign. <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> For the crime of an ambitious centurion, the
nation which he oppressed was chastised with the calamities of war; and
the same calamities, at the end of twenty years, were retaliated
and redoubled on the heads of the Persians. <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> The general who had
restored Chosroes to the throne still commanded in the East; and the
name of Narses was the formidable sound with which the Assyrian mothers
were accustomed to terrify their infants. It is not improbable, that a
native subject of Persia should encourage his master and his friend to
deliver and possess the provinces of Asia. It is still more probable,
that Chosroes should animate his troops by the assurance that the sword
which they dreaded the most would remain in its scabbard, or be drawn in
their favor. The hero could not depend on the faith of a tyrant; and
the tyrant was conscious how little he deserved the obedience of a hero.
Narses was removed from his military command; he reared an independent
standard at Hierapolis, in Syria: he was betrayed by fallacious
promises, and burnt alive in the market-place of Constantinople.
Deprived of the only chief whom they could fear or esteem, the bands
which he had led to victory were twice broken by the cavalry, trampled
by the elephants, and pierced by the arrows of the Barbarians; and a
great number of the captives were beheaded on the field of battle by
the sentence of the victor, who might justly condemn these seditious
mercenaries as the authors or accomplices of the death of Maurice. Under
the reign of Phocas, the fortifications of Merdin, Dara, Amida, and
Edessa, were successively besieged, reduced, and destroyed, by the
Persian monarch: he passed the Euphrates, occupied the Syrian cities,
Hierapolis, Chalcis, and Berrhaea or Aleppo, and soon encompassed the
walls of Antioch with his irresistible arms. The rapid tide of success
discloses the decay of the empire, the incapacity of Phocas, and the
disaffection of his subjects; and Chosroes provided a decent apology for
their submission or revolt, by an impostor, who attended his camp as the
son of Maurice <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> and the lawful heir of the monarchy.

</p>
<p>
The first intelligence from the East which Heraclius received, <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a>
was that of the loss of Antioch; but the aged metropolis, so often
overturned by earthquakes, and pillaged by the enemy, could supply but
a small and languid stream of treasure and blood. The Persians were
equally successful, and more fortunate, in the sack of Caesarea, the
capital of Cappadocia; and as they advanced beyond the ramparts of
the frontier, the boundary of ancient war, they found a less obstinate
resistance and a more plentiful harvest. The pleasant vale of Damascus
has been adorned in every age with a royal city: her obscure felicity
has hitherto escaped the historian of the Roman empire: but Chosroes
reposed his troops in the paradise of Damascus before he ascended the
hills of Libanus, or invaded the cities of the Phoenician coast. The
conquest of Jerusalem, <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> which had been meditated by Nushirvan,
was achieved by the zeal and avarice of his grandson; the ruin of the
proudest monument of Christianity was vehemently urged by the intolerant
spirit of the Magi; and he could enlist for this holy warfare with
an army of six-and-twenty thousand Jews, whose furious bigotry might
compensate, in some degree, for the want of valor and discipline. <a href="#note-6011" name="noteref-6011"><small>6011</small></a>
After the reduction of Galilee, and the region beyond the Jordan, whose
resistance appears to have delayed the fate of the capital, Jerusalem
itself was taken by assault. The sepulchre of Christ, and the stately
churches of Helena and Constantine, were consumed, or at least damaged,
by the flames; the devout offerings of three hundred years were rifled
in one sacrilegious day; the Patriarch Zachariah, and the true cross,
were transported into Persia; and the massacre of ninety thousand
Christians is imputed to the Jews and Arabs, who swelled the disorder
of the Persian march. The fugitives of Palestine were entertained at
Alexandria by the charity of John the Archbishop, who is distinguished
among a crowd of saints by the epithet of almsgiver: <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> and the
revenues of the church, with a treasure of three hundred thousand
pounds, were restored to the true proprietors, the poor of every country
and every denomination. But Egypt itself, the only province which had
been exempt, since the time of Diocletian, from foreign and domestic
war, was again subdued by the successors of Cyrus. Pelusium, the key of
that impervious country, was surprised by the cavalry of the Persians:
they passed, with impunity, the innumerable channels of the Delta, and
explored the long valley of the Nile, from the pyramids of Memphis to
the confines of Aethiopia. Alexandria might have been relieved by a
naval force, but the archbishop and the praefect embarked for Cyprus;
and Chosroes entered the second city of the empire, which still
preserved a wealthy remnant of industry and commerce. His western trophy
was erected, not on the walls of Carthage, <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> but in the neighborhood
of Tripoli; the Greek colonies of Cyrene were finally extirpated; and
the conqueror, treading in the footsteps of Alexander, returned in
triumph through the sands of the Libyan desert. In the same campaign,
another army advanced from the Euphrates to the Thracian Bosphorus;
Chalcedon surrendered after a long siege, and a Persian camp was
maintained above ten years in the presence of Constantinople. The
sea-coast of Pontus, the city of Ancyra, and the Isle of Rhodes, are
enumerated among the last conquests of the great king; and if Chosroes
had possessed any maritime power, his boundless ambition would have
spread slavery and desolation over the provinces of Europe.

</p>
<p>
From the long-disputed banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, the reign of
the grandson of Nushirvan was suddenly extended to the Hellespont and
the Nile, the ancient limits of the Persian monarchy. But the provinces,
which had been fashioned by the habits of six hundred years to the
virtues and vices of the Roman government, supported with reluctance
the yoke of the Barbarians. The idea of a republic was kept alive by the
institutions, or at least by the writings, of the Greeks and Romans, and
the subjects of Heraclius had been educated to pronounce the words of
liberty and law. But it has always been the pride and policy of Oriental
princes to display the titles and attributes of their omnipotence; to
upbraid a nation of slaves with their true name and abject condition,
and to enforce, by cruel and insolent threats, the rigor of their
absolute commands. The Christians of the East were scandalized by the
worship of fire, and the impious doctrine of the two principles: the
Magi were not less intolerant than the bishops; and the martyrdom of
some native Persians, who had deserted the religion of Zoroaster, <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a>
was conceived to be the prelude of a fierce and general persecution.
By the oppressive laws of Justinian, the adversaries of the church were
made the enemies of the state; the alliance of the Jews, Nestorians, and
Jacobites, had contributed to the success of Chosroes, and his partial
favor to the sectaries provoked the hatred and fears of the Catholic
clergy. Conscious of their fear and hatred, the Persian conqueror
governed his new subjects with an iron sceptre; and, as if he suspected
the stability of his dominion, he exhausted their wealth by exorbitant
tributes and licentious rapine despoiled or demolished the temples of
the East; and transported to his hereditary realms the gold, the silver,
the precious marbles, the arts, and the artists of the Asiatic cities.
In the obscure picture of the calamities of the empire, <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> it is not
easy to discern the figure of Chosroes himself, to separate his actions
from those of his lieutenants, or to ascertain his personal merit in the
general blaze of glory and magnificence. He enjoyed with ostentation the
fruits of victory, and frequently retired from the hardships of war to
the luxury of the palace. But in the space of twenty-four years, he was
deterred by superstition or resentment from approaching the gates of
Ctesiphon: and his favorite residence of Artemita, or Dastagerd,
was situate beyond the Tigris, about sixty miles to the north of the
capital. <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> The adjacent pastures were covered with flocks and
herds: the paradise or park was replenished with pheasants, peacocks,
ostriches, roebucks, and wild boars, and the noble game of lions and
tigers was sometimes turned loose for the bolder pleasures of the chase.
Nine hundred and sixty elephants were maintained for the use or splendor
of the great king: his tents and baggage were carried into the field by
twelve thousand great camels and eight thousand of a smaller size; <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a>
and the royal stables were filled with six thousand mules and horses,
among whom the names of Shebdiz and Barid are renowned for their speed
or beauty. <a href="#note-6611" name="noteref-6611"><small>6611</small></a> Six thousand guards successively mounted before the
palace gate; the service of the interior apartments was performed by
twelve thousand slaves, and in the number of three thousand virgins, the
fairest of Asia, some happy concubine might console her master for the
age or the indifference of Sira.
</p>
<p>
The various treasures of gold, silver, gems, silks, and aromatics, were
deposited in a hundred subterraneous vaults and the chamber Badaverd
denoted the accidental gift of the winds which had wafted the spoils
of Heraclius into one of the Syrian harbors of his rival. The vice of
flattery, and perhaps of fiction, is not ashamed to compute the thirty
thousand rich hangings that adorned the walls; the forty thousand
columns of silver, or more probably of marble, and plated wood, that
supported the roof; and the thousand globes of gold suspended in the
dome, to imitate the motions of the planets and the constellations of
the zodiac. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> While the Persian monarch contemplated the wonders of
his art and power, he received an epistle from an obscure citizen of
Mecca, inviting him to acknowledge Mahomet as the apostle of God. He
rejected the invitation, and tore the epistle. "It is thus," exclaimed
the Arabian prophet, "that God will tear the kingdom, and reject the
supplications of Chosroes." <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> 
<a href="#note-6811" name="noteref-6811"><small>6811</small></a> Placed on the verge of the two great
empires of the East, Mahomet observed with secret joy the progress of
their mutual destruction; and in the midst of the Persian triumphs,

should again return to the banners of the Romans. <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a>

</p>
<p>
At the time when this prediction is said to have been delivered, no
prophecy could be more distant from its accomplishment, since the first
twelve years of Heraclius announced the approaching dissolution of the
empire. If the motives of Chosroes had been pure and honorable, he
must have ended the quarrel with the death of Phocas, and he would have
embraced, as his best ally, the fortunate African who had so generously
avenged the injuries of his benefactor Maurice. The prosecution of the
war revealed the true character of the Barbarian; and the suppliant
embassies of Heraclius to beseech his clemency, that he would spare the
innocent, accept a tribute, and give peace to the world, were rejected
with contemptuous silence or insolent menace. Syria, Egypt, and the
provinces of Asia, were subdued by the Persian arms, while Europe, from
the confines of Istria to the long wall of Thrace, was oppressed by the
Avars, unsatiated with the blood and rapine of the Italian war. They had
coolly massacred their male captives in the sacred field of Pannonia;
the women and children were reduced to servitude, and the noblest
virgins were abandoned to the promiscuous lust of the Barbarians. The
amorous matron who opened the gates of Friuli passed a short night in
the arms of her royal lover; the next evening, Romilda was condemned to
the embraces of twelve Avars, and the third day the Lombard princess was
impaled in the sight of the camp, while the chagan observed with a cruel
smile, that such a husband was the fit recompense of her lewdness and
perfidy. <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> By these implacable enemies, Heraclius, on either side,
was insulted and besieged: and the Roman empire was reduced to the walls
of Constantinople, with the remnant of Greece, Italy, and Africa, and
some maritime cities, from Tyre to Trebizond, of the Asiatic coast.
After the loss of Egypt, the capital was afflicted by famine and
pestilence; and the emperor, incapable of resistance, and hopeless of
relief, had resolved to transfer his person and government to the more
secure residence of Carthage. His ships were already laden with the
treasures of the palace; but his flight was arrested by the patriarch,
who armed the powers of religion in the defence of his country; led
Heraclius to the altar of St. Sophia, and extorted a solemn oath, that
he would live and die with the people whom God had intrusted to his
care. The chagan was encamped in the plains of Thrace; but he dissembled
his perfidious designs, and solicited an interview with the emperor
near the town of Heraclea. Their reconciliation was celebrated with
equestrian games; the senate and people, in their gayest apparel,
resorted to the festival of peace; and the Avars beheld, with envy and
desire, the spectacle of Roman luxury. On a sudden the hippodrome was
encompassed by the Scythian cavalry, who had pressed their secret and
nocturnal march: the tremendous sound of the chagan's whip gave the
signal of the assault, and Heraclius, wrapping his diadem round his arm,
was saved with extreme hazard, by the fleetness of his horse. So rapid
was the pursuit, that the Avars almost entered the golden gate of
Constantinople with the flying crowds: <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> but the plunder of the
suburbs rewarded their treason, and they transported beyond the Danube
two hundred and seventy thousand captives. On the shore of Chalcedon,
the emperor held a safer conference with a more honorable foe, who,
before Heraclius descended from his galley, saluted with reverence and
pity the majesty of the purple. The friendly offer of Sain, the Persian
general, to conduct an embassy to the presence of the great king, was
accepted with the warmest gratitude, and the prayer for pardon and peace
was humbly presented by the Praetorian praefect, the praefect of the
city, and one of the first ecclesiastics of the patriarchal church. <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a>
But the lieutenant of Chosroes had fatally mistaken the intentions of
his master. "It was not an embassy," said the tyrant of Asia, "it was
the person of Heraclius, bound in chains, that he should have brought to
the foot of my throne. I will never give peace to the emperor of Rome,
till he had abjured his crucified God, and embraced the worship of the
sun." Sain was flayed alive, according to the inhuman practice of his
country; and the separate and rigorous confinement of the ambassadors
violated the law of nations, and the faith of an express stipulation.
Yet the experience of six years at length persuaded the Persian monarch
to renounce the conquest of Constantinople, and to specify the annual
tribute or ransom of the Roman empire; a thousand talents of gold, a
thousand talents of silver, a thousand silk robes, a thousand horses,
and a thousand virgins. Heraclius subscribed these ignominious terms;
but the time and space which he obtained to collect such treasures from
the poverty of the East, was industriously employed in the preparations
of a bold and desperate attack.

</p>
<p>
Of the characters conspicuous in history, that of Heraclius is one of
the most extraordinary and inconsistent. In the first and last years of
a long reign, the emperor appears to be the slave of sloth, of pleasure,
or of superstition, the careless and impotent spectator of the public
calamities. But the languid mists of the morning and evening are
separated by the brightness of the meridian sun; the Arcadius of the
palace arose the Caesar of the camp; and the honor of Rome and Heraclius
was gloriously retrieved by the exploits and trophies of six adventurous
campaigns. It was the duty of the Byzantine historians to have revealed
the causes of his slumber and vigilance. At this distance we can
only conjecture, that he was endowed with more personal courage than
political resolution; that he was detained by the charms, and perhaps
the arts, of his niece Martina, with whom, after the death of Eudocia,
he contracted an incestuous marriage; <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> and that he yielded to the
base advice of the counsellors, who urged, as a fundamental law, that
the life of the emperor should never be exposed in the field. <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a>
Perhaps he was awakened by the last insolent demand of the Persian
conqueror; but at the moment when Heraclius assumed the spirit of a
hero, the only hopes of the Romans were drawn from the vicissitudes of
fortune, which might threaten the proud prosperity of Chosroes, and must
be favorable to those who had attained the lowest period of depression.
<a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> To provide for the expenses of war, was the first care of the
emperor; and for the purpose of collecting the tribute, he was allowed
to solicit the benevolence of the eastern provinces. But the revenue no
longer flowed in the usual channels; the credit of an arbitrary prince
is annihilated by his power; and the courage of Heraclius was first
displayed in daring to borrow the consecrated wealth of churches, under
the solemn vow of restoring, with usury, whatever he had been compelled
to employ in the service of religion and the empire. The clergy
themselves appear to have sympathized with the public distress; and the
discreet patriarch of Alexandria, without admitting the precedent
of sacrilege, assisted his sovereign by the miraculous or seasonable
revelation of a secret treasure. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a> Of the soldiers who had conspired
with Phocas, only two were found to have survived the stroke of time and
of the Barbarians; <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> the loss, even of these seditious veterans, was
imperfectly supplied by the new levies of Heraclius, and the gold of the
sanctuary united, in the same camp, the names, and arms, and languages
of the East and West. He would have been content with the neutrality of
the Avars; and his friendly entreaty, that the chagan would act, not as
the enemy, but as the guardian, of the empire, was accompanied with a
more persuasive donative of two hundred thousand pieces of gold. Two
days after the festival of Easter, the emperor, exchanging his purple
for the simple garb of a penitent and warrior, <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> gave the signal
of his departure. To the faith of the people Heraclius recommended
his children; the civil and military powers were vested in the most
deserving hands, and the discretion of the patriarch and senate was
authorized to save or surrender the city, if they should be oppressed
in his absence by the superior forces of the enemy.

<p>
The neighboring heights of Chalcedon were covered with tents and arms:
but if the new levies of Heraclius had been rashly led to the attack,
the victory of the Persians in the sight of Constantinople might have
been the last day of the Roman empire. As imprudent would it have been
to advance into the provinces of Asia, leaving their innumerable cavalry
to intercept his convoys, and continually to hang on the lassitude and
disorder of his rear. But the Greeks were still masters of the sea;
a fleet of galleys, transports, and store-ships, was assembled in the
harbor; the Barbarians consented to embark; a steady wind carried them
through the Hellespont the western and southern coast of Asia Minor lay
on their left hand; the spirit of their chief was first displayed in a
storm, and even the eunuchs of his train were excited to suffer and
to work by the example of their master. He landed his troops on the
confines of Syria and Cilicia, in the Gulf of Scanderoon, where
the coast suddenly turns to the south; <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> and his discernment was
expressed in the choice of this important post. <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> From all sides,
the scattered garrisons of the maritime cities and the mountains might
repair with speed and safety to his Imperial standard. The natural
fortifications of Cilicia protected, and even concealed, the camp
of Heraclius, which was pitched near Issus, on the same ground where
Alexander had vanquished the host of Darius. The angle which the emperor
occupied was deeply indented into a vast semicircle of the Asiatic,
Armenian, and Syrian provinces; and to whatsoever point of the
circumference he should direct his attack, it was easy for him to
dissemble his own motions, and to prevent those of the enemy. In the
camp of Issus, the Roman general reformed the sloth and disorder of the
veterans, and educated the new recruits in the knowledge and practice of
military virtue. Unfolding the miraculous image of Christ, he urged them
to revenge the holy altars which had been profaned by the worshippers
of fire; addressing them by the endearing appellations of sons and
brethren, he deplored the public and private wrongs of the republic. The
subjects of a monarch were persuaded that they fought in the cause
of freedom; and a similar enthusiasm was communicated to the foreign
mercenaries, who must have viewed with equal indifference the interest
of Rome and of Persia. Heraclius himself, with the skill and patience
of a centurion, inculcated the lessons of the school of tactics, and the
soldiers were assiduously trained in the use of their weapons, and the
exercises and evolutions of the field. The cavalry and infantry in light
or heavy armor were divided into two parties; the trumpets were fixed
in the centre, and their signals directed the march, the charge, the
retreat or pursuit; the direct or oblique order, the deep or extended
phalanx; to represent in fictitious combat the operations of genuine
war. Whatever hardships the emperor imposed on the troops, he inflicted
with equal severity on himself; their labor, their diet, their sleep,
were measured by the inflexible rules of discipline; and, without
despising the enemy, they were taught to repose an implicit confidence
in their own valor and the wisdom of their leader. Cilicia was soon
encompassed with the Persian arms; but their cavalry hesitated to
enter the defiles of Mount Taurus, till they were circumvented by the
evolutions of Heraclius, who insensibly gained their rear, whilst he
appeared to present his front in order of battle. By a false motion,
which seemed to threaten Armenia, he drew them, against their wishes, to
a general action. They were tempted by the artful disorder of his
camp; but when they advanced to combat, the ground, the sun, and the
expectation of both armies, were unpropitious to the Barbarians; the
Romans successfully repeated their tactics in a field of battle, <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a>
and the event of the day declared to the world, that the Persians were
not invincible, and that a hero was invested with the purple. Strong in
victory and fame, Heraclius boldly ascended the heights of Mount Taurus,
directed his march through the plains of Cappadocia, and established
his troops, for the winter season, in safe and plentiful quarters on the
banks of the River Halys. <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a> His soul was superior to the vanity of
entertaining Constantinople with an imperfect triumph; but the presence
of the emperor was indispensably required to soothe the restless and
rapacious spirit of the Avars.

</p>
<p>
Since the days of Scipio and Hannibal, no bolder enterprise has been
attempted than that which Heraclius achieved for the deliverance of
the empire <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> He permitted the Persians to oppress for a while the
provinces, and to insult with impunity the capital of the East; while
the Roman emperor explored his perilous way through the Black Sea, <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a>
and the mountains of Armenia, penetrated into the heart of Persia,
<a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> and recalled the armies of the great king to the defence of
their bleeding country. With a select band of five thousand soldiers,
Heraclius sailed from Constantinople to Trebizond; assembled his forces
which had wintered in the Pontic regions; and, from the mouth of the
Phasis to the Caspian Sea, encouraged his subjects and allies to march
with the successor of Constantine under the faithful and victorious
banner of the cross. When the legions of Lucullus and Pompey first
passed the Euphrates, they blushed at their easy victory over the
natives of Armenia. But the long experience of war had hardened the
minds and bodies of that effeminate peeple; their zeal and bravery were
approved in the service of a declining empire; they abhorred and feared
the usurpation of the house of Sassan, and the memory of persecution
envenomed their pious hatred of the enemies of Christ. The limits of
Armenia, as it had been ceded to the emperor Maurice, extended as far as
the Araxes: the river submitted to the indignity of a bridge, <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> and
Heraclius, in the footsteps of Mark Antony, advanced towards the city
of Tauris or Gandzaca, <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a> the ancient and modern capital of one of the
provinces of Media. At the head of forty thousand men, Chosroes himself
had returned from some distant expedition to oppose the progress of the
Roman arms; but he retreated on the approach of Heraclius, declining the
generous alternative of peace or of battle. Instead of half a million of
inhabitants, which have been ascribed to Tauris under the reign of the
Sophys, the city contained no more than three thousand houses; but the
value of the royal treasures was enhanced by a tradition, that they
were the spoils of Croesus, which had been transported by Cyrus from the
citadel of Sardes. The rapid conquests of Heraclius were suspended
only by the winter season; a motive of prudence, or superstition, <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a>
determined his retreat into the province of Albania, along the shores of
the Caspian; and his tents were most probably pitched in the plains of
Mogan, <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> the favorite encampment of Oriental princes. In the course
of this successful inroad, he signalized the zeal and revenge of a
Christian emperor: at his command, the soldiers extinguished the fire,
and destroyed the temples, of the Magi; the statues of Chosroes, who
aspired to divine honors, were abandoned to the flames; and the ruins of
Thebarma or Ormia, <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a> which had given birth to Zoroaster himself, made
some atonement for the injuries of the holy sepulchre. A purer spirit
of religion was shown in the relief and deliverance of fifty
thousand captives. Heraclius was rewarded by their tears and grateful
acclamations; but this wise measure, which spread the fame of his
benevolence, diffused the murmurs of the Persians against the pride
and obstinacy of their own sovereign.

<h2>
    Chapter XLVI: Troubles In Persia.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
Amidst the glories of the succeeding campaign, Heraclius is almost lost
to our eyes, and to those of the Byzantine historians. <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a> From the
spacious and fruitful plains of Albania, the emperor appears to follow
the chain of Hyrcanian Mountains, to descend into the province of Media
or Irak, and to carry his victorious arms as far as the royal cities
of Casbin and Ispahan, which had never been approached by a Roman
conqueror. Alarmed by the danger of his kingdom, the powers of Chosroes
were already recalled from the Nile and the Bosphorus, and three
formidable armies surrounded, in a distant and hostile land, the camp
of the emperor. The Colchian allies prepared to desert his standard; and
the fears of the bravest veterans were expressed, rather than concealed,
by their desponding silence. "Be not terrified," said the intrepid
Heraclius, "by the multitude of your foes. With the aid of Heaven, one
Roman may triumph over a thousand Barbarians. But if we devote our
lives for the salvation of our brethren, we shall obtain the crown of
martyrdom, and our immortal reward will be liberally paid by God and
posterity." These magnanimous sentiments were supported by the vigor of
his actions. He repelled the threefold attack of the Persians, improved
the divisions of their chiefs, and, by a well-concerted train of
marches, retreats, and successful actions, finally chased them from the
field into the fortified cities of Media and Assyria. In the severity
of the winter season, Sarbaraza deemed himself secure in the walls of
Salban: he was surprised by the activity of Heraclius, who divided his
troops, and performed a laborious march in the silence of the night. The
flat roofs of the houses were defended with useless valor against the
darts and torches of the Romans: the satraps and nobles of Persia, with
their wives and children, and the flower of their martial youth, were
either slain or made prisoners. The general escaped by a precipitate
flight, but his golden armor was the prize of the conqueror; and the
soldiers of Heraclius enjoyed the wealth and repose which they had so
nobly deserved. On the return of spring, the emperor traversed in seven
days the mountains of Curdistan, and passed without resistance the
rapid stream of the Tigris. Oppressed by the weight of their spoils and
captives, the Roman army halted under the walls of Amida; and Heraclius
informed the senate of Constantinople of his safety and success, which
they had already felt by the retreat of the besiegers. The bridges of
the Euphrates were destroyed by the Persians; but as soon as the emperor
had discovered a ford, they hastily retired to defend the banks of the
Sarus, <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> in Cilicia. That river, an impetuous torrent, was about
three hundred feet broad; the bridge was fortified with strong turrets;
and the banks were lined with Barbarian archers. After a bloody
conflict, which continued till the evening, the Romans prevailed in the
assault; and a Persian of gigantic size was slain and thrown into the
Sarus by the hand of the emperor himself. The enemies were dispersed and
dismayed; Heraclius pursued his march to Sebaste in Cappadocia; and at
the expiration of three years, the same coast of the Euxine applauded
his return from a long and victorious expedition. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a>

against the Persians.]
</p>
<p>
Instead of skirmishing on the frontier, the two monarchs who disputed
the empire of the East aimed their desperate strokes at the heart of
their rival. The military force of Persia was wasted by the marches and
combats of twenty years, and many of the veterans, who had survived
the perils of the sword and the climate, were still detained in the
fortresses of Egypt and Syria. But the revenge and ambition of Chosroes
exhausted his kingdom; and the new levies of subjects, strangers, and
slaves, were divided into three formidable bodies. <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> The first army
of fifty thousand men, illustrious by the ornament and title of the
golden spears, was destined to march against Heraclius; the second
was stationed to prevent his junction with the troops of his brother
Theodorus; and the third was commanded to besiege Constantinople, and
to second the operations of the chagan, with whom the Persian king had
ratified a treaty of alliance and partition. Sarbar, the general of the
third army, penetrated through the provinces of Asia to the well-known
camp of Chalcedon, and amused himself with the destruction of the sacred
and profane buildings of the Asiatic suburbs, while he impatiently
waited the arrival of his Scythian friends on the opposite side of the
Bosphorus. On the twenty-ninth of June, thirty thousand Barbarians, the
vanguard of the Avars, forced the long wall, and drove into the capital
a promiscuous crowd of peasants, citizens, and soldiers. Fourscore
thousand <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> of his native subjects, and of the vassal tribes of
Gepidae, Russians, Bulgarians, and Sclavonians, advanced under the
standard of the chagan; a month was spent in marches and negotiations,
but the whole city was invested on the thirty-first of July, from the
suburbs of Pera and Galata to the Blachernae and seven towers; and the
inhabitants descried with terror the flaming signals of the European
and Asiatic shores. In the mean while, the magistrates of Constantinople
repeatedly strove to purchase the retreat of the chagan; but their
deputies were rejected and insulted; and he suffered the patricians to
stand before his throne, while the Persian envoys, in silk robes, were
seated by his side. "You see," said the haughty Barbarian, "the proofs
of my perfect union with the great king; and his lieutenant is ready to
send into my camp a select band of three thousand warriors. Presume no
longer to tempt your master with a partial and inadequate ransom your
wealth and your city are the only presents worthy of my acceptance. For
yourselves, I shall permit you to depart, each with an under-garment and
a shirt; and, at my entreaty, my friend Sarbar will not refuse a passage
through his lines. Your absent prince, even now a captive or a fugitive,
has left Constantinople to its fate; nor can you escape the arms of
the Avars and Persians, unless you could soar into the air like birds,
unless like fishes you could dive into the waves." <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> During ten
successive days, the capital was assaulted by the Avars, who had made
some progress in the science of attack; they advanced to sap or batter
the wall, under the cover of the impenetrable tortoise; their engines
discharged a perpetual volley of stones and darts; and twelve lofty
towers of wood exalted the combatants to the height of the neighboring
ramparts.
</p>
<p>
But the senate and people were animated by the spirit of Heraclius, who
had detached to their relief a body of twelve thousand cuirassiers; the
powers of fire and mechanics were used with superior art and success in
the defence of Constantinople; and the galleys, with two and three ranks
of oars, commanded the Bosphorus, and rendered the Persians the idle
spectators of the defeat of their allies. The Avars were repulsed; a
fleet of Sclavonian canoes was destroyed in the harbor; the vassals
of the chagan threatened to desert, his provisions were exhausted, and
after burning his engines, he gave the signal of a slow and formidable
retreat. The devotion of the Romans ascribed this signal deliverance to
the Virgin Mary; but the mother of Christ would surely have condemned
their inhuman murder of the Persian envoys, who were entitled to the
rights of humanity, if they were not protected by the laws of nations.

</p>
<p>
After the division of his army, Heraclius prudently retired to the banks
of the Phasis, from whence he maintained a defensive war against the
fifty thousand gold spears of Persia. His anxiety was relieved by the
deliverance of Constantinople; his hopes were confirmed by a victory of
his brother Theodorus; and to the hostile league of Chosroes with the
Avars, the Roman emperor opposed the useful and honorable alliance
of the Turks. At his liberal invitation, the horde of Chozars <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a>
transported their tents from the plains of the Volga to the mountains of
Georgia; Heraclius received them in the neighborhood of Teflis, and the
khan with his nobles dismounted from their horses, if we may credit the
Greeks, and fell prostrate on the ground, to adore the purple of the
Caesars. Such voluntary homage and important aid were entitled to the
warmest acknowledgments; and the emperor, taking off his own diadem,
placed it on the head of the Turkish prince, whom he saluted with a
tender embrace and the appellation of son. After a sumptuous banquet, he
presented Ziebel with the plate and ornaments, the gold, the gems, and
the silk, which had been used at the Imperial table, and, with his own
hand, distributed rich jewels and ear-rings to his new allies. In a
secret interview, he produced the portrait of his daughter Eudocia, <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a>
condescended to flatter the Barbarian with the promise of a fair and
august bride; obtained an immediate succor of forty thousand horse, and
negotiated a strong diversion of the Turkish arms on the side of the
Oxus. <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> The Persians, in their turn, retreated with precipitation;
in the camp of Edessa, Heraclius reviewed an army of seventy thousand
Romans and strangers; and some months were successfully employed in
the recovery of the cities of Syria, Mesopotamia and Armenia, whose
fortifications had been imperfectly restored. Sarbar still maintained
the important station of Chalcedon; but the jealousy of Chosroes, or the
artifice of Heraclius, soon alienated the mind of that powerful satrap
from the service of his king and country. A messenger was intercepted
with a real or fictitious mandate to the cadarigan, or second in
command, directing him to send, without delay, to the throne, the head
of a guilty or unfortunate general. The despatches were transmitted to
Sarbar himself; and as soon as he read the sentence of his own death,
he dexterously inserted the names of four hundred officers, assembled
a military council, and asked the cadarigan whether he was prepared to
execute the commands of their tyrant. The Persians unanimously declared,
that Chosroes had forfeited the sceptre; a separate treaty was concluded
with the government of Constantinople; and if some considerations
of honor or policy restrained Sarbar from joining the standard of
Heraclius, the emperor was assured that he might prosecute, without
interruption, his designs of victory and peace.

of a cipher is scarcely enough to restore his sanity]
</p>
<p>
Deprived of his firmest support, and doubtful of the fidelity of his
subjects, the greatness of Chosroes was still conspicuous in its ruins.
The number of five hundred thousand may be interpreted as an Oriental
metaphor, to describe the men and arms, the horses and elephants, that
covered Media and Assyria against the invasion of Heraclius. Yet the
Romans boldly advanced from the Araxes to the Tigris, and the timid
prudence of Rhazates was content to follow them by forced marches
through a desolate country, till he received a peremptory mandate to
risk the fate of Persia in a decisive battle. Eastward of the Tigris,
at the end of the bridge of Mosul, the great Nineveh had formerly been
erected: <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> the city, and even the ruins of the city, had long since
disappeared; <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> the vacant space afforded a spacious field for the
operations of the two armies. But these operations are neglected by the
Byzantine historians, and, like the authors of epic poetry and romance,
they ascribe the victory, not to the military conduct, but to the
personal valor, of their favorite hero. On this memorable day,
Heraclius, on his horse Phallas, surpassed the bravest of his warriors:
his lip was pierced with a spear; the steed was wounded in the thigh;
but he carried his master safe and victorious through the triple phalanx
of the Barbarians. In the heat of the action, three valiant chiefs were
successively slain by the sword and lance of the emperor: among these
was Rhazates himself; he fell like a soldier, but the sight of his head
scattered grief and despair through the fainting ranks of the Persians.
His armor of pure and massy gold, the shield of one hundred and twenty
plates, the sword and belt, the saddle and cuirass, adorned the triumph
of Heraclius; and if he had not been faithful to Christ and his mother,
the champion of Rome might have offered the fourth opime spoils to
the Jupiter of the Capitol. <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> In the battle of Nineveh, which
was fiercely fought from daybreak to the eleventh hour, twenty-eight
standards, besides those which might be broken or torn, were taken from
the Persians; the greatest part of their army was cut in pieces, and the
victors, concealing their own loss, passed the night on the field. They
acknowledged, that on this occasion it was less difficult to kill
than to discomfit the soldiers of Chosroes; amidst the bodies of their
friends, no more than two bow-shot from the enemy the remnant of the
Persian cavalry stood firm till the seventh hour of the night; about
the eighth hour they retired to their unrifled camp, collected their
baggage, and dispersed on all sides, from the want of orders rather than
of resolution. The diligence of Heraclius was not less admirable in
the use of victory; by a march of forty-eight miles in four-and-twenty
hours, his vanguard occupied the bridges of the great and the lesser
Zab; and the cities and palaces of Assyria were open for the first
time to the Romans. By a just gradation of magnificent scenes, they
penetrated to the royal seat of Dastagerd, <a href="#note-1031" name="noteref-1031"><small>1031</small></a> and, though much of
the treasure had been removed, and much had been expended, the remaining
wealth appears to have exceeded their hopes, and even to have satiated
their avarice. Whatever could not be easily transported, they consumed
with fire, that Chosroes might feel the anguish of those wounds which he
had so often inflicted on the provinces of the empire: and justice might
allow the excuse, if the desolation had been confined to the works of
regal luxury, if national hatred, military license, and religious zeal,
had not wasted with equal rage the habitations and the temples of the
guiltless subject. The recovery of three hundred Roman standards, and
the deliverance of the numerous captives of Edessa and Alexandria,
reflect a purer glory on the arms of Heraclius. From the palace
of Dastagerd, he pursued his march within a few miles of Modain or
Ctesiphon, till he was stopped, on the banks of the Arba, by the
difficulty of the passage, the rigor of the season, and perhaps the fame
of an impregnable capital. The return of the emperor is marked by the
modern name of the city of Sherhzour: he fortunately passed Mount
Zara, before the snow, which fell incessantly thirty-four days; and the
citizens of Gandzca, or Tauris, were compelled to entertain the soldiers
and their horses with a hospitable reception. <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a>

<p>
When the ambition of Chosroes was reduced to the defence of his
hereditary kingdom, the love of glory, or even the sense of shame,
should have urged him to meet his rival in the field. In the battle of
Nineveh, his courage might have taught the Persians to vanquish, or
he might have fallen with honor by the lance of a Roman emperor. The
successor of Cyrus chose rather, at a secure distance, to expect the
event, to assemble the relics of the defeat, and to retire, by measured
steps, before the march of Heraclius, till he beheld with a sigh the
once loved mansions of Dastagerd. Both his friends and enemies were
persuaded, that it was the intention of Chosroes to bury himself under
the ruins of the city and palace: and as both might have been equally
adverse to his flight, the monarch of Asia, with Sira, <a href="#note-1041" name="noteref-1041"><small>1041</small></a> and three
concubines, escaped through a hole in the wall nine days before the
arrival of the Romans. The slow and stately procession in which he
showed himself to the prostrate crowd, was changed to a rapid and secret
journey; and the first evening he lodged in the cottage of a peasant,
whose humble door would scarcely give admittance to the great king.
<a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> His superstition was subdued by fear: on the third day, he entered
with joy the fortifications of Ctesiphon; yet he still doubted of
his safety till he had opposed the River Tigris to the pursuit of the
Romans. The discovery of his flight agitated with terror and tumult
the palace, the city, and the camp of Dastagerd: the satraps hesitated
whether they had most to fear from their sovereign or the enemy; and
the females of the harem were astonished and pleased by the sight of
mankind, till the jealous husband of three thousand wives again confined
them to a more distant castle. At his command, the army of Dastagerd
retreated to a new camp: the front was covered by the Arba, and a line
of two hundred elephants; the troops of the more distant provinces
successively arrived, and the vilest domestics of the king and satraps
were enrolled for the last defence of the throne. It was still in the
power of Chosroes to obtain a reasonable peace; and he was repeatedly
pressed by the messengers of Heraclius to spare the blood of his
subjects, and to relieve a humane conqueror from the painful duty of
carrying fire and sword through the fairest countries of Asia. But the
pride of the Persian had not yet sunk to the level of his fortune; he
derived a momentary confidence from the retreat of the emperor; he
wept with impotent rage over the ruins of his Assyrian palaces, and
disregarded too long the rising murmurs of the nation, who complained
that their lives and fortunes were sacrificed to the obstinacy of an old
man. That unhappy old man was himself tortured with the sharpest pains
both of mind and body; and, in the consciousness of his approaching end,
he resolved to fix the tiara on the head of Merdaza, the most favored
of his sons. But the will of Chosroes was no longer revered, and
Siroes, <a href="#note-1051" name="noteref-1051"><small>1051</small></a> who gloried in the rank and merit of his mother Sira, had
conspired with the malecontents to assert and anticipate the rights
of primogeniture. <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> Twenty-two satraps (they styled themselves
patriots) were tempted by the wealth and honors of a new reign: to
the soldiers, the heir of Chosroes promised an increase of pay; to
the Christians, the free exercise of their religion; to the captives,
liberty and rewards; and to the nation, instant peace and the reduction
of taxes. It was determined by the conspirators, that Siroes, with the
ensigns of royalty, should appear in the camp; and if the enterprise
should fail, his escape was contrived to the Imperial court. But the new
monarch was saluted with unanimous acclamations; the flight of Chosroes
(yet where could he have fled?) was rudely arrested, eighteen sons were
massacred <a href="#note-1061" name="noteref-1061"><small>1061</small></a> before his face, and he was thrown into a dungeon,
where he expired on the fifth day. The Greeks and modern Persians
minutely describe how Chosroes was insulted, and famished, and tortured,
by the command of an inhuman son, who so far surpassed the example of
his father: but at the time of his death, what tongue would relate
the story of the parricide? what eye could penetrate into the tower of
darkness? According to the faith and mercy of his Christian enemies, he
sunk without hope into a still deeper abyss; <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a> and it will not be
denied, that tyrants of every age and sect are the best entitled to such
infernal abodes. The glory of the house of Sassan ended with the life of
Chosroes: his unnatural son enjoyed only eight months the fruit of his
crimes: and in the space of four years, the regal title was assumed by
nine candidates, who disputed, with the sword or dagger, the fragments
of an exhausted monarchy. Every province, and each city of Persia, was
the scene of independence, of discord, and of blood; and the state of
anarchy prevailed about eight years longer, <a href="#note-1071" name="noteref-1071"><small>1071</small></a> till the factions
were silenced and united under the common yoke of the Arabian caliphs.

As soon as the mountains became passable, the emperor received the
welcome news of the success of the conspiracy, the death of Chosroes,
and the elevation of his eldest son to the throne of Persia. The authors
of the revolution, eager to display their merits in the court or camp of
Tauris, preceded the ambassadors of Siroes, who delivered the letters
of their master to his brother the emperor of the Romans. <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> In the
language of the usurpers of every age, he imputes his own crimes to the
Deity, and, without degrading his equal majesty, he offers to reconcile
the long discord of the two nations, by a treaty of peace and alliance
more durable than brass or iron. The conditions of the treaty were
easily defined and faithfully executed. In the recovery of the standards
and prisoners which had fallen into the hands of the Persians, the
emperor imitated the example of Augustus: their care of the national
dignity was celebrated by the poets of the times, but the decay of
genius may be measured by the distance between Horace and George of
Pisidia: the subjects and brethren of Heraclius were redeemed from
persecution, slavery, and exile; but, instead of the Roman eagles, the
true wood of the holy cross was restored to the importunate demands of
the successor of Constantine. The victor was not ambitious of enlarging
the weakness of the empire; the son of Chosroes abandoned without regret
the conquests of his father; the Persians who evacuated the cities of
Syria and Egypt were honorably conducted to the frontier, and a war
which had wounded the vitals of the two monarchies, produced no change
in their external and relative situation. The return of Heraclius from
Tauris to Constantinople was a perpetual triumph; and after the exploits
of six glorious campaigns, he peaceably enjoyed the Sabbath of his
toils. After a long impatience, the senate, the clergy, and the people,
went forth to meet their hero, with tears and acclamations, with olive
branches and innumerable lamps; he entered the capital in a chariot
drawn by four elephants; and as soon as the emperor could disengage
himself from the tumult of public joy, he tasted more genuine
satisfaction in the embraces of his mother and his son. <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a>

life of the mother and tenderness of the son are attested by George of
Pisidia, (Bell. Abar. 255, &amp;c., p. 49.) The metaphor of the Sabbath is
used somewhat profanely by these Byzantine Christians.]

The succeeding year was illustrated by a triumph of a very different
kind, the restitution of the true cross to the holy sepulchre. Heraclius
performed in person the pilgrimage of Jerusalem, the identity of the
relic was verified by the discreet patriarch, <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a> and this august
ceremony has been commemorated by the annual festival of the exaltation
of the cross. Before the emperor presumed to tread the consecrated
ground, he was instructed to strip himself of the diadem and purple,
the pomp and vanity of the world: but in the judgment of his clergy, the
persecution of the Jews was more easily reconciled with the precepts
of the gospel. <a href="#note-1113" name="noteref-1113"><small>1113</small></a> He again ascended his throne to receive the
congratulations of the ambassadors of France and India: and the fame
of Moses, Alexander, and Hercules, <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> was eclipsed in the popular
estimation, by the superior merit and glory of the great Heraclius.
Yet the deliverer of the East was indigent and feeble. Of the Persian
spoils, the most valuable portion had been expended in the war,
distributed to the soldiers, or buried, by an unlucky tempest, in the
waves of the Euxine. The conscience of the emperor was oppressed by the
obligation of restoring the wealth of the clergy, which he had borrowed
for their own defence: a perpetual fund was required to satisfy these
inexorable creditors; the provinces, already wasted by the arms and
avarice of the Persians, were compelled to a second payment of the same
taxes; and the arrears of a simple citizen, the treasurer of Damascus,
were commuted to a fine of one hundred thousand pieces of gold. The loss
of two hundred thousand soldiers <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> who had fallen by the sword,
was of less fatal importance than the decay of arts, agriculture, and
population, in this long and destructive war: and although a victorious
army had been formed under the standard of Heraclius, the unnatural
effort appears to have exhausted rather than exercised their strength.
While the emperor triumphed at Constantinople or Jerusalem, an obscure
town on the confines of Syria was pillaged by the Saracens, and they
cut in pieces some troops who advanced to its relief; an ordinary and
trifling occurrence, had it not been the prelude of a mighty revolution.
These robbers were the apostles of Mahomet; their fanatic valor had
emerged from the desert; and in the last eight years of his reign,
Heraclius lost to the Arabs the same provinces which he had rescued from
the Persians.
