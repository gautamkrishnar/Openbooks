Note: In the notes to this important chapter, which is received as
the text-book on Civil Law in some of the foreign universities, I have
consulted,
</p>
<p>
I. the newly-discovered Institutes of Gaius, (Gaii Institutiones, ed.
Goeschen, Berlin, 1824,) with some other fragments of the Roman law,
(Codicis Theodosiani Fragmenta inedita, ab Amadeo Peyron. Turin, 1824.)
</p>
<p>
II. The History of the Roman Law, by Professor Hugo, in the French
translation of M. Jourdan. Paris, 1825.
</p>
<p>
III. Savigny, Geschichte des Romischen Rechts im Mittelalter, 6 bande,
Heidelberg, 1815.
</p>
<p>
IV. Walther, Romische Rechts-Geschichte, Bonn. 1834. But I am
particularly indebted to an edition of the French translation of this
chapter, with additional notes, by one of the most learned civilians of
Europe, Professor Warnkonig, published at Liege, 1821. I have inserted
almost the whole of these notes, which are distinguished by the letter
W.&mdash;M. The vain titles of the victories of Justinian are crumbled
into dust; but the name of the legislator is inscribed on a fair and
everlasting monument. Under his reign, and by his care, the civil
jurisprudence was digested in the immortal works of the Code, the
Pandects, and the Institutes: <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> the public reason of the Romans has
been silently or studiously transfused into the domestic institutions
of Europe, <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a>, and the laws of Justinian still command the respect or
obedience of independent nations. Wise or fortunate is the prince who
connects his own reputation with the honor or interest of a perpetual
order of men. The defence of their founder is the first cause, which
in every age has exercised the zeal and industry of the civilians. They
piously commemorate his virtues; dissemble or deny his failings; and
fiercely chastise the guilt or folly of the rebels, who presume to sully
the majesty of the purple. The idolatry of love has provoked, as it
usually happens, the rancor of opposition; the character of Justinian
has been exposed to the blind vehemence of flattery and invective; and
the injustice of a sect (the Anti-Tribonians,) has refused all praise
and merit to the prince, his ministers, and his laws. <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> Attached to no
party, interested only for the truth and candor of history, and
directed by the most temperate and skilful guides, <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> I enter with
just diffidence on the subject of civil law, which has exhausted so many
learned lives, and clothed the walls of such spacious libraries. In
a single, if possible in a short, chapter, I shall trace the Roman
jurisprudence from Romulus to Justinian, <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> appreciate the labors of
that emperor, and pause to contemplate the principles of a science so
important to the peace and happiness of society. The laws of a nation
form the most instructive portion of its history; and although I have
devoted myself to write the annals of a declining monarchy, I shall
embrace the occasion to breathe the pure and invigorating air of the
republic.

[ The civilians of the darker ages have established an absurd
and incomprehensible mode of quotation, which is supported by authority
and custom. In their references to the Code, the Pandects, and the
Institutes, they mention the number, not of the book, but only of the
law; and content themselves with reciting the first words of the title
to which it belongs; and of these titles there are more than a thousand.
Ludewig (Vit. Justiniani, p. 268) wishes to shake off this pendantic
yoke; and I have dared to adopt the simple and rational method of
numbering the book, the title, and the law. Note: The example of Gibbon
has been followed by M Hugo and other civilians.&mdash;M]

[ Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, Poland, and Scotland, have
received them as common law or reason; in France, Italy, &amp;c., they
possess a direct or indirect influence; and they were respected in
England, from Stephen to Edward I. our national Justinian, (Duck. de
Usu et Auctoritate Juris Civilis, l. ii. c. 1, 8&mdash;15. Heineccius, Hist.
Juris Germanici, c. 3, 4, No. 55-124, and the legal historians of each
country.) * Note: Although the restoration of the Roman law, introduced
by the revival of this study in Italy, is one of the most important
branches of history, it had been treated but imperfectly when Gibbon
wrote his work. That of Arthur Duck is but an insignificant performance.
But the researches of the learned have thrown much light upon the
matter. The Sarti, the Tiraboschi, the Fantuzzi, the Savioli, had made
some very interesting inquiries; but it was reserved for M. de Savigny,
in a work entitled "The History of the Roman Law during the Middle
Ages," to cast the strongest right on this part of history. He
demonstrates incontestably the preservation of the Roman law from
Justinian to the time of the Glossators, who by their indefatigable
zeal, propagated the study of the Roman jurisprudence in all the
countries of Europe. It is much to be desired that the author should
continue this interesting work, and that the learned should engage in
the inquiry in what manner the Roman law introduced itself into their
respective countries, and the authority which it progressively acquired.
For Belgium, there exists, on this subject, (proposed by the Academy of
Brussels in 1781,) a Collection of Memoirs, printed at Brussels in
4to., 1783, among which should be distinguished those of M. de Berg. M.
Berriat Saint Prix has given us hopes of the speedy appearance of a
work in which he will discuss this question, especially in relation to
France. M. Spangenberg, in his Introduction to the Study of the Corpus
Juris Civilis Hanover, 1817, 1 vol. 8vo. p. 86, 116, gives us a general
sketch of the history of the Roman law in different parts of Europe.
We cannot avoid mentioning an elementary work by M. Hugo, in which he
treats of the History of the Roman Law from Justinian to the present
Time, 2d edit. Berlin 1818 W.]

[ Francis Hottoman, a learned and acute lawyer of the xvith
century, wished to mortify Cujacius, and to please the Chancellor
de l'Hopital. His Anti-Tribonianus (which I have never been able to
procure) was published in French in 1609; and his sect was propagated in
Germany, (Heineccius, Op. tom. iii. sylloge iii. p. 171&mdash;183.) * Note:
Though there have always been many detractors of the Roman law, no sect
of Anti-Tribonians has ever existed under that name, as Gibbon seems to
suppose.&mdash;W.]

[ At the head of these guides I shall respectfully place
the learned and perspicuous Heineccius, a German professor, who died
at Halle in the year 1741, (see his Eloge in the Nouvelle Bibliotheque
Germanique, tom. ii. p. 51&mdash;64.) His ample works have been collected
in eight volumes in 4to. Geneva, 1743-1748. The treatises which I have
separately used are, 1. Historia Juris Romani et Germanici, Lugd.
Batav. 1740, in 8 vo. 2. Syntagma Antiquitatum Romanam Jurisprudentiam
illustrantium, 2 vols. in 8 vo. Traject. ad Rhenum. 3. Elementa Juris
Civilis secundum Ordinem Institutionum, Lugd. Bat. 1751, in 8 vo. 4.
Elementa J. C. secundum Ordinem Pandectarum Traject. 1772, in 8vo. 2
vols. * Note: Our author, who was not a lawyer, was necessarily obliged
to content himself with following the opinions of those writers who were
then of the greatest authority; but as Heineccius, notwithstanding his
high reputation for the study of the Roman law, knew nothing of
the subject on which he treated, but what he had learned from the
compilations of various authors, it happened that, in following the
sometimes rash opinions of these guides, Gibbon has fallen into many
errors, which we shall endeavor in succession to correct. The work of
Bach on the History of the Roman Jurisprudence, with which Gibbon was
not acquainted, is far superior to that of Heineccius and since that
time we have new obligations to the modern historic civilians, whose
indefatigable researches have greatly enlarged the sphere of our
knowledge in this important branch of history. We want a pen like that
of Gibbon to give to the more accurate notions which we have acquired
since his time, the brilliancy, the vigor, and the animation
which Gibbon has bestowed on the opinions of Heineccius and his
contemporaries.&mdash;W]

[ Our original text is a fragment de Origine Juris (Pandect.
l. i. tit. ii.) of Pomponius, a Roman lawyer, who lived under the
Antonines, (Heinecc. tom. iii. syl. iii. p. 66&mdash;126.) It has been
abridged, and probably corrupted, by Tribonian, and since restored by
Bynkershoek (Opp. tom. i. p. 279&mdash;304.)]
</p>
<p>
The primitive government of Rome <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> was composed, with some political
skill, of an elective king, a council of nobles, and a general assembly
of the people. War and religion were administered by the supreme
magistrate; and he alone proposed the laws, which were debated in the
senate, and finally ratified or rejected by a majority of votes in
the thirty curiae or parishes of the city. Romulus, Numa, and Servius
Tullius, are celebrated as the most ancient legislators; and each
of them claims his peculiar part in the threefold division of
jurisprudence. <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> The laws of marriage, the education of children,
and the authority of parents, which may seem to draw their origin from
nature itself, are ascribed to the untutored wisdom of Romulus. The law
of nations and of religious worship, which Numa introduced, was derived
from his nocturnal converse with the nymph Egeria. The civil law is
attributed to the experience of Servius: he balanced the rights and
fortunes of the seven classes of citizens; and guarded, by fifty new
regulations, the observance of contracts and the punishment of crimes.
The state, which he had inclined towards a democracy, was changed by the
last Tarquin into a lawless despotism; and when the kingly office was
abolished, the patricians engrossed the benefits of freedom. The royal
laws became odious or obsolete; the mysterious deposit was silently
preserved by the priests and nobles; and at the end of sixty years, the
citizens of Rome still complained that they were ruled by the arbitrary
sentence of the magistrates. Yet the positive institutions of the kings
had blended themselves with the public and private manners of the city,
some fragments of that venerable jurisprudence <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> were compiled by the
diligence of antiquarians, <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> and above twenty texts still speak the
rudeness of the Pelasgic idiom of the Latins. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a>

[ The constitutional history of the kings of Rome may be
studied in the first book of Livy, and more copiously in Dionysius
Halicarnassensis, (l. li. p. 80&mdash;96, 119&mdash;130, l. iv. p. 198&mdash;220,) who
sometimes betrays the character of a rhetorician and a Greek. * Note: M.
Warnkonig refers to the work of Beaufort, on the Uncertainty of the
Five First Ages of the Roman History, with which Gibbon was probably
acquainted, to Niebuhr, and to the less known volume of Wachsmuth,
"Aeltere Geschichte des Rom. Staats." To these I would add A. W.
Schlegel's Review of Niebuhr, and my friend Dr. Arnold's recently
published volume, of which the chapter on the Law of the XII. Tables
appears to me one of the most valuable, if not the most valuable,
chapter.&mdash;M.]

[ This threefold division of the law was applied to the three
Roman kings by Justus Lipsius, (Opp. tom. iv. p. 279;) is adopted by
Gravina, (Origines Juris Civilis, p. 28, edit. Lips. 1737:) and is
reluctantly admitted by Mascou, his German editor. * Note: Whoever is
acquainted with the real notions of the Romans on the jus naturale,
gentium et civile, cannot but disapprove of this explanation which
has no relation to them, and might be taken for a pleasantry. It is
certainly unnecessary to increase the confusion which already prevails
among modern writers on the true sense of these ideas. Hugo.&mdash;W]

[ The most ancient Code or Digest was styled Jus Papirianum,
from the first compiler, Papirius, who flourished somewhat before
or after the Regifugium, (Pandect. l. i. tit. ii.) The best judicial
critics, even Bynkershoek (tom. i. p. 284, 285) and Heineccius, (Hist.
J. C. R. l. i. c. 16, 17, and Opp. tom. iii. sylloge iv. p. 1&mdash;8,) give
credit to this tale of Pomponius, without sufficiently adverting to
the value and rarity of such a monument of the third century, of the
illiterate city. I much suspect that the Caius Papirius, the Pontifex
Maximus, who revived the laws of Numa (Dionys. Hal. l. iii. p. 171) left
only an oral tradition; and that the Jus Papirianum of Granius Flaccus
(Pandect. l. L. tit. xvi. leg. 144) was not a commentary, but an
original work, compiled in the time of Caesar, (Censorin. de Die
Natali, l. iii. p. 13, Duker de Latinitate J. C. p. 154.) Note: Niebuhr
considers the Jus Papirianum, adduced by Verrius Fiaccus, to be of
undoubted authenticity. Rom. Geschichte, l. 257.&mdash;M. Compare this with
the work of M. Hugo.&mdash;W.]

[ In the year 1444, seven or eight tables of brass were dug
up between Cortona and Gubio. A part of these (for the rest is Etruscan)
represents the primitive state of the Pelasgic letters and language,
which are ascribed by Herodotus to that district of Italy, (l. i. c. 56,
57, 58;) though this difficult passage may be explained of a Crestona in
Thrace, (Notes de Larcher, tom. i. p. 256&mdash;261.) The savage dialect
of the Eugubine tables  has exercised, and may still elude, the
divination of criticism; but the root is undoubtedly Latin, of the same
age and character as the Saliare Carmen, which, in the time of Horace,
none could understand. The Roman idiom, by an infusion of Doric and
Aeolic Greek, was gradually ripened into the style of the xii. tables,
of the Duillian column, of Ennius, of Terence, and of Cicero, (Gruter.
Inscript. tom. i. p. cxlii. Scipion Maffei, Istoria Diplomatica, p.
241&mdash;258. Bibliotheque Italique, tom. iii. p. 30&mdash;41, 174&mdash;205. tom.
xiv. p. 1&mdash;52.) * Note: The Eugubine Tables have exercised the ingenuity
of the Italian and German critics; it seems admitted (O. Muller,
die Etrusker, ii. 313) that they are Tuscan. See the works of Lanzi,
Passeri, Dempster, and O. Muller.&mdash;M]
</p>
<p>
I shall not repeat the well-known story of the Decemvirs, <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> who
sullied by their actions the honor of inscribing on brass, or wood, or
ivory, the Twelve Tables of the Roman laws. <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> They were dictated by
the rigid and jealous spirit of an aristocracy, which had yielded with
reluctance to the just demands of the people. But the substance of the
Twelve Tables was adapted to the state of the city; and the Romans
had emerged from Barbarism, since they were capable of studying and
embracing the institutions of their more enlightened neighbors. <a href="#note-1211" name="noteref-1211"><small>1211</small></a>
A wise Ephesian was driven by envy from his native country: before he
could reach the shores of Latium, he had observed the various forms
of human nature and civil society: he imparted his knowledge to the
legislators of Rome, and a statue was erected in the forum to the
perpetual memory of Hermodorus. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> The names and divisions of the
copper money, the sole coin of the infant state, were of Dorian origin:
<a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> the harvests of Campania and Sicily relieved the wants of a people
whose agriculture was often interrupted by war and faction; and since
the trade was established, <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> the deputies who sailed from the
Tyber might return from the same harbors with a more precious cargo
of political wisdom. The colonies of Great Greece had transported and
improved the arts of their mother country. Cumae and Rhegium, Crotona
and Tarentum, Agrigentum and Syracuse, were in the rank of the most
flourishing cities. The disciples of Pythagoras applied philosophy to
the use of government; the unwritten laws of Charondas accepted the
aid of poetry and music, <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> and Zaleucus framed the republic of the
Locrians, which stood without alteration above two hundred years. <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a>
From a similar motive of national pride, both Livy and Dionysius are
willing to believe, that the deputies of Rome visited Athens under the
wise and splendid administration of Pericles; and the laws of Solon were
transfused into the twelve tables. If such an embassy had indeed been
received from the Barbarians of Hesperia, the Roman name would have
been familiar to the Greeks before the reign of Alexander; <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> and
the faintest evidence would have been explored and celebrated by the
curiosity of succeeding times. But the Athenian monuments are silent;
nor will it seem credible that the patricians should undertake a long
and perilous navigation to copy the purest model of democracy. In the
comparison of the tables of Solon with those of the Decemvirs, some
casual resemblance may be found; some rules which nature and reason have
revealed to every society; some proofs of a common descent from Egypt
or Phoenicia. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> But in all the great lines of public and private
jurisprudence, the legislators of Rome and Athens appear to be strangers
or adverse at each other.

(Bynkershoek, p. 286.) Wood, brass, and ivory, might be successively

important question whether the twelve tables in fact include laws
imported from Greece. The negative opinion maintained by our author, is
now almost universally adopted, particularly by Mm. Niebuhr, Hugo, and
others. See my Institutiones Juris Romani privati Leodii, 1819, p. 311,
312.&mdash;W. Dr. Arnold, p. 255, seems to incline to the opposite opinion.

Hermodorus had some share in framing the Laws of the Twelve Tables.
Pomponius even says that this Hermodorus was the author of the last two
tables. Pliny calls him the Interpreter of the Decemvirs, which may lead
us to suppose that he labored with them in drawing up that law. But
it is astonishing that in his Dissertation, (De Hermodoro vero XII.
Tabularum Auctore, Annales Academiae Groninganae anni 1817, 1818,) M.
Gratama has ventured to advance two propositions entirely devoid of
proof: "Decem priores tabulas ab ipsis Romanis non esse profectas, tota
confirma Decemviratus Historia," et "Hermodorum legum decemviralium ceri
nominis auctorem esse, qui eas composuerit suis ordinibus, disposuerit,
suaque fecerit auctoritate, ut a decemviris reciperentur." This truly
was an age in which the Roman Patricians would allow their laws to be
dictated by a foreign Exile! Mr. Gratama does not attempt to prove the
authenticity of the supposititious letter of Heraclitus. He contents
himself with expressing his astonishment that M. Bonamy (as well as
Gibbon) will be receive it as genuine.&mdash;W.]

    Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
Whatever might be the origin or the merit of the twelve tables, <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a>
they obtained among the Romans that blind and partial reverence which
the lawyers of every country delight to bestow on their municipal
institutions. The study is recommended by Cicero <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> as equally
pleasant and instructive. "They amuse the mind by the remembrance of old
words and the portrait of ancient manners; they inculcate the soundest
principles of government and morals; and I am not afraid to affirm, that
the brief composition of the Decemvirs surpasses in genuine value the
libraries of Grecian philosophy. How admirable," says Tully, with honest
or affected prejudice, "is the wisdom of our ancestors! We alone are the
masters of civil prudence, and our superiority is the more conspicuous,
if we deign to cast our eyes on the rude and almost ridiculous
jurisprudence of Draco, of Solon, and of Lycurgus." The twelve tables
were committed to the memory of the young and the meditation of the old;
they were transcribed and illustrated with learned diligence; they had
escaped the flames of the Gauls, they subsisted in the age of Justinian,
and their subsequent loss has been imperfectly restored by the labors
of modern critics. <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> But although these venerable monuments were
considered as the rule of right and the fountain of justice, <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> they
were overwhelmed by the weight and variety of new laws, which, at the
end of five centuries, became a grievance more intolerable than the
vices of the city. <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> Three thousand brass plates, the acts of the
senate of the people, were deposited in the Capitol: <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> and some of
the acts, as the Julian law against extortion, surpassed the number of
a hundred chapters. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> The Decemvirs had neglected to import the
sanction of Zaleucus, which so long maintained the integrity of his
republic. A Locrian, who proposed any new law, stood forth in the
assembly of the people with a cord round his neck, and if the law was
rejected, the innovator was instantly strangled.

<p>
The Decemvirs had been named, and their tables were approved, by
an assembly of the centuries, in which riches preponderated against
numbers. To the first class of Romans, the proprietors of one hundred
thousand pounds of copper, <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> ninety-eight votes were assigned, and
only ninety-five were left for the six inferior classes, distributed
according to their substance by the artful policy of Servius. But the
tribunes soon established a more specious and popular maxim, that every
citizen has an equal right to enact the laws which he is bound to obey.
Instead of the centuries, they convened the tribes; and the patricians,
after an impotent struggle, submitted to the decrees of an assembly, in
which their votes were confounded with those of the meanest plebeians.
Yet as long as the tribes successively passed over narrow bridges <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a>
and gave their voices aloud, the conduct of each citizen was exposed to
the eyes and ears of his friends and countrymen. The insolvent debtor
consulted the wishes of his creditor; the client would have blushed
to oppose the views of his patron; the general was followed by his
veterans, and the aspect of a grave magistrate was a living lesson to
the multitude. A new method of secret ballot abolished the influence
of fear and shame, of honor and interest, and the abuse of freedom
accelerated the progress of anarchy and despotism. <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> The Romans had
aspired to be equal; they were levelled by the equality of servitude;
and the dictates of Augustus were patiently ratified by the formal
consent of the tribes or centuries. Once, and once only, he experienced
a sincere and strenuous opposition. His subjects had resigned all
political liberty; they defended the freedom of domestic life. A law
which enforced the obligation, and strengthened the bonds of marriage,
was clamorously rejected; Propertius, in the arms of Delia, applauded
the victory of licentious love; and the project of reform was suspended
till a new and more tractable generation had arisen in the world. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a>
Such an example was not necessary to instruct a prudent usurper of the
mischief of popular assemblies; and their abolition, which Augustus
had silently prepared, was accomplished without resistance, and almost
without notice, on the accession of his successor. <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> Sixty thousand
plebeian legislators, whom numbers made formidable, and poverty secure,
were supplanted by six hundred senators, who held their honors, their
fortunes, and their lives, by the clemency of the emperor. The loss of
executive power was alleviated by the gift of legislative authority; and
Ulpian might assert, after the practice of two hundred years, that the
decrees of the senate obtained the force and validity of laws. In the
times of freedom, the resolves of the people had often been dictated by
the passion or error of the moment: the Cornelian, Pompeian, and Julian
laws were adapted by a single hand to the prevailing disorders; but the
senate, under the reign of the Caesars, was composed of magistrates and
lawyers, and in questions of private jurisprudence, the integrity of
their judgment was seldom perverted by fear or interest. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a>

100,000 asses by 10,000 Attic drachmae, or somewhat more than 300 pounds
sterling. But their calculation can apply only to the latter times, when
the as was diminished to 1-24th of its ancient weight: nor can I believe
that in the first ages, however destitute of the precious metals, a
single ounce of silver could have been exchanged for seventy pounds
of copper or brass. A more simple and rational method is to value the
copper itself according to the present rate, and, after comparing
the mint and the market price, the Roman and avoirdupois weight, the
primitive as or Roman pound of copper may be appreciated at one English
shilling, and the 100,000 asses of the first class amounted to 5000
pounds sterling. It will appear from the same reckoning, that an ox was
sold at Rome for five pounds, a sheep for ten shillings, and a quarter
of wheat for one pound ten shillings, (Festus, p. 330, edit. Dacier.

senatus-consulta relating to civil rights have been preserved, which are
much earlier than the reigns of Augustus or Tiberius. It is true that,
under the emperors, the senate exercised this right more frequently, and
that the assemblies of the people had become much more rare, though in
law they were still permitted, in the time of Ulpian. (See the fragments
of Ulpian.) Bach has clearly demonstrated that the senate had the
same power in the time of the Republic. It is natural that the
senatus-consulta should have been more frequent under the emperors,
because they employed those means of flattering the pride of the
senators, by granting them the right of deliberating on all affairs

The silence or ambiguity of the laws was supplied by the occasional
edicts <a href="#note-3211" name="noteref-3211"><small>3211</small></a> of those magistrates who were invested with the honors
of the state. <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> This ancient prerogative of the Roman kings was
transferred, in their respective offices, to the consuls and dictators,
the censors and praetors; and a similar right was assumed by the
tribunes of the people, the ediles, and the proconsuls. At Rome, and
in the provinces, the duties of the subject, and the intentions of the
governor, were proclaimed; and the civil jurisprudence was reformed by
the annual edicts of the supreme judge, the praetor of the city. <a href="#note-3311" name="noteref-3311"><small>3311</small></a>
As soon as he ascended his tribunal, he announced by the voice of the
crier, and afterwards inscribed on a white wall, the rules which he
proposed to follow in the decision of doubtful cases, and the relief
which his equity would afford from the precise rigor of ancient
statutes. A principle of discretion more congenial to monarchy was
introduced into the republic: the art of respecting the name, and
eluding the efficacy, of the laws, was improved by successive praetors;
subtleties and fictions were invented to defeat the plainest meaning of
the Decemvirs, and where the end was salutary, the means were frequently
absurd. The secret or probable wish of the dead was suffered to prevail
over the order of succession and the forms of testaments; and the
claimant, who was excluded from the character of heir, accepted with
equal pleasure from an indulgent praetor the possession of the goods
of his late kinsman or benefactor. In the redress of private wrongs,
compensations and fines were substituted to the obsolete rigor of the
Twelve Tables; time and space were annihilated by fanciful suppositions;
and the plea of youth, or fraud, or violence, annulled the obligation,
or excused the performance, of an inconvenient contract. A jurisdiction
thus vague and arbitrary was exposed to the most dangerous abuse: the
substance, as well as the form, of justice were often sacrificed to the
prejudices of virtue, the bias of laudable affection, and the grosser
seductions of interest or resentment. But the errors or vices of each
praetor expired with his annual office; such maxims alone as had been
approved by reason and practice were copied by succeeding judges; the
rule of proceeding was defined by the solution of new cases; and the
temptations of injustice were removed by the Cornelian law, which
compelled the praetor of the year to adhere to the spirit and letter
of his first proclamation. <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> It was reserved for the curiosity and
learning of Adrian, to accomplish the design which had been conceived by
the genius of Caesar; and the praetorship of Salvius Julian, an eminent
lawyer, was immortalized by the composition of the Perpetual Edict. This
well-digested code was ratified by the emperor and the senate; the long
divorce of law and equity was at length reconciled; and, instead of the
Twelve Tables, the perpetual edict was fixed as the invariable standard
of civil jurisprudence. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a>

[ The jus honorarium of the praetors and other magistrates
is strictly defined in the Latin text to the Institutes, (l. i. tit.
ii. No. 7,) and more loosely explained in the Greek paraphrase of
Theophilus, (p. 33&mdash;38, edit. Reitz,) who drops the important word
honorarium. * Note: The author here follows the opinion of Heineccius,
who, according to the idea of his master Thomasius, was unwilling
to suppose that magistrates exercising a judicial could share in the
legislative power. For this reason he represents the edicts of the
praetors as absurd. (See his work, Historia Juris Romani, 69, 74.) But
Heineccius had altogether a false notion of this important institution
of the Romans, to which we owe in a great degree the perfection of their
jurisprudence. Heineccius, therefore, in his own days had many opponents
of his system, among others the celebrated Ritter, professor at
Wittemberg, who contested it in notes appended to the work of
Heineccius, and retained in all subsequent editions of that book.
After Ritter, the learned Bach undertook to vindicate the edicts of the
praetors in his Historia Jurisprud. Rom. edit. 6, p. 218, 224. But it
remained for a civilian of our own days to throw light on the spirit and
true character of this institution. M. Hugo has completely demonstrated
that the praetorian edicts furnished the salutary means of perpetually
harmonizing the legislation with the spirit of the times. The praetors
were the true organs of public opinion. It was not according to their
caprice that they framed their regulations, but according to the manners
and to the opinions of the great civil lawyers of their day. We know
from Cicero himself, that it was esteemed a great honor among the
Romans to publish an edict, well conceived and well drawn. The most
distinguished lawyers of Rome were invited by the praetor to assist in
framing this annual law, which, according to its principle, was only a
declaration which the praetor made to the public, to announce the
manner in which he would judge, and to guard against every charge of
partiality. Those who had reason to fear his opinions might delay their
cause till the following year. The praetor was responsible for all
the faults which he committed. The tribunes could lodge an accusation
against the praetor who issued a partial edict. He was bound strictly
to follow and to observe the regulations published by him at the
commencement of his year of office, according to the Cornelian law, by
which these edicts were called perpetual, and he could make no change
in a regulation once published. The praetor was obliged to submit to
his own edict, and to judge his own affairs according to its provisions.
These magistrates had no power of departing from the fundamental
laws, or the laws of the Twelve Tables. The people held them in
such consideration, that they rarely enacted laws contrary to their
provisions; but as some provisions were found inefficient, others
opposed to the manners of the people, and to the spirit of subsequent
ages, the praetors, still maintaining respect for the laws, endeavored
to bring them into accordance with the necessities of the existing
time, by such fictions as best suited the nature of the case. In what
legislation do we not find these fictions, which even yet exist, absurd
and ridiculous as they are, among the ancient laws of modern nations?
These always variable edicts at length comprehended the whole of the
Roman legislature, and became the subject of the commentaries of the
most celebrated lawyers. They must therefore be considered as the basis
of all the Roman jurisprudence comprehended in the Digest of Justinian.
&mdash;&mdash;It is in this sense that M. Schrader has written on this important
institution, proposing it for imitation as far as may be consistent with
our manners, and agreeable to our political institutions, in order to
avoid immature legislation becoming a permanent evil. See the History of
the Roman Law by M. Hugo, vol. i. p. 296, &amp;c., vol. ii. p. 30, et seq.,
78. et seq., and the note in my elementary book on the Industries, p.
313. With regard to the works best suited to give information on
the framing and the form of these edicts, see Haubold, Institutiones
Literariae, tom. i. p. 321, 368. All that Heineccius says about the
usurpation of the right of making these edicts by the praetors is false,
and contrary to all historical testimony. A multitude of authorities
proves that the magistrates were under an obligation to publish these
edicts.&mdash;W. &mdash;&mdash;With the utmost deference for these excellent civilians,
I cannot but consider this confusion of the judicial and legislative
authority as a very perilous constitutional precedent. It might answer
among a people so singularly trained as the Romans were by habit and
national character in reverence for legal institutions, so as to be an
aristocracy, if not a people, of legislators; but in most nations the
investiture of a magistrate in such authority, leaving to his sole
judgment the lawyers he might consult, and the view of public opinion
which he might take, would be a very insufficient guaranty for right
legislation.&mdash;M.]

[ The history of edicts is composed, and the text of the
perpetual edict is restored, by the master-hand of Heineccius, (Opp.
tom. vii. P. ii. p. 1&mdash;564;) in whose researches I might safely
acquiesce. In the Academy of Inscriptions, M. Bouchaud has given a
series of memoirs to this interesting subject of law and literature. *
Note: This restoration was only the commencement of a work found among
the papers of Heineccius, and published after his death.&mdash;G. &mdash;&mdash;Note:
Gibbon has here fallen into an error, with Heineccius, and almost the
whole literary world, concerning the real meaning of what is called the
perpetual edict of Hadrian. Since the Cornelian law, the edicts were
perpetual, but only in this sense, that the praetor could not change
them during the year of his magistracy. And although it appears that
under Hadrian, the civilian Julianus made, or assisted in making,
a complete collection of the edicts, (which certainly had been done
likewise before Hadrian, for example, by Ofilius, qui diligenter edictum
composuit,) we have no sufficient proof to admit the common opinion,
that the Praetorian edict was declared perpetually unalterable by
Hadrian. The writers on law subsequent to Hadrian (and among the rest
Pomponius, in his Summary of the Roman Jurisprudence) speak of the
edict as it existed in the time of Cicero. They would not certainly
have passed over in silence so remarkable a change in the most important
source of the civil law. M. Hugo has conclusively shown that the various
passages in authors, like Eutropius, are not sufficient to establish the
opinion introduced by Heineccius. Compare Hugo, vol. ii. p. 78. A new
proof of this is found in the Institutes of Gaius, who, in the first
books of his work, expresses himself in the same manner, without
mentioning any change made by Hadrian. Nevertheless, if it had taken
place, he must have noticed it, as he does l. i. 8, the responsa
prudentum, on the occasion of a rescript of Hadrian. There is no lacuna
in the text. Why then should Gaius maintain silence concerning an
innovation so much more important than that of which he speaks? After
all, this question becomes of slight interest, since, in fact, we find
no change in the perpetual edict inserted in the Digest, from the
time of Hadrian to the end of that epoch, except that made by Julian,
(compare Hugo, l. c.) The latter lawyers appear to follow, in their
commentaries, the same texts as their predecessors. It is natural
to suppose, that, after the labors of so many men distinguished
in jurisprudence, the framing of the edict must have attained
such perfection that it would have been difficult to have made any
innovation. We nowhere find that the jurists of the Pandects disputed
concerning the words, or the drawing up of the edict. What difference
would, in fact, result from this with regard to our codes, and our
modern legislation? Compare the learned Dissertation of M. Biener, De
Salvii Juliani meritis in Edictum Praetorium recte aestimandis. Lipsae,
1809, 4to.&mdash;W.]
</p>
<p>
From Augustus to Trajan, the modest Caesars were content to promulgate
their edicts in the various characters of a Roman magistrate; <a href="#note-3511" name="noteref-3511"><small>3511</small></a>
and, in the decrees of the senate, the epistles and orations of the
prince were respectfully inserted. Adrian <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> appears to have been the
first who assumed, without disguise, the plenitude of legislative power.
And this innovation, so agreeable to his active mind, was countenanced
by the patience of the times, and his long absence from the seat of
government. The same policy was embraced by succeeding monarchs, and,
according to the harsh metaphor of Tertullian, "the gloomy and intricate
forest of ancient laws was cleared away by the axe of royal mandates and
constitutions." <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> During four centuries, from Adrian to Justinian
the public and private jurisprudence was moulded by the will of the
sovereign; and few institutions, either human or divine, were permitted
to stand on their former basis. The origin of Imperial legislation was
concealed by the darkness of ages and the terrors of armed despotism;
and a double tiction was propagated by the servility, or perhaps the
ignorance, of the civilians, who basked in the sunshine of the Roman and
Byzantine courts. 1. To the prayer of the ancient Caesars, the people
or the senate had sometimes granted a personal exemption from the
obligation and penalty of particular statutes; and each indulgence was
an act of jurisdiction exercised by the republic over the first of
her citizens. His humble privilege was at length transformed into the
prerogative of a tyrant; and the Latin expression of "released from the
laws" <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> was supposed to exalt the emperor above all human restraints,
and to leave his conscience and reason as the sacred measure of his
conduct. 2. A similar dependence was implied in the decrees of the
senate, which, in every reign, defined the titles and powers of an
elective magistrate. But it was not before the ideas, and even the
language, of the Romans had been corrupted, that a royal law, <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> and
an irrevocable gift of the people, were created by the fancy of Ulpian,
or more probably of Tribonian himself; <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> and the origin of Imperial
power, though false in fact, and slavish in its consequence, was
supported on a principle of freedom and justice. "The pleasure of the
emperor has the vigor and effect of law, since the Roman people, by the
royal law, have transferred to their prince the full extent of their
own power and sovereignty." <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> The will of a single man, of a
child perhaps, was allowed to prevail over the wisdom of ages and
the inclinations of millions; and the degenerate Greeks were proud to
declare, that in his hands alone the arbitrary exercise of legislation
could be safely deposited. "What interest or passion," exclaims
Theophilus in the court of Justinian, "can reach the calm and sublime
elevation of the monarch? He is already master of the lives and fortunes
of his subjects; and those who have incurred his displeasure are already
numbered with the dead." <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> Disdaining the language of flattery, the
historian may confess, that in questions of private jurisprudence, the
absolute sovereign of a great empire can seldom be influenced by any
personal considerations. Virtue, or even reason, will suggest to his
impartial mind, that he is the guardian of peace and equity, and that
the interest of society is inseparably connected with his own. Under the
weakest and most vicious reign, the seat of justice was filled by
the wisdom and integrity of Papinian and Ulpian; <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> and the purest
materials of the Code and Pandects are inscribed with the names of
Caracalla and his ministers. <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> The tyrant of Rome was sometimes the
benefactor of the provinces. A dagger terminated the crimes of Domitian;
but the prudence of Nerva confirmed his acts, which, in the joy of their
deliverance, had been rescinded by an indignant senate. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> Yet in the
rescripts, <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> replies to the consultations of the magistrates, the
wisest of princes might be deceived by a partial exposition of the case.
And this abuse, which placed their hasty decisions on the same level
with mature and deliberate acts of legislation, was ineffectually
condemned by the sense and example of Trajan. The rescripts of the
emperor, his grants and decrees, his edicts and pragmatic sanctions,
were subscribed in purple ink, <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> and transmitted to the provinces as
general or special laws, which the magistrates were bound to execute,
and the people to obey. But as their number continually multiplied, the
rule of obedience became each day more doubtful and obscure, till the
will of the sovereign was fixed and ascertained in the Gregorian, the
Hermogenian, and the Theodosian codes. <a href="#note-4711" name="noteref-4711"><small>4711</small></a> The two first, of which
some fragments have escaped, were framed by two private lawyers,
to preserve the constitutions of the Pagan emperors from Adrian to
Constantine. The third, which is still extant, was digested in sixteen
books by the order of the younger Theodosius to consecrate the laws of
the Christian princes from Constantine to his own reign. But the three
codes obtained an equal authority in the tribunals; and any act which
was not included in the sacred deposit might be disregarded by the judge
as epurious or obsolete. <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a>

    Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
Among savage nations, the want of letters is imperfectly supplied by
the use of visible signs, which awaken attention, and perpetuate the
remembrance of any public or private transaction. The jurisprudence of
the first Romans exhibited the scenes of a pantomime; the words were
adapted to the gestures, and the slightest error or neglect in the
forms of proceeding was sufficient to annul the substance of the fairest
claim. The communion of the marriage-life was denoted by the necessary
elements of fire and water; <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> and the divorced wife resigned the
bunch of keys, by the delivery of which she had been invested with the
government of the family. The manumission of a son, or a slave, was
performed by turning him round with a gentle blow on the cheek; a work
was prohibited by the casting of a stone; prescription was interrupted
by the breaking of a branch; the clinched fist was the symbol of a
pledge or deposit; the right hand was the gift of faith and confidence.
The indenture of covenants was a broken straw; weights and scales were
introduced into every payment, and the heir who accepted a testament was
sometimes obliged to snap his fingers, to cast away his garments, and to
leap or dance with real or affected transport. <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> If a citizen pursued
any stolen goods into a neighbor's house, he concealed his nakedness
with a linen towel, and hid his face with a mask or basin, lest he
should encounter the eyes of a virgin or a matron. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> In a civil
action the plaintiff touched the ear of his witness, seized his
reluctant adversary by the neck, and implored, in solemn lamentation,
the aid of his fellow-citizens. The two competitors grasped each other's
hand as if they stood prepared for combat before the tribunal of the
praetor; he commanded them to produce the object of the dispute; they
went, they returned with measured steps, and a clod of earth was cast
at his feet to represent the field for which they contended. This occult
science of the words and actions of law was the inheritance of the
pontiffs and patricians. Like the Chaldean astrologers, they announced
to their clients the days of business and repose; these important
trifles were interwoven with the religion of Numa; and after the
publication of the Twelve Tables, the Roman people was still enslaved
by the ignorance of judicial proceedings. The treachery of some
plebeian officers at length revealed the profitable mystery: in a more
enlightened age, the legal actions were derided and observed; and the
same antiquity which sanctified the practice, obliterated the use and
meaning of this primitive language. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a>

constituit. Hoc solum praecepit, ut qui quaerere velit, nudus quaerat,

certainty of laws has been founded among all nations. Those of the
Romans were very intimately allied with the ancient religion, and
must of necessity have disappeared as Rome attained a higher degree
of civilization. Have not modern nations, even the most civilized,
overloaded their laws with a thousand forms, often absurd, almost always
trivial? How many examples are afforded by the English law! See, on the
nature of these forms, the work of M. de Savigny on the Vocation of our

</p>
<p>
A more liberal art was cultivated, however, by the sage of Rome, who, in
a stricter sense, may be considered as the authors of the civil law. The
alteration of the idiom and manners of the Romans rendered the style
of the Twelve Tables less familiar to each rising generation, and the
doubtful passages were imperfectly explained by the study of legal
antiquarians. To define the ambiguities, to circumscribe the latitude,
to apply the principles, to extend the consequences, to reconcile the
real or apparent contradictions, was a much nobler and more important
task; and the province of legislation was silently invaded by the
expounders of ancient statutes. Their subtle interpretations concurred
with the equity of the praetor, to reform the tyranny of the darker
ages: however strange or intricate the means, it was the aim of
artificial jurisprudence to restore the simple dictates of nature and
reason, and the skill of private citizens was usefully employed to
undermine the public institutions of their country. <a href="#note-521" name="noteref-521"><small>521</small></a> The revolution
of almost one thousand years, from the Twelve Tables to the reign of
Justinian, may be divided into three periods, almost equal in duration,
and distinguished from each other by the mode of instruction and the
character of the civilians. <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> Pride and ignorance contributed, during
the first period, to confine within narrow limits the science of the
Roman law. On the public days of market or assembly, the masters of the
art were seen walking in the forum ready to impart the needful advice
to the meanest of their fellow-citizens, from whose votes, on a future
occasion, they might solicit a grateful return. As their years and
honors increased, they seated themselves at home on a chair or throne,
to expect with patient gravity the visits of their clients, who at the
dawn of day, from the town and country, began to thunder at their door.
The duties of social life, and the incidents of judicial proceeding,
were the ordinary subject of these consultations, and the verbal or
written opinion of the juris-consults was framed according to the rules
of prudence and law. The youths of their own order and family were
permitted to listen; their children enjoyed the benefit of more private
lessons, and the Mucian race was long renowned for the hereditary
knowledge of the civil law. The second period, the learned and splendid
age of jurisprudence, may be extended from the birth of Cicero to
the reign of Severus Alexander. A system was formed, schools were
instituted, books were composed, and both the living and the dead became
subservient to the instruction of the student. The tripartite of Aelius
Paetus, surnamed Catus, or the Cunning, was preserved as the oldest work
of Jurisprudence. Cato the censor derived some additional fame from his
legal studies, and those of his son: the kindred appellation of Mucius
Scaevola was illustrated by three sages of the law; but the perfection
of the science was ascribed to Servius Sulpicius, their disciple, and
the friend of Tully; and the long succession, which shone with equal
lustre under the republic and under the Caesars, is finally closed by
the respectable characters of Papinian, of Paul, and of Ulpian. Their
names, and the various titles of their productions, have been minutely
preserved, and the example of Labeo may suggest some idea of their
diligence and fecundity. That eminent lawyer of the Augustan age divided
the year between the city and country, between business and composition;
and four hundred books are enumerated as the fruit of his retirement. Of
the collection of his rival Capito, the two hundred and fifty-ninth book
is expressly quoted; and few teachers could deliver their opinions in
less than a century of volumes. In the third period, between the reigns
of Alexander and Justinian, the oracles of jurisprudence were almost
mute. The measure of curiosity had been filled: the throne was occupied
by tyrants and Barbarians, the active spirits were diverted by religious
disputes, and the professors of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus,
were humbly content to repeat the lessons of their more enlightened
predecessors. From the slow advances and rapid decay of these legal
studies, it may be inferred, that they require a state of peace and
refinement. From the multitude of voluminous civilians who fill the
intermediate space, it is evident that such studies may be pursued,
and such works may be performed, with a common share of judgment,
experience, and industry. The genius of Cicero and Virgil was more
sensibly felt, as each revolving age had been found incapable of
producing a similar or a second: but the most eminent teachers of the
law were assured of leaving disciples equal or superior to themselves in
merit and reputation.

* Note: It is particularly in this division of the history of
the Roman jurisprudence into epochs, that Gibbon displays his profound
knowledge of the laws of this people. M. Hugo, adopting this division,
prefaced these three periods with the history of the times anterior to
the Law of the Twelve Tables, which are, as it were, the infancy of the
Roman law.&mdash;W]
</p>
<p>
The jurisprudence which had been grossly adapted to the wants of the
first Romans, was polished and improved in the seventh century of the
city, by the alliance of Grecian philosophy. The Scaevolas had been
taught by use and experience; but Servius Sulpicius <a href="#note-5311" name="noteref-5311"><small>5311</small></a> was the first
civilian who established his art on a certain and general theory. <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a>
For the discernment of truth and falsehood he applied, as an infallible
rule, the logic of Aristotle and the stoics, reduced particular cases
to general principles, and diffused over the shapeless mass the light of
order and eloquence. Cicero, his contemporary and friend, declined the
reputation of a professed lawyer; but the jurisprudence of his country
was adorned by his incomparable genius, which converts into gold every
object that it touches. After the example of Plato, he composed a
republic; and, for the use of his republic, a treatise of laws; in which
he labors to deduce from a celestial origin the wisdom and justice of
the Roman constitution. The whole universe, according to his sublime
hypothesis, forms one immense commonwealth: gods and men, who
participate of the same essence, are members of the same community;
reason prescribes the law of nature and nations; and all positive
institutions, however modified by accident or custom, are drawn from
the rule of right, which the Deity has inscribed on every virtuous mind.
From these philosophical mysteries, he mildly excludes the sceptics
who refuse to believe, and the epicureans who are unwilling to act. The
latter disdain the care of the republic: he advises them to slumber in
their shady gardens. But he humbly entreats that the new academy would
be silent, since her bold objections would too soon destroy the fair and
well ordered structure of his lofty system. <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> Plato, Aristotle, and
Zeno, he represents as the only teachers who arm and instruct a citizen
for the duties of social life. Of these, the armor of the stoics <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a>
was found to be of the firmest temper; and it was chiefly worn, both for
use and ornament, in the schools of jurisprudence. From the portico, the
Roman civilians learned to live, to reason, and to die: but they imbibed
in some degree the prejudices of the sect; the love of paradox, the
pertinacious habits of dispute, and a minute attachment to words and
verbal distinctions. The superiority of form to matter was introduced
to ascertain the right of property: and the equality of crimes is
countenanced by an opinion of Trebatius, <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> that he who touches the
ear, touches the whole body; and that he who steals from a heap of corn,
or a hogshead of wine, is guilty of the entire theft. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a>

</p>
<p>
Arms, eloquence, and the study of the civil law, promoted a citizen to
the honors of the Roman state; and the three professions were
sometimes more conspicuous by their union in the same character. In
the composition of the edict, a learned praetor gave a sanction and
preference to his private sentiments; the opinion of a censor, or a
counsel, was entertained with respect; and a doubtful interpretation of
the laws might be supported by the virtues or triumphs of the civilian.
The patrician arts were long protected by the veil of mystery; and in
more enlightened times, the freedom of inquiry established the general
principles of jurisprudence. Subtile and intricate cases were elucidated
by the disputes of the forum: rules, axioms, and definitions, <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> were
admitted as the genuine dictates of reason; and the consent of the legal
professors was interwoven into the practice of the tribunals. But these
interpreters could neither enact nor execute the laws of the republic;
and the judges might disregard the authority of the Scaevolas
themselves, which was often overthrown by the eloquence or sophistry
of an ingenious pleader. <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> Augustus and Tiberius were the first
to adopt, as a useful engine, the science of the civilians; and their
servile labors accommodated the old system to the spirit and views of
despotism. Under the fair pretence of securing the dignity of the art,
the privilege of subscribing legal and valid opinions was confined to
the sages of senatorian or equestrian rank, who had been previously
approved by the judgment of the prince; and this monopoly prevailed,
till Adrian restored the freedom of the profession to every citizen
conscious of his abilities and knowledge. The discretion of the praetor
was now governed by the lessons of his teachers; the judges were
enjoined to obey the comment as well as the text of the law; and the use
of codicils was a memorable innovation, which Augustus ratified by the
advice of the civilians. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> <a href="#note-6111" name="noteref-6111"><small>6111</small></a>

[ The author here follows the then generally received
opinion of Heineccius. The proofs which appear to confirm it are l. 2
47, D. I. 2, and 8. Instit. I. 2. The first of these passages speaks
expressly of a privilege granted to certain lawyers, until the time of
Adrian, publice respondendi jus ante Augusti tempora non dabatur. Primus
Divus ut major juris auctoritas haberetur, constituit, ut ex auctoritate
ejus responderent. The passage of the Institutes speaks of the different
opinions of those, quibus est permissum jura condere. It is true that
the first of these passages does not say that the opinion of these
privileged lawyers had the force of a law for the judges. For this
reason M. Hugo altogether rejects the opinion adopted by Heineccius, by
Bach, and in general by all the writers who preceded him. He conceives
that the 8 of the Institutes referred to the constitution of Valentinian
III., which regulated the respective authority to be ascribed to the
different writings of the great civilians. But we have now the following
passage in the Institutes of Gaius: Responsa prudentum sunt sententiae
et opiniones eorum, quibus permissum est jura condere; quorum omnium
si in unum sententiae concorrupt, id quod ita sentiunt, legis vicem
obtinet, si vero dissentiunt, judici licet, quam velit sententiam
sequi, idque rescripto Divi Hadrian signiticatur. I do not know, how in
opposition to this passage, the opinion of M. Hugo can be maintained. We
must add to this the passage quoted from Pomponius and from such strong
proofs, it seems incontestable that the emperors had granted some kind
of privilege to certain civilians, quibus permissum erat jura condere.
Their opinion had sometimes the force of law, legis vicem. M. Hugo,
endeavoring to reconcile this phrase with his system, gives it a forced
interpretation, which quite alters the sense; he supposes that the
passage contains no more than what is evident of itself, that the
authority of the civilians was to be respected, thus making a privilege
of that which was free to all the world. It appears to me almost
indisputable, that the emperors had sanctioned certain provisions
relative to the authority of these civilians, consulted by the judges.
But how far was their advice to be respected? This is a question
which it is impossible to answer precisely, from the want of historic
evidence. Is it not possible that the emperors established an authority
to be consulted by the judges? and in this case this authority must have
emanated from certain civilians named for this purpose by the emperors.
See Hugo, l. c. Moreover, may not the passage of Suetonius, in the Life
of Caligula, where he says that the emperor would no longer permit
the civilians to give their advice, mean that Caligula entertained the
design of suppressing this institution? See on this passage the Themis,
vol. xi. p. 17, 36. Our author not being acquainted with the opinions
opposed to Heineccius has not gone to the bottom of the subject.&mdash;W.]
</p>
<p>
The most absolute mandate could only require that the judges should
agree with the civilians, if the civilians agreed among themselves. But
positive institutions are often the result of custom and prejudice; laws
and language are ambiguous and arbitrary; where reason is incapable of
pronouncing, the love of argument is inflamed by the envy of rivals,
the vanity of masters, the blind attachment of their disciples; and
the Roman jurisprudence was divided by the once famous sects of the
Proculians and Sabinians. <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> Two sages of the law, Ateius Capito and
Antistius Labeo, <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> adorned the peace of the Augustan age; the former
distinguished by the favor of his sovereign; the latter more illustrious
by his contempt of that favor, and his stern though harmless opposition
to the tyrant of Rome. Their legal studies were influenced by the
various colors of their temper and principles. Labeo was attached to
the form of the old republic; his rival embraced the more profitable
substance of the rising monarchy. But the disposition of a courtier
is tame and submissive; and Capito seldom presumed to deviate from the
sentiments, or at least from the words, of his predecessors; while the
bold republican pursued his independent ideas without fear of paradox or
innovations. The freedom of Labeo was enslaved, however, by the rigor of
his own conclusions, and he decided, according to the letter of the
law, the same questions which his indulgent competitor resolved with
a latitude of equity more suitable to the common sense and feelings
of mankind. If a fair exchange had been substituted to the payment of
money, Capito still considered the transaction as a legal sale; <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a>
and he consulted nature for the age of puberty, without confining his
definition to the precise period of twelve or fourteen years. <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> This
opposition of sentiments was propagated in the writings and lessons
of the two founders; the schools of Capito and Labeo maintained their
inveterate conflict from the age of Augustus to that of Adrian; <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a>
and the two sects derived their appellations from Sabinus and Proculus,
their most celebrated teachers. The names of Cassians and Pegasians were
likewise applied to the same parties; but, by a strange reverse,
the popular cause was in the hands of Pegasus, <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> a timid slave of
Domitian, while the favorite of the Caesars was represented by Cassius,
<a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> who gloried in his descent from the patriot assassin. By the
perpetual edict, the controversies of the sects were in a great measure
determined. For that important work, the emperor Adrian preferred the
chief of the Sabinians: the friends of monarchy prevailed; but the
moderation of Salvius Julian insensibly reconciled the victors and the
vanquished. Like the contemporary philosophers, the lawyers of the age
of the Antonines disclaimed the authority of a master, and adopted from
every system the most probable doctrines. <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> But their writings would
have been less voluminous, had their choice been more unanimous. The
conscience of the judge was perplexed by the number and weight of
discordant testimonies, and every sentence that his passion or interest
might pronounce was justified by the sanction of some venerable name. An
indulgent edict of the younger Theodosius excused him from the labor of
comparing and weighing their arguments. Five civilians, Caius, Papinian,
Paul, Ulpian, and Modestinus, were established as the oracles of
jurisprudence: a majority was decisive: but if their opinions were
equally divided, a casting vote was ascribed to the superior wisdom of
Papinian. <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a>

after the marriage of Valentinian III. Among these pieces are the
constitutions which nominate commissioners for the formation of the

in these documents, they communicate many facts relative to this
legislation. 1. That Theodosius designed a great reform in the
legislation; to add to the Gregorian and Hermogenian codes all the new
constitutions from Constantine to his own day; and to frame a second
code for common use with extracts from the three codes, and from the
works of the civil lawyers. All laws either abrogated or fallen into
disuse were to be noted under their proper heads. 2. An Ordinance was
issued in 429 to form a commission for this purpose of nine persons,
of which Antiochus, as quaestor and praefectus, was president. A
second commission of sixteen members was issued in 435 under the
same president. 3. A code, which we possess under the name of Codex
Theodosianus, was finished in 438, published in the East, in an
ordinance addressed to the Praetorian praefect, Florentinus, and
intended to be published in the West. 4. Before it was published in the
West, Valentinian submitted it to the senate. There is a report of

<h2>
    Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
When Justinian ascended the throne, the reformation of the Roman
jurisprudence was an arduous but indispensable task. In the space of ten
centuries, the infinite variety of laws and legal opinions had filled
many thousand volumes, which no fortune could purchase and no capacity
could digest. Books could not easily be found; and the judges, poor in
the midst of riches, were reduced to the exercise of their illiterate
discretion. The subjects of the Greek provinces were ignorant of the
language that disposed of their lives and properties; and the barbarous
dialect of the Latins was imperfectly studied in the academies of
Berytus and Constantinople. As an Illyrian soldier, that idiom was
familiar to the infancy of Justinian; his youth had been instructed by
the lessons of jurisprudence, and his Imperial choice selected the most
learned civilians of the East, to labor with their sovereign in the
work of reformation. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> The theory of professors was assisted by the
practice of advocates, and the experience of magistrates; and the
whole undertaking was animated by the spirit of Tribonian. <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> This
extraordinary man, the object of so much praise and censure, was
a native of Side in Pamphylia; and his genius, like that of Bacon,
embraced, as his own, all the business and knowledge of the age.
Tribonian composed, both in prose and verse, on a strange diversity of
curious and abstruse subjects: <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> a double panegyric of Justinian and
the life of the philosopher Theodotus; the nature of happiness and the
duties of government; Homer's catalogue and the four-and-twenty sorts of
metre; the astronomical canon of Ptolemy; the changes of the months;
the houses of the planets; and the harmonic system of the world. To the
literature of Greece he added the use of the Latin tonque; the Roman
civilians were deposited in his library and in his mind; and he most
assiduously cultivated those arts which opened the road of wealth and
preferment. From the bar of the Praetorian praefects, he raised himself
to the honors of quaestor, of consul, and of master of the offices: the
council of Justinian listened to his eloquence and wisdom; and envy
was mitigated by the gentleness and affability of his manners. The
reproaches of impiety and avarice have stained the virtue or the
reputation of Tribonian. In a bigoted and persecuting court, the
principal minister was accused of a secret aversion to the Christian
faith, and was supposed to entertain the sentiments of an Atheist and
a Pagan, which have been imputed, inconsistently enough, to the last
philosophers of Greece. His avarice was more clearly proved and more
sensibly felt. If he were swayed by gifts in the administration of
justice, the example of Bacon will again occur; nor can the merit of
Tribonian atone for his baseness, if he degraded the sanctity of his
profession; and if laws were every day enacted, modified, or repealed,
for the base consideration of his private emolument. In the sedition of
Constantinople, his removal was granted to the clamors, perhaps to the
just indignation, of the people: but the quaestor was speedily restored,
and, till the hour of his death, he possessed, above twenty years, the
favor and confidence of the emperor. His passive and dutiful submission
had been honored with the praise of Justinian himself, whose vanity was
incapable of discerning how often that submission degenerated into the
grossest adulation. Tribonian adored the virtues of his gracious of
his gracious master; the earth was unworthy of such a prince; and he
affected a pious fear, that Justinian, like Elijah or Romulus, would be
snatched into the air, and translated alive to the mansions of celestial
glory. <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a>

</p>
<p>
If Caesar had achieved the reformation of the Roman law, his creative
genius, enlightened by reflection and study, would have given to the
world a pure and original system of jurisprudence. Whatever flattery
might suggest, the emperor of the East was afraid to establish his
private judgment as the standard of equity: in the possession of
legislative power, he borrowed the aid of time and opinion; and his
laborious compilations are guarded by the sages and legislature of past
times. Instead of a statue cast in a simple mould by the hand of an
artist, the works of Justinian represent a tessellated pavement of
antique and costly, but too often of incoherent, fragments. In the first
year of his reign, he directed the faithful Tribonian, and nine learned
associates, to revise the ordinances of his predecessors, as they were
contained, since the time of Adrian, in the Gregorian Hermogenian, and
Theodosian codes; to purge the errors and contradictions, to retrench
whatever was obsolete or superfluous, and to select the wise and
salutary laws best adapted to the practice of the tribunals and the use
of his subjects. The work was accomplished in fourteen months; and
the twelve books or tables, which the new decemvirs produced, might be
designed to imitate the labors of their Roman predecessors. The new
Code of Justinian was honored with his name, and confirmed by his royal
signature: authentic transcripts were multiplied by the pens of notaries
and scribes; they were transmitted to the magistrates of the European,
the Asiatic, and afterwards the African provinces; and the law of the
empire was proclaimed on solemn festivals at the doors of churches.
A more arduous operation was still behind&mdash;to extract the spirit of
jurisprudence from the decisions and conjectures, the questions and
disputes, of the Roman civilians. Seventeen lawyers, with Tribonian
at their head, were appointed by the emperor to exercise an absolute
jurisdiction over the works of their predecessors. If they had obeyed
his commands in ten years, Justinian would have been satisfied with
their diligence; and the rapid composition of the Digest of Pandects,
<a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> in three years, will deserve praise or censure, according to the
merit of the execution. From the library of Tribonian, they chose forty,
the most eminent civilians of former times: <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a> two thousand treatises
were comprised in an abridgment of fifty books; and it has been
carefully recorded, that three millions of lines or sentences, <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> were
reduced, in this abstract, to the moderate number of one hundred and
fifty thousand. The edition of this great work was delayed a month
after that of the Institutes; and it seemed reasonable that the elements
should precede the digest of the Roman law. As soon as the emperor
had approved their labors, he ratified, by his legislative power, the
speculations of these private citizens: their commentaries, on the
twelve tables, the perpetual edict, the laws of the people, and the
decrees of the senate, succeeded to the authority of the text; and the
text was abandoned, as a useless, though venerable, relic of antiquity.
The Code, the Pandects, and the Institutes, were declared to be the
legitimate system of civil jurisprudence; they alone were admitted into
the tribunals, and they alone were taught in the academies of Rome,
Constantinople, and Berytus. Justinian addressed to the senate and
provinces his eternal oracles; and his pride, under the mask of piety,
ascribed the consummation of this great design to the support and
inspiration of the Deity.

Since the emperor declined the fame and envy of original composition, we
can only require, at his hands, method choice, and fidelity, the
humble, though indispensable, virtues of a compiler. Among the various
combinations of ideas, it is difficult to assign any reasonable
preference; but as the order of Justinian is different in his three
works, it is possible that all may be wrong; and it is certain that
two cannot be right. In the selection of ancient laws, he seems to have
viewed his predecessors without jealousy, and with equal regard: the
series could not ascend above the reign of Adrian, and the narrow
distinction of Paganism and Christianity, introduced by the superstition
of Theodosius, had been abolished by the consent of mankind. But the
jurisprudence of the Pandects is circumscribed within a period of
a hundred years, from the perpetual edict to the death of Severus
Alexander: the civilians who lived under the first Caesars are seldom
permitted to speak, and only three names can be attributed to the age of
the republic. The favorite of Justinian (it has been fiercely urged) was
fearful of encountering the light of freedom and the gravity of Roman
sages.
</p>
<p>
Tribonian condemned to oblivion the genuine and native wisdom of Cato,
the Scaevolas, and Sulpicius; while he invoked spirits more congenial to
his own, the Syrians, Greeks, and Africans, who flocked to the Imperial
court to study Latin as a foreign tongue, and jurisprudence as a
lucrative profession. But the ministers of Justinian, <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> were
instructed to labor, not for the curiosity of antiquarians, but for
the immediate benefit of his subjects. It was their duty to select the
useful and practical parts of the Roman law; and the writings of the old
republicans, however curious on excellent, were no longer suited to
the new system of manners, religion, and government. Perhaps, if the
preceptors and friends of Cicero were still alive, our candor would
acknowledge, that, except in purity of language, <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> their intrinsic
merit was excelled by the school of Papinian and Ulpian. The science of
the laws is the slow growth of time and experience, and the advantage
both of method and materials, is naturally assumed by the most recent
authors. The civilians of the reign of the Antonines had studied the
works of their predecessors: their philosophic spirit had mitigated the
rigor of antiquity, simplified the forms of proceeding, and emerged
from the jealousy and prejudice of the rival sects. The choice of
the authorities that compose the Pandects depended on the judgment of
Tribonian: but the power of his sovereign could not absolve him from
the sacred obligations of truth and fidelity. As the legislator of the
empire, Justinian might repeal the acts of the Antonines, or condemn, as
seditious, the free principles, which were maintained by the last of the
Roman lawyers. <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> But the existence of past facts is placed beyond
the reach of despotism; and the emperor was guilty of fraud and forgery,
when he corrupted the integrity of their text, inscribed with their
venerable names the words and ideas of his servile reign, <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> and
suppressed, by the hand of power, the pure and authentic copies of
their sentiments. The changes and interpolations of Tribonian and his
colleagues are excused by the pretence of uniformity: but their cares
have been insufficient, and the antinomies, or contradictions of the
Code and Pandects, still exercise the patience and subtilty of modern
civilians. <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a>

A rumor devoid of evidence has been propagated by the enemies of
Justinian; that the jurisprudence of ancient Rome was reduced to ashes
by the author of the Pandects, from the vain persuasion, that it was now
either false or superfluous. Without usurping an office so
invidious, the emperor might safely commit to ignorance and time the
accomplishments of this destructive wish. Before the invention of
printing and paper, the labor and the materials of writing could be
purchased only by the rich; and it may reasonably be computed, that the
price of books was a hundred fold their present value. <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> Copies were
slowly multiplied and cautiously renewed: the hopes of profit tempted
the sacrilegious scribes to erase the characters of antiquity, <a href="#note-8311" name="noteref-8311"><small>8311</small></a>
and Sophocles or Tacitus were obliged to resign the parchment to
missals, homilies, and the golden legend. <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> If such was the fate
of the most beautiful compositions of genius, what stability could be
expected for the dull and barren works of an obsolete science? The books
of jurisprudence were interesting to few, and entertaining to none:
their value was connected with present use, and they sunk forever as
soon as that use was superseded by the innovations of fashion, superior
merit, or public authority. In the age of peace and learning, between
Cicero and the last of the Antonines, many losses had been already
sustained, and some luminaries of the school, or forum, were known only
to the curious by tradition and report. Three hundred and sixty years
of disorder and decay accelerated the progress of oblivion; and it may
fairly be presumed, that of the writings, which Justinian is accused
of neglecting, many were no longer to be found in the libraries of the
East. <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> The copies of Papinian, or Ulpian, which the reformer had
proscribed, were deemed unworthy of future notice: the Twelve Tables and
praetorian edicts insensibly vanished, and the monuments of ancient Rome
were neglected or destroyed by the envy and ignorance of the Greeks.

a single manuscript. His Historia Pandectarum Florentinorum, (Utrecht,
1722, in 4to.,) though a monument of industry, is a small portion of his
original design.]
</p>
<p>
It is the first care of a reformer to prevent any future reformation. To
maintain the text of the Pandects, the Institutes, and the Code, the use
of ciphers and abbreviations was rigorously proscribed; and as Justinian
recollected, that the perpetual edict had been buried under the weight
of commentators, he denounced the punishment of forgery against the rash
civilians who should presume to interpret or pervert the will of their
sovereign. The scholars of Accursius, of Bartolus, of Cujacius, should
blush for their accumulated guilt, unless they dare to dispute his right
of binding the authority of his successors, and the native freedom of
the mind. But the emperor was unable to fix his own inconstancy; and,
while he boasted of renewing the exchange of Diomede, of transmuting
brass into gold, <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> discovered the necessity of purifying his gold
from the mixture of baser alloy. Six years had not elapsed from the
publication of the Code, before he condemned the imperfect attempt, by
a new and more accurate edition of the same work; which he enriched with
two hundred of his own laws, and fifty decisions of the darkest and
most intricate points of jurisprudence. Every year, or, according
to Procopius, each day, of his long reign, was marked by some legal
innovation. Many of his acts were rescinded by himself; many were
rejected by his successors; many have been obliterated by time; but the
number of sixteen Edicts, and one hundred and sixty-eight Novels, <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a>
has been admitted into the authentic body of the civil jurisprudence.
In the opinion of a philosopher superior to the prejudices of
his profession, these incessant, and, for the most part, trifling
alterations, can be only explained by the venal spirit of a prince, who
sold without shame his judgments and his laws. <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> The charge of the
secret historian is indeed explicit and vehement; but the sole instance,
which he produces, may be ascribed to the devotion as well as to the
avarice of Justinian. A wealthy bigot had bequeathed his inheritance to
the church of Emesa; and its value was enhanced by the dexterity of an
artist, who subscribed confessions of debt and promises of payment
with the names of the richest Syrians. They pleaded the established
prescription of thirty or forty years; but their defence was overruled
by a retrospective edict, which extended the claims of the church to
the term of a century; an edict so pregnant with injustice and disorder,
that, after serving this occasional purpose, it was prudently abolished
in the same reign. <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> If candor will acquit the emperor himself, and
transfer the corruption to his wife and favorites, the suspicion of
so foul a vice must still degrade the majesty of his laws; and the
advocates of Justinian may acknowledge, that such levity, whatsoever be
the motive, is unworthy of a legislator and a man.

Monarchs seldom condescend to become the preceptors of their subjects;
and some praise is due to Justinian, by whose command an ample system
was reduced to a short and elementary treatise. Among the various
institutes of the Roman law, <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> those of Caius <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> were the most
popular in the East and West; and their use may be considered as an
evidence of their merit. They were selected by the Imperial delegates,
Tribonian, Theophilus, and Dorotheus; and the freedom and purity of the
Antonines was incrusted with the coarser materials of a degenerate age.
The same volume which introduced the youth of Rome, Constantinople,
and Berytus, to the gradual study of the Code and Pandects, is still
precious to the historian, the philosopher, and the magistrate. The
Institutes of Justinian are divided into four books: they proceed,
with no contemptible method, from, I. Persons, to, II. Things, and from
things, to, III. Actions; and the article IV., of Private Wrongs, is
terminated by the principles of Criminal Law. <a href="#note-9811" name="noteref-9811"><small>9811</small></a>

    Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>
<p>
The distinction of ranks and persons is the firmest basis of a mixed and
limited government. In France, the remains of liberty are kept alive
by the spirit, the honors, and even the prejudices, of fifty thousand
nobles. <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> Two hundred families <a href="#note-9911" name="noteref-9911"><small>9911</small></a> supply, in lineal descent, the
second branch of English legislature, which maintains, between the king
and commons, the balance of the constitution. A gradation of patricians
and plebeians, of strangers and subjects, has supported the aristocracy
of Genoa, Venice, and ancient Rome. The perfect equality of men is the
point in which the extremes of democracy and despotism are confounded;
since the majesty of the prince or people would be offended, if
any heads were exalted above the level of their fellow-slaves or
fellow-citizens. In the decline of the Roman empire, the proud
distinctions of the republic were gradually abolished, and the reason or
instinct of Justinian completed the simple form of an absolute monarchy.
The emperor could not eradicate the popular reverence which always
waits on the possession of hereditary wealth, or the memory of famous
ancestors. He delighted to honor, with titles and emoluments, his
generals, magistrates, and senators; and his precarious indulgence
communicated some rays of their glory to the persons of their wives and
children. But in the eye of the law, all Roman citizens were equal,
and all subjects of the empire were citizens of Rome. That inestimable
character was degraded to an obsolete and empty name. The voice of a
Roman could no longer enact his laws, or create the annual ministers of
his power: his constitutional rights might have checked the arbitrary
will of a master: and the bold adventurer from Germany or Arabia was
admitted, with equal favor, to the civil and military command, which the
citizen alone had been once entitled to assume over the conquests of his
fathers. The first Caesars had scrupulously guarded the distinction of
ingenuous and servile birth, which was decided by the condition of the
mother; and the candor of the laws was satisfied, if her freedom could
be ascertained, during a single moment, between the conception and
the delivery. The slaves, who were liberated by a generous master,
immediately entered into the middle class of libertines or freedmen;
but they could never be enfranchised from the duties of obedience and
gratitude; whatever were the fruits of their industry, their patron and
his family inherited the third part; or even the whole of their fortune,
if they died without children and without a testament. Justinian
respected the rights of patrons; but his indulgence removed the badge of
disgrace from the two inferior orders of freedmen; whoever ceased to be
a slave, obtained, without reserve or delay, the station of a citizen;
and at length the dignity of an ingenuous birth, which nature had
refused, was created, or supposed, by the omnipotence of the emperor.
Whatever restraints of age, or forms, or numbers, had been formerly
introduced to check the abuse of manumissions, and the too rapid
increase of vile and indigent Romans, he finally abolished; and the
spirit of his laws promoted the extinction of domestic servitude.
Yet the eastern provinces were filled, in the time of Justinian, with
multitudes of slaves, either born or purchased for the use of their
masters; and the price, from ten to seventy pieces of gold, was
determined by their age, their strength, and their education. <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> But
the hardships of this dependent state were continually diminished by the
influence of government and religion: and the pride of a subject was no
longer elated by his absolute dominion over the life and happiness of
his bondsman. <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a>

The law of nature instructs most animals to cherish and educate their
infant progeny. The law of reason inculcates to the human species the
returns of filial piety. But the exclusive, absolute, and perpetual
dominion of the father over his children, is peculiar to the Roman
jurisprudence, <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> and seems to be coeval with the foundation of the
city. <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> The paternal power was instituted or confirmed by Romulus
himself; and, after the practice of three centuries, it was inscribed
on the fourth table of the Decemvirs. In the forum, the senate, or the
camp, the adult son of a Roman citizen enjoyed the public and private
rights of a person: in his father's house he was a mere thing; <a href="#note-1031" name="noteref-1031"><small>1031</small></a>
confounded by the laws with the movables, the cattle, and the slaves,
whom the capricious master might alienate or destroy, without being
responsible to any earthly tribunal. The hand which bestowed the daily
sustenance might resume the voluntary gift, and whatever was acquired by
the labor or fortune of the son was immediately lost in the property
of the father. His stolen goods (his oxen or his children) might be
recovered by the same action of theft; <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> and if either had been
guilty of a trespass, it was in his own option to compensate the damage,
or resign to the injured party the obnoxious animal. At the call of
indigence or avarice, the master of a family could dispose of his
children or his slaves. But the condition of the slave was far more
advantageous, since he regained, by the first manumission, his alienated
freedom: the son was again restored to his unnatural father; he might
be condemned to servitude a second and a third time, and it was not till
after the third sale and deliverance, <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> that he was enfranchised
from the domestic power which had been so repeatedly abused. According
to his discretion, a father might chastise the real or imaginary faults
of his children, by stripes, by imprisonment, by exile, by sending them
to the country to work in chains among the meanest of his servants. The
majesty of a parent was armed with the power of life and death; <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a>
and the examples of such bloody executions, which were sometimes praised
and never punished, may be traced in the annals of Rome beyond the times
of Pompey and Augustus. Neither age, nor rank, nor the consular office,
nor the honors of a triumph, could exempt the most illustrious citizen
from the bonds of filial subjection: <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a> his own descendants were
included in the family of their common ancestor; and the claims of
adoption were not less sacred or less rigorous than those of nature.
Without fear, though not without danger of abuse, the Roman legislators
had reposed an unbounded confidence in the sentiments of paternal love;
and the oppression was tempered by the assurance that each generation
must succeed in its turn to the awful dignity of parent and master.

<p>
The first limitation of paternal power is ascribed to the justice and
humanity of Numa; and the maid who, with his father's consent, had
espoused a freeman, was protected from the disgrace of becoming the
wife of a slave. In the first ages, when the city was pressed, and often
famished, by her Latin and Tuscan neighbors, the sale of children might
be a frequent practice; but as a Roman could not legally purchase the
liberty of his fellow-citizen, the market must gradually fail, and the
trade would be destroyed by the conquests of the republic. An imperfect
right of property was at length communicated to sons; and the threefold
distinction of profectitious, adventitious, and professional was
ascertained by the jurisprudence of the Code and Pandects. <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> Of all
that proceeded from the father, he imparted only the use, and reserved
the absolute dominion; yet if his goods were sold, the filial portion
was excepted, by a favorable interpretation, from the demands of
the creditors. In whatever accrued by marriage, gift, or collateral
succession, the property was secured to the son; but the father, unless
he had been specially excluded, enjoyed the usufruct during his life.
As a just and prudent reward of military virtue, the spoils of the enemy
were acquired, possessed, and bequeathed by the soldier alone; and the
fair analogy was extended to the emoluments of any liberal profession,
the salary of public service, and the sacred liberality of the emperor
or empress. The life of a citizen was less exposed than his fortune
to the abuse of paternal power. Yet his life might be adverse to the
interest or passions of an unworthy father: the same crimes that flowed
from the corruption, were more sensibly felt by the humanity, of the
Augustan age; and the cruel Erixo, who whipped his son till he expired,
was saved by the emperor from the just fury of the multitude. <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> The
Roman father, from the license of servile dominion, was reduced to the
gravity and moderation of a judge. The presence and opinion of Augustus
confirmed the sentence of exile pronounced against an intentional
parricide by the domestic tribunal of Arius. Adrian transported to
an island the jealous parent, who, like a robber, had seized the
opportunity of hunting, to assassinate a youth, the incestuous lover of
his step-mother. <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> A private jurisdiction is repugnant to the spirit
of monarchy; the parent was again reduced from a judge to an accuser;
and the magistrates were enjoined by Severus Alexander to hear his
complaints and execute his sentence. He could no longer take the life
of a son without incurring the guilt and punishment of murder; and the
pains of parricide, from which he had been excepted by the Pompeian law,
were finally inflicted by the justice of Constantine. <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a> The same
protection was due to every period of existence; and reason must applaud
the humanity of Paulus, for imputing the crime of murder to the father
who strangles, or starves, or abandons his new-born infant; or exposes
him in a public place to find the mercy which he himself had denied.
But the exposition of children was the prevailing and stubborn vice of
antiquity: it was sometimes prescribed, often permitted, almost always
practised with impunity, by the nations who never entertained the Roman
ideas of paternal power; and the dramatic poets, who appeal to the human
heart, represent with indifference a popular custom which was palliated
by the motives of economy and compassion. <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> If the father could
subdue his own feelings, he might escape, though not the censure, at
least the chastisement, of the laws; and the Roman empire was stained
with the blood of infants, till such murders were included, by
Valentinian and his colleagues, in the letter and spirit of the
Cornelian law. The lessons of jurisprudence <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> and Christianity had
been insufficient to eradicate this inhuman practice, till their gentle
influence was fortified by the terrors of capital punishment. <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a>

Experience has proved, that savages are the tyrants of the female sex,
and that the condition of women is usually softened by the refinements
of social life. In the hope of a robust progeny, Lycurgus had delayed
the season of marriage: it was fixed by Numa at the tender age of twelve
years, that the Roman husband might educate to his will a pure and
obedient virgin. <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> According to the custom of antiquity, he bought
his bride of her parents, and she fulfilled the coemption by purchasing,
with three pieces of copper, a just introduction to his house and
household deities. A sacrifice of fruits was offered by the pontiffs in
the presence of ten witnesses; the contracting parties were seated on
the same sheep-skin; they tasted a salt cake of far or rice; and this
confarreation, <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> which denoted the ancient food of Italy, served as
an emblem of their mystic union of mind and body. But this union on the
side of the woman was rigorous and unequal; and she renounced the name
and worship of her father's house, to embrace a new servitude, decorated
only by the title of adoption, a fiction of the law, neither rational
nor elegant, bestowed on the mother of a family <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> (her proper
appellation) the strange characters of sister to her own children,
and of daughter to her husband or master, who was invested with the
plenitude of paternal power. By his judgment or caprice her behavior was

[ Solon requires three payments per month. By the Misna, a
daily debt was imposed on an idle, vigorous, young husband; twice a week
on a citizen; once on a peasant; once in thirty days on a camel-driver;
once in six months on a seaman. But the student or doctor was free from
tribute; and no wife, if she received a weekly sustenance, could sue
for a divorce; for one week a vow of abstinence was allowed. Polygamy
divided, without multiplying, the duties of the husband, (Selden, Uxor

<p>
After the Punic triumphs, the matrons of Rome aspired to the common
benefits of a free and opulent republic: their wishes were gratified
by the indulgence of fathers and lovers, and their ambition was
unsuccessfully resisted by the gravity of Cato the Censor. <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> They
declined the solemnities of the old nuptiais; defeated the annual
prescription by an absence of three days; and, without losing their name
or independence, subscribed the liberal and definite terms of a marriage
contract. Of their private fortunes, they communicated the use, and
secured the property: the estates of a wife could neither be alienated
nor mortgaged by a prodigal husband; their mutual gifts were prohibited
by the jealousy of the laws; and the misconduct of either party might
afford, under another name, a future subject for an action of theft.
To this loose and voluntary compact, religious and civil rights were no
longer essential; and, between persons of a similar rank, the apparent
community of life was allowed as sufficient evidence of their nuptials.
The dignity of marriage was restored by the Christians, who derived all
spiritual grace from the prayers of the faithful and the benediction
of the priest or bishop. The origin, validity, and duties of the holy
institution were regulated by the tradition of the synagogue, the
precepts of the gospel, and the canons of general or provincial synods;
<a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a> and the conscience of the Christians was awed by the decrees
and censures of their ecclesiastical rulers. Yet the magistrates of
Justinian were not subject to the authority of the church: the emperor
consulted the unbelieving civilians of antiquity, and the choice of
matrimonial laws in the Code and Pandects, is directed by the earthly
motives of justice, policy, and the natural freedom of both sexes. <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a>

<p>
Besides the agreement of the parties, the essence of every rational
contract, the Roman marriage required the previous approbation of the
parents. A father might be forced by some recent laws to supply the
wants of a mature daughter; but even his insanity was not gradually
allowed to supersede the necessity of his consent. The causes of the
dissolution of matrimony have varied among the Romans; <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a> but the
most solemn sacrament, the confarreation itself, might always be done
away by rites of a contrary tendency. In the first ages, the father of a
family might sell his children, and his wife was reckoned in the number
of his children: the domestic judge might pronounce the death of the
offender, or his mercy might expel her from his bed and house; but the
slavery of the wretched female was hopeless and perpetual, unless he
asserted for his own convenience the manly prerogative of divorce.
<a href="#note-1231" name="noteref-1231"><small>1231</small></a> The warmest applause has been lavished on the virtue of the
Romans, who abstained from the exercise of this tempting privilege above
five hundred years: <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a> but the same fact evinces the unequal terms of
a connection in which the slave was unable to renounce her tyrant, and
the tyrant was unwilling to relinquish his slave. When the Roman
matrons became the equal and voluntary companions of their lords, a new
jurisprudence was introduced, that marriage, like other partnerships,
might be dissolved by the abdication of one of the associates. In three
centuries of prosperity and corruption, this principle was enlarged to
frequent practice and pernicious abuse.
</p>
<p>
Passion, interest, or caprice, suggested daily motives for the
dissolution of marriage; a word, a sign, a message, a letter, the
mandate of a freedman, declared the separation; the most tender of human
connections was degraded to a transient society of profit or pleasure.
According to the various conditions of life, both sexes alternately felt
the disgrace and injury: an inconstant spouse transferred her wealth to
a new family, abandoning a numerous, perhaps a spurious, progeny to
the paternal authority and care of her late husband; a beautiful virgin
might be dismissed to the world, old, indigent, and friendless; but
the reluctance of the Romans, when they were pressed to marriage by
Augustus, sufficiently marks, that the prevailing institutions were
least favorable to the males. A specious theory is confuted by this free
and perfect experiment, which demonstrates, that the liberty of divorce
does not contribute to happiness and virtue. The facility of separation
would destroy all mutual confidence, and inflame every trifling dispute:
the minute difference between a husband and a stranger, which might so
easily be removed, might still more easily be forgotten; and the matron,
who in five years can submit to the embraces of eight husbands, must
cease to reverence the chastity of her own person. <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a>

</p>
<p>
Insufficient remedies followed with distant and tardy steps the rapid
progress of the evil. The ancient worship of the Romans afforded a
peculiar goddess to hear and reconcile the complaints of a married
life; but her epithet of Viriplaca, <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> the appeaser of husbands, too
clearly indicates on which side submission and repentance were always
expected. Every act of a citizen was subject to the judgment of the
censors; the first who used the privilege of divorce assigned, at their
command, the motives of his conduct; <a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a> and a senator was expelled
for dismissing his virgin spouse without the knowledge or advice of
his friends. Whenever an action was instituted for the recovery of a
marriage portion, the proetor, as the guardian of equity, examined the
cause and the characters, and gently inclined the scale in favor of the
guiltless and injured party. Augustus, who united the powers of both
magistrates, adopted their different modes of repressing or chastising
the license of divorce. <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> The presence of seven Roman witnesses
was required for the validity of this solemn and deliberate act: if any
adequate provocation had been given by the husband, instead of the delay
of two years, he was compelled to refund immediately, or in the space of
six months; but if he could arraign the manners of his wife, her guilt
or levity was expiated by the loss of the sixth or eighth part of her
marriage portion. The Christian princes were the first who specified the
just causes of a private divorce; their institutions, from Constantine
to Justinian, appear to fluctuate between the custom of the empire
and the wishes of the church, <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a> and the author of the Novels too
frequently reforms the jurisprudence of the Code and Pandects. In
the most rigorous laws, a wife was condemned to support a gamester, a
drunkard, or a libertine, unless he were guilty of homicide, poison, or
sacrilege, in which cases the marriage, as it should seem, might have
been dissolved by the hand of the executioner. But the sacred right of
the husband was invariably maintained, to deliver his name and family
from the disgrace of adultery: the list of mortal sins, either male or
female, was curtailed and enlarged by successive regulations, and the
obstacles of incurable impotence, long absence, and monastic profession,
were allowed to rescind the matrimonial obligation. Whoever transgressed
the permission of the law, was subject to various and heavy penalties.
The woman was stripped of her wealth and ornaments, without excepting
the bodkin of her hair: if the man introduced a new bride into his bed,
her fortune might be lawfully seized by the vengeance of his exiled
wife. Forfeiture was sometimes commuted to a fine; the fine was
sometimes aggravated by transportation to an island, or imprisonment in
a monastery; the injured party was released from the bonds of marriage;
but the offender, during life, or a term of years, was disabled from
the repetition of nuptials. The successor of Justinian yielded to the
prayers of his unhappy subjects, and restored the liberty of divorce by
mutual consent: the civilians were unanimous, <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> the theologians were
divided, <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a> and the ambiguous word, which contains the precept
of Christ, is flexible to any interpretation that the wisdom of a
legislator can demand.

The freedom of love and marriage was restrained among the Romans by
natural and civil impediments. An instinct, almost innate and universal,
appears to prohibit the incestuous commerce <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a> of parents and
children in the infinite series of ascending and descending generations.
Concerning the oblique and collateral branches, nature is indifferent,
reason mute, and custom various and arbitrary. In Egypt, the marriage
of brothers and sisters was admitted without scruple or exception: a
Spartan might espouse the daughter of his father, an Athenian, that of
his mother; and the nuptials of an uncle with his niece were applauded
at Athens as a happy union of the dearest relations. The profane
lawgivers of Rome were never tempted by interest or superstition to
multiply the forbidden degrees: but they inflexibly condemned the
marriage of sisters and brothers, hesitated whether first cousins should
be touched by the same interdict; revered the parental character of
aunts and uncles, <a href="#note-1321" name="noteref-1321"><small>1321</small></a> and treated affinity and adoption as a just
imitation of the ties of blood. According to the proud maxims of the
republic, a legal marriage could only be contracted by free citizens; an
honorable, at least an ingenuous birth, was required for the spouse of
a senator: but the blood of kings could never mingle in legitimate
nuptials with the blood of a Roman; and the name of Stranger degraded
Cleopatra and Berenice, <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> to live the concubines of Mark Antony
and Titus. <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a> This appellation, indeed, so injurious to the majesty,
cannot without indulgence be applied to the manners, of these Oriental
queens. A concubine, in the strict sense of the civilians, was a woman
of servile or plebeian extraction, the sole and faithful companion of a
Roman citizen, who continued in a state of celibacy. Her modest station,
below the honors of a wife, above the infamy of a prostitute, was
acknowledged and approved by the laws: from the age of Augustus to the
tenth century, the use of this secondary marriage prevailed both in
the West and East; and the humble virtues of a concubine were often
preferred to the pomp and insolence of a noble matron. In this
connection, the two Antonines, the best of princes and of men, enjoyed
the comforts of domestic love: the example was imitated by many citizens
impatient of celibacy, but regardful of their families. If at any time
they desired to legitimate their natural children, the conversion was
instantly performed by the celebration of their nuptials with a partner
whose faithfulness and fidelity they had already tried. <a href="#note-1341" name="noteref-1341"><small>1341</small></a> By this
epithet of natural, the offspring of the concubine were distinguished
from the spurious brood of adultery, prostitution, and incest, to whom
Justinian reluctantly grants the necessary aliments of life; and these
natural children alone were capable of succeeding to a sixth part of
the inheritance of their reputed father. According to the rigor of law,
bastards were entitled only to the name and condition of their mother,
from whom they might derive the character of a slave, a stranger, or a
citizen. The outcasts of every family were adopted without reproach as
the children of the state. <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a> <a href="#note-1351" name="noteref-1351"><small>1351</small></a>

could alone inherit; where there were no near legitimate relatives, the

had inherited his father's property under the supposition that he was
legitimate, and had been promoted to a place of dignity, was to be
degraded, his property confiscated, himself punished with stripes and
imprisonment. By the second, all persons, even of the highest rank,

<h2>
    Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.&mdash;Part VI.
</h2>
<p>
The relation of guardian and ward, or in Roman words of tutor and pupil,
which covers so many titles of the Institutes and Pandects, <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a> is of
a very simple and uniform nature. The person and property of an orphan
must always be trusted to the custody of some discreet friend. If the
deceased father had not signified his choice, the agnats, or paternal
kindred of the nearest degree, were compelled to act as the natural
guardians: the Athenians were apprehensive of exposing the infant to
the power of those most interested in his death; but an axiom of
Roman jurisprudence has pronounced, that the charge of tutelage should
constantly attend the emolument of succession. If the choice of the
father, and the line of consanguinity, afforded no efficient guardian,
the failure was supplied by the nomination of the praetor of the city,
or the president of the province. But the person whom they named to
this public office might be legally excused by insanity or blindness, by
ignorance or inability, by previous enmity or adverse interest, by the
number of children or guardianships with which he was already burdened,
and by the immunities which were granted to the useful labors of
magistrates, lawyers, physicians, and professors. Till the infant could
speak, and think, he was represented by the tutor, whose authority was
finally determined by the age of puberty. Without his consent, no act
of the pupil could bind himself to his own prejudice, though it might
oblige others for his personal benefit. It is needless to observe, that
the tutor often gave security, and always rendered an account, and that
the want of diligence or integrity exposed him to a civil and almost
criminal action for the violation of his sacred trust. The age of
puberty had been rashly fixed by the civilians at fourteen; <a href="#note-1361" name="noteref-1361"><small>1361</small></a> but
as the faculties of the mind ripen more slowly than those of the body,
a curator was interposed to guard the fortunes of a Roman youth from his
own inexperience and headstrong passions. Such a trustee had been first
instituted by the praetor, to save a family from the blind havoc of a
prodigal or madman; and the minor was compelled, by the laws, to solicit
the same protection, to give validity to his acts till he accomplished
the full period of twenty-five years. Women were condemned to the
perpetual tutelage of parents, husbands, or guardians; a sex created to
please and obey was never supposed to have attained the age of reason
and experience. Such, at least, was the stern and haughty spirit of
the ancient law, which had been insensibly mollified before the time of
Justinian.

II. The original right of property can only be justified by the accident
or merit of prior occupancy; and on this foundation it is wisely
established by the philosophy of the civilians. <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a> The savage who
hollows a tree, inserts a sharp stone into a wooden handle, or applies
a string to an elastic branch, becomes in a state of nature the just
proprietor of the canoe, the bow, or the hatchet. The materials
were common to all, the new form, the produce of his time and simple
industry, belongs solely to himself. His hungry brethren cannot, without
a sense of their own injustice, extort from the hunter the game of the
forest overtaken or slain by his personal strength and dexterity. If his
provident care preserves and multiplies the tame animals, whose nature
is tractable to the arts of education, he acquires a perpetual title
to the use and service of their numerous progeny, which derives its
existence from him alone. If he encloses and cultivates a field for
their sustenance and his own, a barren waste is converted into a fertile
soil; the seed, the manure, the labor, create a new value, and the
rewards of harvest are painfully earned by the fatigues of the revolving
year. In the successive states of society, the hunter, the shepherd, the
husbandman, may defend their possessions by two reasons which forcibly
appeal to the feelings of the human mind: that whatever they enjoy is
the fruit of their own industry; and that every man who envies their
felicity, may purchase similar acquisitions by the exercise of similar
diligence. Such, in truth, may be the freedom and plenty of a small
colony cast on a fruitful island. But the colony multiplies, while the
space still continues the same; the common rights, the equal inheritance
of mankind. are engrossed by the bold and crafty; each field and forest
is circumscribed by the landmarks of a jealous master; and it is the
peculiar praise of the Roman jurisprudence, that i asserts the claim of
the first occupant to the wild animals of the earth, the air, and the
waters. In the progress from primitive equity to final injustice, the
steps are silent, the shades are almost imperceptible, and the absolute
monopoly is guarded by positive laws and artificial reason. The active,
insatiate principle of self-love can alone supply the arts of life and
the wages of industry; and as soon as civil government and exclusive
property have been introduced, they become necessary to the existence
of the human race. Except in the singular institutions of Sparta, the
wisest legislators have disapproved an agrarian law as a false and
dangerous innovation. Among the Romans, the enormous disproportion of
wealth surmounted the ideal restraints of a doubtful tradition, and an
obsolete statute; a tradition that the poorest follower of Romulus
had been endowed with the perpetual inheritance of two jugera; <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a>
a statute which confined the richest citizen to the measure of five
hundred jugera, or three hundred and twelve acres of land. The original
territory of Rome consisted only of some miles of wood and meadow along
the banks of the Tyber; and domestic exchange could add nothing to the
national stock. But the goods of an alien or enemy were lawfully exposed
to the first hostile occupier; the city was enriched by the profitable
trade of war; and the blood of her sons was the only price that was paid
for the Volscian sheep, the slaves of Briton, or the gems and gold of
Asiatic kingdoms. In the language of ancient jurisprudence, which was
corrupted and forgotten before the age of Justinian, these spoils were
distinguished by the name of manceps or manicipium, taken with the hand;
and whenever they were sold or emancipated, the purchaser required some
assurance that they had been the property of an enemy, and not of
a fellow-citizen. <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a> A citizen could only forfeit his rights by
apparent dereliction, and such dereliction of a valuable interest
could not easily be presumed. Yet, according to the Twelve Tables, a
prescription of one year for movables, and of two years for immovables,
abolished the claim of the ancient master, if the actual possessor had
acquired them by a fair transaction from the person whom he believed to
be the lawful proprietor. <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a> Such conscientious injustice, without
any mixture of fraud or force could seldom injure the members of a small
republic; but the various periods of three, of ten, or of twenty years,
determined by Justinian, are more suitable to the latitude of a great
empire. It is only in the term of prescription that the distinction of
real and personal fortune has been remarked by the civilians; and
their general idea of property is that of simple, uniform, and absolute
dominion. The subordinate exceptions of use, of usufruct, <a href="#note-141" name="noteref-141"><small>141</small></a> of
servitude, <a href="#note-142" name="noteref-142"><small>142</small></a> imposed for the benefit of a neighbor on lands and
houses, are abundantly explained by the professors of jurisprudence.
The claims of property, as far as they are altered by the mixture, the
division, or the transformation of substances, are investigated with
metaphysical subtilty by the same civilians.

[ From this short prescription, Hume (Essays, vol. i. p.
423) infers that there could not then be more order and settlement in
Italy than now amongst the Tartars. By the civilian of his adversary
Wallace, he is reproached, and not without reason, for overlooking the
conditions, (Institut. l. ii. tit. vi.) * Note: Gibbon acknowledges,
in the former note, the obscurity of his views with regard to the res
mancipi. The interpreters, who preceded him, are not agreed on
this point, one of the most difficult in the ancient Roman law. The
conclusions of Hume, of which the author here speaks, are grounded
on false assumptions. Gibbon had conceived very inaccurate notions of
Property among the Romans, and those of many authors in the present day
are not less erroneous. We think it right, in this place, to develop the
system of property among the Romans, as the result of the study of
the extant original authorities on the ancient law, and as it has been
demonstrated, recognized, and adopted by the most learned expositors
of the Roman law. Besides the authorities formerly known, such as the
Fragments of Ulpian, t. xix. and t. i. 16. Theoph. Paraph. i. 5, 4, may
be consulted the Institutes of Gaius, i. 54, and ii. 40, et seq.
The Roman laws protected all property acquired in a lawful manner.
They imposed on those who had invaded it, the obligation of making
restitution and reparation of all damage caused by that invasion; they
punished it moreover, in many cases, by a pecuniary fine. But they did
not always grant a recovery against the third person, who had become
bona fide possessed of the property. He who had obtained possession of a
thing belonging to another, knowing nothing of the prior rights of that
person, maintained the possession. The law had expressly determined
those cases, in which it permitted property to be reclaimed from an
innocent possessor. In these cases possession had the characters of
absolute proprietorship, called mancipium, jus Quiritium. To possess
this right, it was not sufficient to have entered into possession of the
thing in any manner; the acquisition was bound to have that character
of publicity, which was given by the observation of solemn forms,
prescribed by the laws, or the uninterrupted exercise of proprietorship
during a certain time: the Roman citizen alone could acquire this
proprietorship. Every other kind of possession, which might be named
imperfect proprietorship, was called "in bonis habere." It was not till
after the time of Cicero that the general name of Dominium was given to
all proprietorship.
It was then the publicity which constituted the distinctive character
of absolute dominion. This publicity was grounded on the mode of
acquisition, which the moderns have called Civil, (Modi adquirendi
Civiles.) These modes of acquisition were,
1. Mancipium or mancipatio, which was nothing but the solemn delivering
over of the thing in the presence of a determinate number of witnesses
and a public officer; it was from this probably that proprietorship was
named, 2. In jure cessio, which was a solemn delivering over before the
praetor. 3. Adjudicatio, made by a judge, in a case of partition.
4. Lex, which comprehended modes of acquiring in particular cases
determined by law; probably the law of the xii. tables; for instance,
the sub corona emptio and the legatum.
5. Usna, called afterwards usacapio, and by the moderns prescription.
This was only a year for movables; two years for things not movable. Its
primary object was altogether different from that of prescription in
the present day. It was originally introduced in order to transform
the simple possession of a thing (in bonis habere) into Roman
proprietorship. The public and uninterrupted possession of a thing,
enjoyed for the space of one or two years, was sufficient to make known
to the inhabitants of the city of Rome to whom the thing belonged. This
last mode of acquisition completed the system of civil acquisitions. by
legalizing. as it were, every other kind of acquisition which was not
conferred, from the commencement, by the Jus Quiritium. V. Ulpian.
Fragm. i. 16. Gaius, ii. 14. We believe, according to Gaius, 43, that
this usucaption was extended to the case where a thing had been acquired
from a person not the real proprietor; and that according to the time
prescribed, it gave to the possessor the Roman proprietorship. But this
does not appear to have been the original design of this Institution.
Caeterum etiam earum rerum usucapio nobis competit, quae non a domino
nobis tradita fuerint, si modo eas bona fide acceperimus Gaius, l ii.
43. As to things of smaller value, or those which it was difficult to
distinguish from each other, the solemnities of which we speak were not
requisite to obtain legal proprietorship.
In this case simple delivery was sufficient.
In proportion to the aggrandizement of the Republic, this latter
principle became more important from the increase of the commerce and
wealth of the state. It was necessary to know what were those things of
which absolute property might be acquired by simple delivery, and what,
on the contrary, those, the acquisition of which must be sanctioned
by these solemnities. This question was necessarily to be decided by
a general rule; and it is this rule which establishes the distinction
between res mancipi and nec mancipi, a distinction about which the
opinions of modern civilians differ so much that there are above ten
conflicting systems on the subject. The system which accords best with a
sound interpretation of the Roman laws, is that proposed by M. Trekel of
Hamburg, and still further developed by M. Hugo, who has extracted it in
the Magazine of Civil Law, vol. ii. p. 7.
This is the system now almost universally adopted. Res mancipi (by
contraction for mancipii) were things of which the absolute property
(Jus Quiritium) might be acquired only by the solemnities mentioned
above, at least by that of mancipation, which was, without doubt, the
most easy and the most usual. Gaius, ii. 25. As for other things, the
acquisition of which was not subject to these forms, in order to confer
absolute right, they were called res nec mancipi. See Ulpian, Fragm.
xix. 1. 3, 7.
Ulpian and Varro enumerate the different kinds of res mancipi. Their
enumerations do not quite agree; and various methods of reconciling them
have been attempted. The authority of Ulpian, however, who wrote as a
civilian, ought to have the greater weight on this subject.
But why are these things alone res mancipi? This is one of the questions
which have been most frequently agitated, and on which the opinions of
civilians are most divided. M. Hugo has resolved it in the most
natural and satisfactory manner. "All things which were easily known
individually, which were of great value, with which the Romans were
acquainted, and which they highly appreciated, were res mancipi. Of old
mancipation or some other solemn form was required for the acquisition
of these things, an account of their importance. Mancipation served to
prove their acquisition, because they were easily distinguished one from
the other." On this great historical discussion consult the Magazine of
Civil Law by M. Hugo, vol. ii. p. 37, 38; the dissertation of M. J. M.
Zachariae, de Rebus Mancipi et nec Mancipi Conjecturae, p. 11. Lipsiae,
1807; the History of Civil Law by M. Hugo; and my Institutiones Juris
Romani Privati p. 108, 110.
As a general rule, it may be said that all things are res nec mancipi;
the res mancipi are the exception to this principle.
The praetors changed the system of property by allowing a person, who
had a thing in bonis, the right to recover before the prescribed term
of usucaption had conferred absolute proprietorship. (Pauliana in rem
actio.) Justinian went still further, in times when there was no longer
any distinction between a Roman citizen and a stranger. He granted the
right of recovering all things which had been acquired, whether by what
were called civil or natural modes of acquisition, Cod. l. vii. t. 25,
31. And he so altered the theory of Gaius in his Institutes, ii. 1, that
no trace remains of the doctrine taught by that civilian.&mdash;W.]

The personal title of the first proprietor must be determined by
his death: but the possession, without any appearance of change, is
peaceably continued in his children, the associates of his toil, and the
partners of his wealth. This natural inheritance has been protected by
the legislators of every climate and age, and the father is encouraged
to persevere in slow and distant improvements, by the tender hope, that
a long posterity will enjoy the fruits of his labor. The principle of
hereditary succession is universal; but the order has been variously
established by convenience or caprice, by the spirit of national
institutions, or by some partial example which was originally decided
by fraud or violence. The jurisprudence of the Romans appear to have
deviated from the inequality of nature much less than the Jewish, <a href="#note-143" name="noteref-143"><small>143</small></a>
the Athenian, <a href="#note-144" name="noteref-144"><small>144</small></a> or the English institutions. <a href="#note-145" name="noteref-145"><small>145</small></a> On the death of
a citizen, all his descendants, unless they were already freed from his
paternal power, were called to the inheritance of his possessions. The
insolent prerogative of primogeniture was unknown; the two sexes were
placed on a just level; all the sons and daughters were entitled to an
equal portion of the patrimonial estate; and if any of the sons had been
intercepted by a premature death, his person was represented, and his
share was divided, by his surviving children. On the failure of the
direct line, the right of succession must diverge to the collateral
branches. The degrees of kindred <a href="#note-146" name="noteref-146"><small>146</small></a> are numbered by the civilians,
ascending from the last possessor to a common parent, and descending
from the common parent to the next heir: my father stands in the first
degree, my brother in the second, his children in the third, and the
remainder of the series may be conceived by a fancy, or pictured in
a genealogical table. In this computation, a distinction was made,
essential to the laws and even the constitution of Rome; the agnats, or
persons connected by a line of males, were called, as they stood in the
nearest degree, to an equal partition; but a female was incapable of
transmitting any legal claims; and the cognats of every rank, without
excepting the dear relation of a mother and a son, were disinherited by
the Twelve Tables, as strangers and aliens. Among the Romans agens or
lineage was united by a common name and domestic rites; the various
cognomens or surnames of Scipio, or Marcellus, distinguished from each
other the subordinate branches or families of the Cornelian or Claudian
race: the default of the agnats, of the same surname, was supplied
by the larger denomination of gentiles; and the vigilance of the laws
maintained, in the same name, the perpetual descent of religion and
property. A similar principle dictated the Voconian law, <a href="#note-147" name="noteref-147"><small>147</small></a> which
abolished the right of female inheritance. As long as virgins were given
or sold in marriage, the adoption of the wife extinguished the hopes of
the daughter. But the equal succession of independent matrons supported
their pride and luxury, and might transport into a foreign house the
riches of their fathers.

<p>
While the maxims of Cato <a href="#note-148" name="noteref-148"><small>148</small></a> were revered, they tended to perpetuate
in each family a just and virtuous mediocrity: till female blandishments
insensibly triumphed; and every salutary restraint was lost in the
dissolute greatness of the republic. The rigor of the decemvirs was
tempered by the equity of the praetors. Their edicts restored and
emancipated posthumous children to the rights of nature; and upon the
failure of the agnats, they preferred the blood of the cognats to the
name of the gentiles whose title and character were insensibly covered
with oblivion. The reciprocal inheritance of mothers and sons was
established in the Tertullian and Orphitian decrees by the humanity of
the senate. A new and more impartial order was introduced by the Novels
of Justinian, who affected to revive the jurisprudence of the Twelve
Tables. The lines of masculine and female kindred were confounded: the
descending, ascending, and collateral series was accurately defined;
and each degree, according tot he proximity of blood and affection,
succeeded to the vacant possessions of a Roman citizen. <a href="#note-149" name="noteref-149"><small>149</small></a>

<p>
The order of succession is regulated by nature, or at least by the
general and permanent reason of the lawgiver: but this order is
frequently violated by the arbitrary and partial wills, which prolong
the dominion of the testator beyond the grave. <a href="#note-150" name="noteref-150"><small>150</small></a> In the simple state
of society, this last use or abuse of the right of property is seldom
indulged: it was introduced at Athens by the laws of Solon; and the
private testaments of the father of a family are authorized by the
Twelve Tables. Before the time of the decemvirs, <a href="#note-151" name="noteref-151"><small>151</small></a> a Roman citizen
exposed his wishes and motives to the assembly of the thirty curiae
or parishes, and the general law of inheritance was suspended by
an occasional act of the legislature. After the permission of the
decemvirs, each private lawgiver promulgated his verbal or written
testament in the presence of five citizens, who represented the five
classes of the Roman people; a sixth witness attested their concurrence;
a seventh weighed the copper money, which was paid by an imaginary
purchaser; and the estate was emancipated by a fictitious sale and
immediate release. This singular ceremony, <a href="#note-152" name="noteref-152"><small>152</small></a> which excited the
wonder of the Greeks, was still practised in the age of Severus; but the
praetors had already approved a more simple testament, for which they
required the seals and signatures of seven witnesses, free from all
legal exception, and purposely summoned for the execution of that
important act. A domestic monarch, who reigned over the lives and
fortunes of his children, might distribute their respective shares
according to the degrees of their merit or his affection; his arbitrary
displeasure chastised an unworthy son by the loss of his inheritance,
and the mortifying preference of a stranger. But the experience of
unnatural parents recommended some limitations of their testamentary
powers. A son, or, by the laws of Justinian, even a daughter, could no
longer be disinherited by their silence: they were compelled to name
the criminal, and to specify the offence; and the justice of the emperor
enumerated the sole causes that could justify such a violation of
the first principles of nature and society. <a href="#note-153" name="noteref-153"><small>153</small></a> Unless a legitimate
portion, a fourth part, had been reserved for the children, they were
entitled to institute an action or complaint of inofficious testament;
to suppose that their father's understanding was impaired by sickness
or age; and respectfully to appeal from his rigorous sentence to the
deliberate wisdom of the magistrate. In the Roman jurisprudence, an
essential distinction was admitted between the inheritance and the
legacies. The heirs who succeeded to the entire unity, or to any of the
twelve fractions of the substance of the testator, represented his civil
and religious character, asserted his rights, fulfilled his obligations,
and discharged the gifts of friendship or liberality, which his last
will had bequeathed under the name of legacies. But as the imprudence or
prodigality of a dying man might exhaust the inheritance, and leave
only risk and labor to his successor, he was empowered to retain the
Falcidian portion; to deduct, before the payment of the legacies, a
clear fourth for his own emolument. A reasonable time was allowed to
examine the proportion between the debts and the estate, to decide
whether he should accept or refuse the testament; and if he used the
benefit of an inventory, the demands of the creditors could not exceed
the valuation of the effects. The last will of a citizen might be
altered during his life, or rescinded after his death: the persons whom
he named might die before him, or reject the inheritance, or be exposed
to some legal disqualification. In the contemplation of these events,
he was permitted to substitute second and third heirs, to replace each
other according to the order of the testament; and the incapacity of
a madman or an infant to bequeath his property might be supplied by a
similar substitution. <a href="#note-154" name="noteref-154"><small>154</small></a> But the power of the testator expired with
the acceptance of the testament: each Roman of mature age and discretion
acquired the absolute dominion of his inheritance, and the simplicity of
the civil law was never clouded by the long and intricate entails which
confine the happiness and freedom of unborn generations.

declamatory law.]
</p>
<p>
Conquest and the formalities of law established the use of codicils. If
a Roman was surprised by death in a remote province of the empire, he
addressed a short epistle to his legitimate or testamentary heir; who
fulfilled with honor, or neglected with impunity, this last request,
which the judges before the age of Augustus were not authorized to
enforce. A codicil might be expressed in any mode, or in any language;
but the subscription of five witnesses must declare that it was the
genuine composition of the author. His intention, however laudable, was
sometimes illegal; and the invention of fidei-commissa, or trusts, arose
form the struggle between natural justice and positive jurisprudence.
A stranger of Greece or Africa might be the friend or benefactor of a
childless Roman, but none, except a fellow-citizen, could act as his
heir. The Voconian law, which abolished female succession, restrained
the legacy or inheritance of a woman to the sum of one hundred thousand
sesterces; <a href="#note-155" name="noteref-155"><small>155</small></a> and an only daughter was condemned almost as an alien
in her father's house. The zeal of friendship, and parental affection,
suggested a liberal artifice: a qualified citizen was named in the
testament, with a prayer or injunction that he would restore the
inheritance to the person for whom it was truly intended. Various was
the conduct of the trustees in this painful situation: they had sworn
to observe the laws of their country, but honor prompted them to violate
their oath; and if they preferred their interest under the mask of
patriotism, they forfeited the esteem of every virtuous mind. The
declaration of Augustus relieved their doubts, gave a legal sanction to
confidential testaments and codicils, and gently unravelled the forms
and restraints of the republican jurisprudence. <a href="#note-156" name="noteref-156"><small>156</small></a> But as the new
practice of trusts degenerated into some abuse, the trustee was enabled,
by the Trebellian and Pegasian decrees, to reserve one fourth of the
estate, or to transfer on the head of the real heir all the debts and
actions of the succession. The interpretation of testaments was strict
and literal; but the language of trusts and codicils was delivered from
the minute and technical accuracy of the civilians. <a href="#note-157" name="noteref-157"><small>157</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.&mdash;Part VII.
</h2>
<p>
1. The goddess of faith (of human and social faith) was worshipped, not
only in her temples, but in the lives of the Romans; and if that
nation was deficient in the more amiable qualities of benevolence and
generosity, they astonished the Greeks by their sincere and simple
performance of the most burdensome engagements. <a href="#note-159" name="noteref-159"><small>159</small></a> Yet among the same
people, according to the rigid maxims of the patricians and decemvirs,
a naked pact, a promise, or even an oath, did not create any civil
obligation, unless it was confirmed by the legal form of a stipulation.
Whatever might be the etymology of the Latin word, it conveyed the idea
of a firm and irrevocable contract, which was always expressed in the
mode of a question and answer. Do you promise to pay me one hundred
pieces of gold? was the solemn interrogation of Seius. I do promise, was
the reply of Sempronius. The friends of Sempronius, who answered for
his ability and inclination, might be separately sued at the option of
Seius; and the benefit of partition, or order of reciprocal actions,
insensibly deviated from the strict theory of stipulation. The most
cautious and deliberate consent was justly required to sustain the
validity of a gratuitous promise; and the citizen who might have
obtained a legal security, incurred the suspicion of fraud, and paid the
forfeit of his neglect. But the ingenuity of the civilians successfully
labored to convert simple engagements into the form of solemn
stipulations. The praetors, as the guardians of social faith, admitted
every rational evidence of a voluntary and deliberate act, which in
their tribunal produced an equitable obligation, and for which they gave
an action and a remedy. <a href="#note-160" name="noteref-160"><small>160</small></a>

and Brandenburg, in the beginning of the present century, appear to have
studied the civil law on the most just and liberal principles. * Note:
Simple agreements (pacta) formed as valid an obligation as a solemn
contract. Only an action, or the right to a direct judicial prosecution,
was not permitted in every case of compact. In all other respects, the
judge was bound to maintain an agreement made by pactum. The stipulation
was a form common to every kind of agreement, by which the right of
action was given to this.&mdash;W.]
</p>
<p>
2. The obligations of the second class, as they were contracted by the
delivery of a thing, are marked by the civilians with the epithet of
real. <a href="#note-161" name="noteref-161"><small>161</small></a> A grateful return is due to the author of a benefit; and
whoever is intrusted with the property of another, has bound himself
to the sacred duty of restitution. In the case of a friendly loan, the
merit of generosity is on the side of the lender only; in a deposit, on
the side of the receiver; but in a pledge, and the rest of the selfish
commerce of ordinary life, the benefit is compensated by an equivalent,
and the obligation to restore is variously modified by the nature of the
transaction. The Latin language very happily expresses the fundamental
difference between the commodatum and the mutuum, which our poverty is
reduced to confound under the vague and common appellation of a loan.
In the former, the borrower was obliged to restore the same individual
thing with which he had been accommodated for the temporary supply of
his wants; in the latter, it was destined for his use and consumption,
and he discharged this mutual engagement, by substituting the same
specific value according to a just estimation of number, of weight,
and of measure. In the contract of sale, the absolute dominion is
transferred to the purchaser, and he repays the benefit with an adequate
sum of gold or silver, the price and universal standard of all earthly
possessions. The obligation of another contract, that of location, is of
a more complicated kind. Lands or houses, labor or talents, may be hired
for a definite term; at the expiration of the time, the thing itself
must be restored to the owner, with an additional reward for the
beneficial occupation and employment. In these lucrative contracts, to
which may be added those of partnership and commissions, the civilians
sometimes imagine the delivery of the object, and sometimes presume the
consent of the parties. The substantial pledge has been refined into the
invisible rights of a mortgage or hypotheca; and the agreement of sale,
for a certain price, imputes, from that moment, the chances of gain or
loss to the account of the purchaser. It may be fairly supposed, that
every man will obey the dictates of his interest; and if he accepts the
benefit, he is obliged to sustain the expense, of the transaction. In
this boundless subject, the historian will observe the location of land
and money, the rent of the one and the interest of the other, as they
materially affect the prosperity of agriculture and commerce. The
landlord was often obliged to advance the stock and instruments of
husbandry, and to content himself with a partition of the fruits. If the
feeble tenant was oppressed by accident, contagion, or hostile violence,
he claimed a proportionable relief from the equity of the laws: five
years were the customary term, and no solid or costly improvements could
be expected from a farmer, who, at each moment might be ejected by the
sale of the estate. <a href="#note-162" name="noteref-162"><small>162</small></a> Usury, <a href="#note-163" name="noteref-163"><small>163</small></a> the inveterate grievance of the
city, had been discouraged by the Twelve Tables, <a href="#note-164" name="noteref-164"><small>164</small></a> and abolished by
the clamors of the people. It was revived by their wants and idleness,
tolerated by the discretion of the praetors, and finally determined by
the Code of Justinian. Persons of illustrious rank were confined to the
moderate profit of four per cent.; six was pronounced to be the ordinary
and legal standard of interest; eight was allowed for the convenience
of manufactures and merchants; twelve was granted to nautical insurance,
which the wiser ancients had not attempted to define; but, except in
this perilous adventure, the practice of exorbitant usury was severely
restrained. <a href="#note-165" name="noteref-165"><small>165</small></a> The most simple interest was condemned by the clergy
of the East and West; <a href="#note-166" name="noteref-166"><small>166</small></a> but the sense of mutual benefit, which had
triumphed over the law of the republic, has resisted with equal firmness
the decrees of the church, and even the prejudices of mankind. <a href="#note-167" name="noteref-167"><small>167</small></a>

3. Nature and society impose the strict obligation of repairing an
injury; and the sufferer by private injustice acquires a personal right
and a legitimate action. If the property of another be intrusted to our
care, the requisite degree of care may rise and fall according to the
benefit which we derive from such temporary possession; we are seldom
made responsible for inevitable accident, but the consequences of a
voluntary fault must always be imputed to the author. <a href="#note-168" name="noteref-168"><small>168</small></a> A Roman
pursued and recovered his stolen goods by a civil action of theft; they
might pass through a succession of pure and innocent hands, but nothing
less than a prescription of thirty years could extinguish his original
claim. They were restored by the sentence of the praetor, and the injury
was compensated by double, or threefold, or even quadruple damages, as
the deed had been perpetrated by secret fraud or open rapine, as the
robber had been surprised in the fact, or detected by a subsequent
research. The Aquilian law <a href="#note-169" name="noteref-169"><small>169</small></a> defended the living property of a
citizen, his slaves and cattle, from the stroke of malice or negligence:
the highest price was allowed that could be ascribed to the domestic
animal at any moment of the year preceding his death; a similar latitude
of thirty days was granted on the destruction of any other valuable
effects. A personal injury is blunted or sharpened by the manners of the
times and the sensibility of the individual: the pain or the disgrace of
a word or blow cannot easily be appreciated by a pecuniary equivalent.
The rude jurisprudence of the decemvirs had confounded all hasty
insults, which did not amount to the fracture of a limb, by condemning
the aggressor to the common penalty of twenty-five asses. But the same
denomination of money was reduced, in three centuries, from a pound
to the weight of half an ounce: and the insolence of a wealthy Roman
indulged himself in the cheap amusement of breaking and satisfying the
law of the twelve tables. Veratius ran through the streets striking
on the face the inoffensive passengers, and his attendant purse-bearer
immediately silenced their clamors by the legal tender of twenty-five
pieces of copper, about the value of one shilling. <a href="#note-170" name="noteref-170"><small>170</small></a> The equity
of the praetors examined and estimated the distinct merits of each
particular complaint. In the adjudication of civil damages, the
magistrate assumed a right to consider the various circumstances of
time and place, of age and dignity, which may aggravate the shame and
sufferings of the injured person; but if he admitted the idea of a fine,
a punishment, an example, he invaded the province, though, perhaps, he
supplied the defects, of the criminal law.

The execution of the Alban dictator, who was dismembered by eight

Roman cruelty in the punishment of the most atrocious crimes. <a href="#note-171" name="noteref-171"><small>171</small></a> But
this act of justice, or revenge, was inflicted on a foreign enemy in the
heat of victory, and at the command of a single man. The twelve tables
afford a more decisive proof of the national spirit, since they were
framed by the wisest of the senate, and accepted by the free voices
of the people; yet these laws, like the statutes of Draco, <a href="#note-172" name="noteref-172"><small>172</small></a> are
written in characters of blood. <a href="#note-173" name="noteref-173"><small>173</small></a> They approve the inhuman and
unequal principle of retaliation; and the forfeit of an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth, a limb for a limb, is rigorously exacted, unless
the offender can redeem his pardon by a fine of three hundred pounds
of copper. The decemvirs distributed with much liberality the slighter
chastisements of flagellation and servitude; and nine crimes of a very
different complexion are adjudged worthy of death.
</p>
<p>
1. Any act of treason against the state, or of correspondence with the
public enemy. The mode of execution was painful and ignominious: the
head of the degenerate Roman was shrouded in a veil, his hands were tied
behind his back, and after he had been scourged by the lictor, he was
suspended in the midst of the forum on a cross, or inauspicious tree.
</p>
<p>
2. Nocturnal meetings in the city; whatever might be the pretence, of
pleasure, or religion, or the public good.
</p>
<p>
3. The murder of a citizen; for which the common feelings of mankind
demand the blood of the murderer. Poison is still more odious than the
sword or dagger; and we are surprised to discover, in two flagitious
events, how early such subtle wickedness had infected the simplicity
of the republic, and the chaste virtues of the Roman matrons. <a href="#note-174" name="noteref-174"><small>174</small></a> The
parricide, who violated the duties of nature and gratitude, was cast
into the river or the sea, enclosed in a sack; and a cock, a viper,
a dog, and a monkey, were successively added, as the most suitable
companions. <a href="#note-175" name="noteref-175"><small>175</small></a> Italy produces no monkeys; but the want could never be
felt, till the middle of the sixth century first revealed the guilt of a
parricide. <a href="#note-176" name="noteref-176"><small>176</small></a>
</p>
<p>
4. The malice of an incendiary. After the previous ceremony of whipping,
he himself was delivered to the flames; and in this example alone our
reason is tempted to applaud the justice of retaliation.
</p>
<p>
5. Judicial perjury. The corrupt or malicious witness was thrown
headlong from the Tarpeian rock, to expiate his falsehood, which was
rendered still more fatal by the severity of the penal laws, and the
deficiency of written evidence.
</p>
<p>
6. The corruption of a judge, who accepted bribes to pronounce an
iniquitous sentence.
</p>
<p>
7. Libels and satires, whose rude strains sometimes disturbed the
peace of an illiterate city. The author was beaten with clubs, a worthy
chastisement, but it is not certain that he was left to expire under the
blows of the executioner. <a href="#note-177" name="noteref-177"><small>177</small></a>
</p>
<p>
8. The nocturnal mischief of damaging or destroying a neighbor's corn.
The criminal was suspended as a grateful victim to Ceres. But the sylvan
deities were less implacable, and the extirpation of a more valuable
tree was compensated by the moderate fine of twenty-five pounds of
copper.
</p>
<p>
9. Magical incantations; which had power, in the opinion of the Latin
shepherds, to exhaust the strength of an enemy, to extinguish his life,
and to remove from their seats his deep-rooted plantations.
</p>
<p>
The cruelty of the twelve tables against insolvent debtors still remains
to be told; and I shall dare to prefer the literal sense of antiquity
to the specious refinements of modern criticism. <a href="#note-178" name="noteref-178"><small>178</small></a> <a href="#note-1781" name="noteref-1781"><small>1781</small></a> After
the judicial proof or confession of the debt, thirty days of grace
were allowed before a Roman was delivered into the power of his
fellow-citizen. In this private prison, twelve ounces of rice were his
daily food; he might be bound with a chain of fifteen pounds weight;
and his misery was thrice exposed in the market place, to solicit the
compassion of his friends and countrymen. At the expiration of sixty
days, the debt was discharged by the loss of liberty or life; the
insolvent debtor was either put to death, or sold in foreign slavery
beyond the Tyber: but, if several creditors were alike obstinate and
unrelenting, they might legally dismember his body, and satiate their
revenge by this horrid partition. The advocates for this savage law have
insisted, that it must strongly operate in deterring idleness and
fraud from contracting debts which they were unable to discharge; but
experience would dissipate this salutary terror, by proving that no
creditor could be found to exact this unprofitable penalty of life or
limb. As the manners of Rome were insensibly polished, the criminal code
of the decemvirs was abolished by the humanity of accusers, witnesses,
and judges; and impunity became the consequence of immoderate rigor. The
Porcian and Valerian laws prohibited the magistrates from inflicting
on a free citizen any capital, or even corporal, punishment; and the
obsolete statutes of blood were artfully, and perhaps truly, ascribed to
the spirit, not of patrician, but of regal, tyranny.

<p>
In the absence of penal laws, and the insufficiency of civil actions,
the peace and justice of the city were imperfectly maintained by the
private jurisdiction of the citizens. The malefactors who replenish our
jails are the outcasts of society, and the crimes for which they suffer
may be commonly ascribed to ignorance, poverty, and brutal appetite. For
the perpetration of similar enormities, a vile plebeian might claim
and abuse the sacred character of a member of the republic: but, on the
proof or suspicion of guilt, the slave, or the stranger, was nailed to
a cross; and this strict and summary justice might be exercised without
restraint over the greatest part of the populace of Rome.
</p>
<p>
Each family contained a domestic tribunal, which was not confined, like
that of the praetor, to the cognizance of external actions: virtuous
principles and habits were inculcated by the discipline of education;
and the Roman father was accountable to the state for the manners of
his children, since he disposed, without appeal, of their life, their
liberty, and their inheritance. In some pressing emergencies, the
citizen was authorized to avenge his private or public wrongs. The
consent of the Jewish, the Athenian, and the Roman laws approved the
slaughter of the nocturnal thief; though in open daylight a robber could
not be slain without some previous evidence of danger and complaint.
Whoever surprised an adulterer in his nuptial bed might freely exercise
his revenge; <a href="#note-179" name="noteref-179"><small>179</small></a> the most bloody and wanton outrage was excused by
the provocation; <a href="#note-180" name="noteref-180"><small>180</small></a> nor was it before the reign of Augustus that
the husband was reduced to weigh the rank of the offender, or that the
parent was condemned to sacrifice his daughter with her guilty seducer.
After the expulsion of the kings, the ambitious Roman, who should dare
to assume their title or imitate their tyranny, was devoted to the
infernal gods: each of his fellow-citizens was armed with the sword
of justice; and the act of Brutus, however repugnant to gratitude or
prudence, had been already sanctified by the judgment of his country.
<a href="#note-181" name="noteref-181"><small>181</small></a> The barbarous practice of wearing arms in the midst of peace,
<a href="#note-182" name="noteref-182"><small>182</small></a> and the bloody maxims of honor, were unknown to the Romans; and,
during the two purest ages, from the establishment of equal freedom to
the end of the Punic wars, the city was never disturbed by sedition,
and rarely polluted with atrocious crimes. The failure of penal laws was
more sensibly felt, when every vice was inflamed by faction at home and
dominion abroad. In the time of Cicero, each private citizen enjoyed the
privilege of anarchy; each minister of the republic was exalted to
the temptations of regal power, and their virtues are entitled to the
warmest praise, as the spontaneous fruits of nature or philosophy. After
a triennial indulgence of lust, rapine, and cruelty, Verres, the tyrant
of Sicily, could only be sued for the pecuniary restitution of three
hundred thousand pounds sterling; and such was the temper of the laws,
the judges, and perhaps the accuser himself, <a href="#note-183" name="noteref-183"><small>183</small></a> that, on refunding

The first imperfect attempt to restore the proportion of crimes and
punishments was made by the dictator Sylla, who, in the midst of his
sanguinary triumph, aspired to restrain the license, rather than
to oppress the liberty, of the Romans. He gloried in the arbitrary
proscription of four thousand seven hundred citizens. <a href="#note-185" name="noteref-185"><small>185</small></a> But, in the
character of a legislator, he respected the prejudices of the times;
and, instead of pronouncing a sentence of death against the robber or
assassin, the general who betrayed an army, or the magistrate who ruined
a province, Sylla was content to aggravate the pecuniary damages by
the penalty of exile, or, in more constitutional language, by the
interdiction of fire and water. The Cornelian, and afterwards
the Pompeian and Julian, laws introduced a new system of criminal
jurisprudence; <a href="#note-186" name="noteref-186"><small>186</small></a> and the emperors, from Augustus to Justinian,
disguised their increasing rigor under the names of the original
authors. But the invention and frequent use of extraordinary pains
proceeded from the desire to extend and conceal the progress of
despotism. In the condemnation of illustrious Romans, the senate was
always prepared to confound, at the will of their masters, the judicial
and legislative powers. It was the duty of the governors to maintain the
peace of their province, by the arbitrary and rigid administration of
justice; the freedom of the city evaporated in the extent of empire,
and the Spanish malefactor, who claimed the privilege of a Roman, was
elevated by the command of Galba on a fairer and more lofty cross. <a href="#note-187" name="noteref-187"><small>187</small></a>
Occasional rescripts issued from the throne to decide the questions
which, by their novelty or importance, appeared to surpass the authority
and discernment of a proconsul. Transportation and beheading were
reserved for honorable persons; meaner criminals were either hanged,
or burnt, or buried in the mines, or exposed to the wild beasts of the
amphitheatre. Armed robbers were pursued and extirpated as the enemies
of society; the driving away horses or cattle was made a capital
offence; <a href="#note-188" name="noteref-188"><small>188</small></a> but simple theft was uniformly considered as a mere civil
and private injury. The degrees of guilt, and the modes of punishment,
were too often determined by the discretion of the rulers, and the
subject was left in ignorance of the legal danger which he might incur
by every action of his life.

</p>
<p>
A sin, a vice, a crime, are the objects of theology, ethics, and
jurisprudence. Whenever their judgments agree, they corroborate each
other; but, as often as they differ, a prudent legislator appreciates
the guilt and punishment according to the measure of social injury. On
this principle, the most daring attack on the life and property of a
private citizen is judged less atrocious than the crime of treason or
rebellion, which invades the majesty of the republic: the obsequious
civilians unanimously pronounced, that the republic is contained in the
person of its chief; and the edge of the Julian law was sharpened by
the incessant diligence of the emperors. The licentious commerce of the
sexes may be tolerated as an impulse of nature, or forbidden as a source
of disorder and corruption; but the fame, the fortunes, the family of
the husband, are seriously injured by the adultery of the wife. The
wisdom of Augustus, after curbing the freedom of revenge, applied to
this domestic offence the animadversion of the laws: and the guilty
parties, after the payment of heavy forfeitures and fines, were
condemned to long or perpetual exile in two separate islands. <a href="#note-189" name="noteref-189"><small>189</small></a>
Religion pronounces an equal censure against the infidelity of the
husband; but, as it is not accompanied by the same civil effects,
the wife was never permitted to vindicate her wrongs; <a href="#note-190" name="noteref-190"><small>190</small></a> and the
distinction of simple or double adultery, so familiar and so important
in the canon law, is unknown to the jurisprudence of the Code and the
Pandects. I touch with reluctance, and despatch with impatience, a more
odious vice, of which modesty rejects the name, and nature abominates
the idea. The primitive Romans were infected by the example of the
Etruscans <a href="#note-191" name="noteref-191"><small>191</small></a> and Greeks: <a href="#note-192" name="noteref-192"><small>192</small></a> and in the mad abuse of prosperity
and power, every pleasure that is innocent was deemed insipid; and the
Scatinian law, <a href="#note-193" name="noteref-193"><small>193</small></a> which had been extorted by an act of violence,
was insensibly abolished by the lapse of time and the multitude of
criminals. By this law, the rape, perhaps the seduction, of an ingenuous
youth, was compensated, as a personal injury, by the poor damages of ten
thousand sesterces, or fourscore pounds; the ravisher might be slain by
the resistance or revenge of chastity; and I wish to believe, that at
Rome, as in Athens, the voluntary and effeminate deserter of his sex
was degraded from the honors and the rights of a citizen. <a href="#note-194" name="noteref-194"><small>194</small></a> But the
practice of vice was not discouraged by the severity of opinion:
the indelible stain of manhood was confounded with the more venial
transgressions of fornication and adultery, nor was the licentious lover
exposed to the same dishonor which he impressed on the male or female
partner of his guilt. From Catullus to Juvenal, <a href="#note-195" name="noteref-195"><small>195</small></a> the poets accuse
and celebrate the degeneracy of the times; and the reformation of
manners was feebly attempted by the reason and authority of the
civilians till the most virtuous of the Caesars proscribed the sin
against nature as a crime against society. <a href="#note-196" name="noteref-196"><small>196</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.&mdash;Part VIII.
</h2>
<p>
A new spirit of legislation, respectable even in its error, arose in the
empire with the religion of Constantine. <a href="#note-197" name="noteref-197"><small>197</small></a> The laws of Moses were
received as the divine original of justice, and the Christian princes
adapted their penal statutes to the degrees of moral and religious
turpitude. Adultery was first declared to be a capital offence: the
frailty of the sexes was assimilated to poison or assassination, to
sorcery or parricide; the same penalties were inflicted on the passive
and active guilt of paederasty; and all criminals of free or servile
condition were either drowned or beheaded, or cast alive into the
avenging flames. The adulterers were spared by the common sympathy of
mankind; but the lovers of their own sex were pursued by general and
pious indignation: the impure manners of Greece still prevailed in the
cities of Asia, and every vice was fomented by the celibacy of the
monks and clergy. Justinian relaxed the punishment at least of female
infidelity: the guilty spouse was only condemned to solitude and
penance, and at the end of two years she might be recalled to the
arms of a forgiving husband. But the same emperor declared himself the
implacable enemy of unmanly lust, and the cruelty of his persecution can
scarcely be excused by the purity of his motives. <a href="#note-198" name="noteref-198"><small>198</small></a> In defiance
of every principle of justice, he stretched to past as well as future
offences the operations of his edicts, with the previous allowance of a
short respite for confession and pardon. A painful death was inflicted
by the amputation of the sinful instrument, or the insertion of sharp
reeds into the pores and tubes of most exquisite sensibility; and
Justinian defended the propriety of the execution, since the criminals
would have lost their hands, had they been convicted of sacrilege. In
this state of disgrace and agony, two bishops, Isaiah of Rhodes
and Alexander of Diospolis, were dragged through the streets of
Constantinople, while their brethren were admonished, by the voice of a
crier, to observe this awful lesson, and not to pollute the sanctity
of their character. Perhaps these prelates were innocent. A sentence of
death and infamy was often founded on the slight and suspicious evidence
of a child or a servant: the guilt of the green faction, of the
rich, and of the enemies of Theodora, was presumed by the judges, and
paederasty became the crime of those to whom no crime could be imputed.
A French philosopher <a href="#note-199" name="noteref-199"><small>199</small></a> has dared to remark that whatever is secret
must be doubtful, and that our natural horror of vice may be abused as
an engine of tyranny. But the favorable persuasion of the same writer,
that a legislator may confide in the taste and reason of mankind, is
impeached by the unwelcome discovery of the antiquity and extent of the
disease. <a href="#note-200" name="noteref-200"><small>200</small></a>

The free citizens of Athens and Rome enjoyed, in all criminal cases,
the invaluable privilege of being tried by their country. <a href="#note-201" name="noteref-201"><small>201</small></a> 1. The
administration of justice is the most ancient office of a prince: it was
exercised by the Roman kings, and abused by Tarquin; who alone, without
law or council, pronounced his arbitrary judgments. The first consuls
succeeded to this regal prerogative; but the sacred right of appeal soon
abolished the jurisdiction of the magistrates, and all public causes
were decided by the supreme tribunal of the people. But a wild
democracy, superior to the forms, too often disdains the essential
principles, of justice: the pride of despotism was envenomed by plebeian
envy, and the heroes of Athens might sometimes applaud the happiness of
the Persian, whose fate depended on the caprice of a single tyrant. Some
salutary restraints, imposed by the people or their own passions,
were at once the cause and effect of the gravity and temperance of the
Romans. The right of accusation was confined to the magistrates.
</p>
<p>
A vote of the thirty five tribes could inflict a fine; but the
cognizance of all capital crimes was reserved by a fundamental law to
the assembly of the centuries, in which the weight of influence
and property was sure to preponderate. Repeated proclamations and
adjournments were interposed, to allow time for prejudice and resentment
to subside: the whole proceeding might be annulled by a seasonable omen,
or the opposition of a tribune; and such popular trials were commonly
less formidable to innocence than they were favorable to guilt. But this
union of the judicial and legislative powers left it doubtful whether
the accused party was pardoned or acquitted; and, in the defence of
an illustrious client, the orators of Rome and Athens address their
arguments to the policy and benevolence, as well as to the justice, of
their sovereign. 2. The task of convening the citizens for the trial of
each offender became more difficult, as the citizens and the offenders
continually multiplied; and the ready expedient was adopted of
delegating the jurisdiction of the people to the ordinary magistrates,
or to extraordinary inquisitors. In the first ages these questions were
rare and occasional. In the beginning of the seventh century of Rome
they were made perpetual: four praetors were annually empowered to sit
in judgment on the state offences of treason, extortion, peculation, and
bribery; and Sylla added new praetors and new questions for those
crimes which more directly injure the safety of individuals. By these
inquisitors the trial was prepared and directed; but they could only
pronounce the sentence of the majority of judges, who with some truth,
and more prejudice, have been compared to the English juries. <a href="#note-202" name="noteref-202"><small>202</small></a> To
discharge this important, though burdensome office, an annual list of
ancient and respectable citizens was formed by the praetor. After many
constitutional struggles, they were chosen in equal numbers from the
senate, the equestrian order, and the people; four hundred and fifty
were appointed for single questions; and the various rolls or decuries
of judges must have contained the names of some thousand Romans, who
represented the judicial authority of the state. In each particular
cause, a sufficient number was drawn from the urn; their integrity was
guarded by an oath; the mode of ballot secured their independence; the
suspicion of partiality was removed by the mutual challenges of the
accuser and defendant; and the judges of Milo, by the retrenchment of
fifteen on each side, were reduced to fifty-one voices or tablets, of
acquittal, of condemnation, or of favorable doubt. <a href="#note-203" name="noteref-203"><small>203</small></a> 3. In his civil
jurisdiction, the praetor of the city was truly a judge, and almost
a legislator; but, as soon as he had prescribed the action of law, he
often referred to a delegate the determination of the fact. With the
increase of legal proceedings, the tribunal of the centumvirs, in which
he presided, acquired more weight and reputation. But whether he acted
alone, or with the advice of his council, the most absolute powers might
be trusted to a magistrate who was annually chosen by the votes of
the people. The rules and precautions of freedom have required some
explanation; the order of despotism is simple and inanimate. Before the
age of Justinian, or perhaps of Diocletian, the decuries of Roman judges
had sunk to an empty title: the humble advice of the assessors might
be accepted or despised; and in each tribunal the civil and criminal
jurisdiction was administered by a single magistrate, who was raised
and disgraced by the will of the emperor.

A Roman accused of any capital crime might prevent the sentence of
the law by voluntary exile, or death. Till his guilt had been legally
proved, his innocence was presumed, and his person was free: till
the votes of the last century had been counted and declared, he might
peaceably secede to any of the allied cities of Italy, or Greece,
or Asia. <a href="#note-204" name="noteref-204"><small>204</small></a> His fame and fortunes were preserved, at least to his
children, by this civil death; and he might still be happy in every
rational and sensual enjoyment, if a mind accustomed to the ambitious
tumult of Rome could support the uniformity and silence of Rhodes or
Athens. A bolder effort was required to escape from the tyranny of the
Caesars; but this effort was rendered familiar by the maxims of the
stoics, the example of the bravest Romans, and the legal encouragements
of suicide. The bodies of condemned criminals were exposed to public
ignominy, and their children, a more serious evil, were reduced to
poverty by the confiscation of their fortunes. But, if the victims of
Tiberius and Nero anticipated the decree of the prince or senate, their
courage and despatch were recompensed by the applause of the public, the
decent honors of burial, and the validity of their testaments. <a href="#note-205" name="noteref-205"><small>205</small></a> The
exquisite avarice and cruelty of Domitian appear to have deprived the
unfortunate of this last consolation, and it was still denied even by
the clemency of the Antonines. A voluntary death, which, in the case of
a capital offence, intervened between the accusation and the sentence,
was admitted as a confession of guilt, and the spoils of the deceased
were seized by the inhuman claims of the treasury. <a href="#note-206" name="noteref-206"><small>206</small></a> Yet the
civilians have always respected the natural right of a citizen to
dispose of his life; and the posthumous disgrace invented by Tarquin,
<a href="#note-207" name="noteref-207"><small>207</small></a> to check the despair of his subjects, was never revived or
imitated by succeeding tyrants. The powers of this world have indeed
lost their dominion over him who is resolved on death; and his arm can
only be restrained by the religious apprehension of a future state.
Suicides are enumerated by Virgil among the unfortunate, rather than the
guilty; <a href="#note-208" name="noteref-208"><small>208</small></a> and the poetical fables of the infernal shades could not
seriously influence the faith or practice of mankind. But the precepts
of the gospel, or the church, have at length imposed a pious servitude
on the minds of Christians, and condemn them to expect, without a
murmur, the last stroke of disease or the executioner.

</p>
<p>
The penal statutes form a very small proportion of the sixty-two books
of the Code and Pandects; and in all judicial proceedings, the life or
death of a citizen is determined with less caution or delay than
the most ordinary question of covenant or inheritance. This singular
distinction, though something may be allowed for the urgent necessity of
defending the peace of society, is derived from the nature of criminal
and civil jurisprudence. Our duties to the state are simple and uniform:
the law by which he is condemned is inscribed not only on brass or
marble, but on the conscience of the offender, and his guilt is commonly
proved by the testimony of a single fact. But our relations to each
other are various and infinite; our obligations are created,
annulled, and modified, by injuries, benefits, and promises; and the
interpretation of voluntary contracts and testaments, which are often
dictated by fraud or ignorance, affords a long and laborious exercise
to the sagacity of the judge. The business of life is multiplied by the
extent of commerce and dominion, and the residence of the parties in
the distant provinces of an empire is productive of doubt, delay, and
inevitable appeals from the local to the supreme magistrate. Justinian,
the Greek emperor of Constantinople and the East, was the legal
successor of the Latin shepherd who had planted a colony on the banks
of the Tyber. In a period of thirteen hundred years, the laws had
reluctantly followed the changes of government and manners; and the
laudable desire of conciliating ancient names with recent institutions
destroyed the harmony, and swelled the magnitude, of the obscure and
irregular system. The laws which excuse, on any occasions, the
ignorance of their subjects, confess their own imperfections: the
civil jurisprudence, as it was abridged by Justinian, still continued a
mysterious science, and a profitable trade, and the innate perplexity
of the study was involved in tenfold darkness by the private industry
of the practitioners. The expense of the pursuit sometimes exceeded the
value of the prize, and the fairest rights were abandoned by the poverty
or prudence of the claimants. Such costly justice might tend to abate
the spirit of litigation, but the unequal pressure serves only to
increase the influence of the rich, and to aggravate the misery of the
poor. By these dilatory and expensive proceedings, the wealthy pleader
obtains a more certain advantage than he could hope from the accidental
corruption of his judge. The experience of an abuse, from which our
own age and country are not perfectly exempt, may sometimes provoke
a generous indignation, and extort the hasty wish of exchanging our
elaborate jurisprudence for the simple and summary decrees of a Turkish
cadhi. Our calmer reflection will suggest, that such forms and delays
are necessary to guard the person and property of the citizen; that the
discretion of the judge is the first engine of tyranny; and that the
laws of a free people should foresee and determine every question that
may probably arise in the exercise of power and the transactions of
industry. But the government of Justinian united the evils of liberty
and servitude; and the Romans were oppressed at the same time by the
multiplicity of their laws and the arbitrary will of their master.
