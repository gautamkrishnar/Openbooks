<p>
After the extinction of paganism, the Christians in peace and piety
might have enjoyed their solitary triumph. But the principle of discord
was alive in their bosom, and they were more solicitous to explore the
nature, than to practice the laws, of their founder. I have already
observed, that the disputes of the Trinity were succeeded by those of
the Incarnation; alike scandalous to the church, alike pernicious to the
state, still more minute in their origin, still more durable in their
effects.
</p>
<p>
It is my design to comprise in the present chapter a religious war
of two hundred and fifty years, to represent the ecclesiastical and
political schism of the Oriental sects, and to introduce their clamorous
or sanguinary contests, by a modest inquiry into the doctrines of the
primitive church. <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a>

[ By what means shall I authenticate this previous inquiry,
which I have studied to circumscribe and compress?&mdash;If I persist in
supporting each fact or reflection by its proper and special evidence,
every line would demand a string of testimonies, and every note would
swell to a critical dissertation. But the numberless passages of
antiquity which I have seen with my own eyes, are compiled, digested and
illustrated by Petavius and Le Clerc, by Beausobre and Mosheim. I shall
be content to fortify my narrative by the names and characters of these
respectable guides; and in the contemplation of a minute or remote
object, I am not ashamed to borrow the aid of the strongest glasses: 1.
The Dogmata Theologica of Petavius are a work of incredible labor and
compass; the volumes which relate solely to the Incarnation (two folios,
vth and vith, of 837 pages) are divided into xvi. books&mdash;the first
of history, the remainder of controversy and doctrine. The Jesuit's
learning is copious and correct; his Latinity is pure, his method clear,
his argument profound and well connected; but he is the slave of the
fathers, the scourge of heretics, and the enemy of truth and candor,
as often as they are inimical to the Catholic cause. 2. The Arminian
Le Clerc, who has composed in a quarto volume (Amsterdam, 1716) the
ecclesiastical history of the two first centuries, was free both in his
temper and situation; his sense is clear, but his thoughts are narrow;
he reduces the reason or folly of ages to the standard of his private
judgment, and his impartiality is sometimes quickened, and sometimes
tainted by his opposition to the fathers. See the heretics (Cerinthians,
lxxx. Ebionites, ciii. Carpocratians, cxx. Valentiniins, cxxi.
Basilidians, cxxiii. Marcionites, cxli., &amp;c.) under their proper dates.
3. The Histoire Critique du Manicheisme (Amsterdam, 1734, 1739, in
two vols. in 4to., with a posthumous dissertation sur les Nazarenes,
Lausanne, 1745) of M. de Beausobre is a treasure of ancient philosophy
and theology. The learned historian spins with incomparable art the
systematic thread of opinion, and transforms himself by turns into the
person of a saint, a sage, or a heretic. Yet his refinement is sometimes
excessive; he betrays an amiable partiality in favor of the weaker side,
and, while he guards against calumny, he does not allow sufficient scope
for superstition and fanaticism. A copious table of contents will direct
the reader to any point that he wishes to examine. 4. Less profound than
Petavius, less independent than Le Clerc, less ingenious than Beausobre,
the historian Mosheim is full, rational, correct, and moderate. In his
learned work, De Rebus Christianis ante Constantinum (Helmstadt 1753,
in 4to.,) see the Nazarenes and Ebionites, p. 172&mdash;179, 328&mdash;332. The
Gnostics in general, p. 179, &amp;c. Cerinthus, p. 196&mdash;202. Basilides, p.
352&mdash;361. Carpocrates, p. 363&mdash;367. Valentinus, p. 371&mdash;389 Marcion, p.
404&mdash;410. The Manichaeans, p. 829-837, &amp;c.]
</p>
<p>
I. A laudable regard for the honor of the first proselyte has
countenanced the belief, the hope, the wish, that the Ebionites, or
at least the Nazarenes, were distinguished only by their obstinate
perseverance in the practice of the Mosaic rites.
</p>
<p>
Their churches have disappeared, their books are obliterated: their
obscure freedom might allow a latitude of faith, and the softness of
their infant creed would be variously moulded by the zeal or prudence of
three hundred years. Yet the most charitable criticism must refuse
these sectaries any knowledge of the pure and proper divinity of Christ.
Educated in the school of Jewish prophecy and prejudice, they had never
been taught to elevate their hopes above a human and temporal Messiah.
<a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> If they had courage to hail their king when he appeared in a
plebeian garb, their grosser apprehensions were incapable of discerning
their God, who had studiously disguised his celestial character under
the name and person of a mortal. <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> The familiar companions of Jesus
of Nazareth conversed with their friend and countryman, who, in all the
actions of rational and animal life, appeared of the same species with
themselves. His progress from infancy to youth and manhood was marked by
a regular increase in stature and wisdom; and after a painful agony
of mind and body, he expired on the cross. He lived and died for the
service of mankind: but the life and death of Socrates had likewise been
devoted to the cause of religion and justice; and although the stoic
or the hero may disdain the humble virtues of Jesus, the tears which he
shed over his friend and country may be esteemed the purest evidence of
his humanity. The miracles of the gospel could not astonish a people who
held with intrepid faith the more splendid prodigies of the Mosaic
law. The prophets of ancient days had cured diseases, raised the dead,
divided the sea, stopped the sun, and ascended to heaven in a fiery
chariot. And the metaphorical style of the Hebrews might ascribe to a
saint and martyr the adoptive title of Son of God.

[ Jew Tryphon, (Justin. Dialog. p. 207) in the name of his
countrymen, and the modern Jews, the few who divert their thoughts from
money to religion, still hold the same language, and allege the literal
sense of the prophets. * Note: See on this passage Bp. Kaye, Justin
Martyr, p. 25.&mdash;M. Note: Most of the modern writers, who have closely
examined this subject, and who will not be suspected of any theological
bias, Rosenmuller on Isaiah ix. 5, and on Psalm xlv. 7, and Bertholdt,
Christologia Judaeorum, c. xx., rightly ascribe much higher notions
of the Messiah to the Jews. In fact, the dispute seems to rest on the
notion that there was a definite and authorized notion of the Messiah,
among the Jews, whereas it was probably so vague, as to admit every
shade of difference, from the vulgar expectation of a mere temporal
king, to the philosophic notion of an emanation from the Deity.&mdash;M.]

[ Chrysostom (Basnage, Hist. des Juifs, tom. v. c. 9, p. 183)
and Athanasius (Petav. Dogmat. Theolog. tom. v. l. i. c. 2, p. 3) are
obliged to confess that the Divinity of Christ is rarely mentioned by
himself or his apostles.]
</p>
<p>
Yet in the insufficient creed of the Nazarenes and the Ebionites, a
distinction is faintly noticed between the heretics, who confounded the
generation of Christ in the common order of nature, and the less guilty
schismatics, who revered the virginity of his mother, and excluded the
aid of an earthly father. The incredulity of the former was countenanced
by the visible circumstances of his birth, the legal marriage of the
reputed parents, Joseph and Mary, and his lineal claim to the kingdom of
David and the inheritance of Judah. But the secret and authentic history
has been recorded in several copies of the Gospel according to St.
Matthew, <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> which these sectaries long preserved in the original
Hebrew, <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> as the sole evidence of their faith. The natural suspicions
of the husband, conscious of his own chastity, were dispelled by the
assurance (in a dream) that his wife was pregnant of the Holy Ghost: and
as this distant and domestic prodigy could not fall under the personal
observation of the historian, he must have listened to the same voice
which dictated to Isaiah the future conception of a virgin. The son of
a virgin, generated by the ineffable operation of the Holy Spirit, was a
creature without example or resemblance, superior in every attribute
of mind and body to the children of Adam. Since the introduction of the
Greek or Chaldean philosophy, <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> the Jews <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> were persuaded of the
preexistence, transmigration, and immortality of souls; and providence
was justified by a supposition, that they were confined in their earthly
prisons to expiate the stains which they had contracted in a former
state. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> But the degrees of purity and corruption are almost
immeasurable. It might be fairly presumed, that the most sublime and
virtuous of human spirits was infused into the offspring of Mary and
the Holy Ghost; <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> that his abasement was the result of his voluntary
choice; and that the object of his mission was, to purify, not his
own, but the sins of the world. On his return to his native skies, he
received the immense reward of his obedience; the everlasting kingdom of
the Messiah, which had been darkly foretold by the prophets, under the
carnal images of peace, of conquest, and of dominion. Omnipotence could
enlarge the human faculties of Christ to the extend of is celestial
office. In the language of antiquity, the title of God has not been
severely confined to the first parent, and his incomparable minister,
his only-begotten son, might claim, without presumption, the religious,
though secondary, worship of a subject of a subject world.

[ The two first chapters of St. Matthew did not exist in
the Ebionite copies, (Epiphan. Haeres. xxx. 13;) and the miraculous
conception is one of the last articles which Dr. Priestley has curtailed
from his scanty creed. * Note: The distinct allusion to the facts
related in the two first chapters of the Gospel, in a work evidently
written about the end of the reign of Nero, the Ascensio Isaiae, edited
by Archbishop Lawrence, seems convincing evidence that they are integral
parts of the authentic Christian history.&mdash;M.]

[ It is probable enough that the first of the Gospels for the
use of the Jewish converts was composed in the Hebrew or Syriac idiom:
the fact is attested by a chain of fathers&mdash;Papias, Irenaeus, Origen,
Jerom, &amp;c. It is devoutly believed by the Catholics, and admitted by
Casaubon, Grotius, and Isaac Vossius, among the Protestant critics. But
this Hebrew Gospel of St. Matthew is most unaccountably lost; and we
may accuse the diligence or fidelity of the primitive churches, who have
preferred the unauthorized version of some nameless Greek. Erasmus
and his followers, who respect our Greek text as the original Gospel,
deprive themselves of the evidence which declares it to be the work
of an apostle. See Simon, Hist. Critique, &amp;c., tom. iii. c. 5&mdash;9, p.
47&mdash;101, and the Prolegomena of Mill and Wetstein to the New Testament.
* Note: Surely the extinction of the Judaeo-Christian community related
from Mosheim by Gibbon himself (c. xv.) accounts both simply and
naturally for the loss of a composition, which had become of no
use&mdash;nor does it follow that the Greek Gospel of St. Matthew is
unauthorized.&mdash;M.]

[ Four different opinions have been entertained concerning
the origin of human souls: 1. That they are eternal and divine. 2. That
they were created in a separate state of existence, before their union
with the body. 3. That they have been propagated from the original stock
of Adam, who contained in himself the mental as well as the corporeal
seed of his posterity. 4. That each soul is occasionally created and
embodied in the moment of conception.&mdash;The last of these sentiments
appears to have prevailed among the moderns; and our spiritual history
is grown less sublime, without becoming more intelligible.]

of the Rabbis attribute one and the same soul to the persons of Adam,
David, and the Messiah.]
</p>
<p>
II. The seeds of the faith, which had slowly arisen in the rocky and
ungrateful soil of Judea, were transplanted, in full maturity, to the
happier climes of the Gentiles; and the strangers of Rome or Asia, who
never beheld the manhood, were the more readily disposed to embrace the
divinity, of Christ. The polytheist and the philosopher, the Greek and
the Barbarian, were alike accustomed to conceive a long succession,
an infinite chain of angels or daemons, or deities, or aeons, or
emanations, issuing from the throne of light. Nor could it seem strange
or incredible, that the first of these aeons, the Logos, or Word of God,
of the same substance with the Father, should descend upon earth, to
deliver the human race from vice and error, and to conduct them in
the paths of life and immortality. But the prevailing doctrine of the
eternity and inherent pravity of matter infected the primitive churches
of the East. Many among the Gentile proselytes refused to believe that
a celestial spirit, an undivided portion of the first essence, had been
personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh; and,
in their zeal for the divinity, they piously abjured the humanity, of
Christ. While his blood was still recent on Mount Calvary, <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a>
the Docetes, a numerous and learned sect of Asiatics, invented the
phantastic system, which was afterwards propagated by the Marcionites,
the Manichaeans, and the various names of the Gnostic heresy. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> They
denied the truth and authenticity of the Gospels, as far as they relate
the conception of Mary, the birth of Christ, and the thirty years that
preceded the exercise of his ministry. He first appeared on the banks of
the Jordan in the form of perfect manhood; but it was a form only, and
not a substance; a human figure created by the hand of Omnipotence to
imitate the faculties and actions of a man, and to impose a perpetual
illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies. Articulate sounds
vibrated on the ears of the disciples; but the image which was impressed
on their optic nerve eluded the more stubborn evidence of the touch; and
they enjoyed the spiritual, not the corporeal, presence of the Son of
God. The rage of the Jews was idly wasted against an impassive phantom;
and the mystic scenes of the passion and death, the resurrection and
ascension, of Christ were represented on the theatre of Jerusalem for
the benefit of mankind. If it were urged, that such ideal mimicry,
such incessant deception, was unworthy of the God of truth, the Docetes
agreed with too many of their orthodox brethren in the justification of
pious falsehood. In the system of the Gnostics, the Jehovah of Israel,
the Creator of this lower world, was a rebellious, or at least an
ignorant, spirit. The Son of God descended upon earth to abolish his
temple and his law; and, for the accomplishment of this salutary end, he
dexterously transferred to his own person the hope and prediction of a
temporal Messiah.

[ About the year 200 of the Christian aera, Irenaeus
and Hippolytus efuted the thirty-two sects, which had multiplied to
fourscore in the time of Epiphanius, (Phot. Biblioth. cod. cxx. cxxi.
cxxii.) The five books of Irenaeus exist only in barbarous Latin; but
the original might perhaps be found in some monastery of Greece.]
</p>
<p>
One of the most subtile disputants of the Manichaean school has pressed
the danger and indecency of supposing, that the God of the Christians,
in the state of a human foetus, emerged at the end of nine months from
a female womb. The pious horror of his antagonists provoked them to
disclaim all sensual circumstances of conception and delivery; to
maintain that the divinity passed through Mary like a sunbeam through a
plate of glass; and to assert, that the seal of her virginity remained
unbroken even at the moment when she became the mother of Christ. But
the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of
those of the Docetes, who taught, not that Christ was a phantom, but
that he was clothed with an impassible and incorruptible body.
Such, indeed, in the more orthodox system, he has acquired since his
resurrection, and such he must have always possessed, if it were capable
of pervading, without resistance or injury, the density of intermediate
matter. Devoid of its most essential properties, it might be exempt
from the attributes and infirmities of the flesh. A foetus that could
increase from an invisible point to its full maturity; a child that
could attain the stature of perfect manhood without deriving any
nourishment from the ordinary sources, might continue to exist without
repairing a daily waste by a daily supply of external matter. Jesus
might share the repasts of his disciples without being subject to the
calls of thirst or hunger; and his virgin purity was never sullied
by the involuntary stains of sensual concupiscence. Of a body thus
singularly constituted, a question would arise, by what means, and of
what materials, it was originally framed; and our sounder theology is
startled by an answer which was not peculiar to the Gnostics, that both
the form and the substance proceeded from the divine essence. The idea
of pure and absolute spirit is a refinement of modern philosophy: the
incorporeal essence, ascribed by the ancients to human souls, celestial
beings, and even the Deity himself, does not exclude the notion of
extended space; and their imagination was satisfied with a subtile
nature of air, or fire, or aether, incomparably more perfect than
the grossness of the material world. If we define the place, we must
describe the figure, of the Deity. Our experience, perhaps our vanity,
represents the powers of reason and virtue under a human form. The
Anthropomorphites, who swarmed among the monks of Egypt and the
Catholics of Africa, could produce the express declaration of Scripture,
that man was made after the image of his Creator. <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> The venerable
Serapion, one of the saints of the Nitrian deserts, relinquished, with
many a tear, his darling prejudice; and bewailed, like an infant, his
unlucky conversion, which had stolen away his God, and left his mind
without any visible object of faith or devotion. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a>

scandalized by the anthropomorphism of the vulgar Catholics.]

III. Such were the fleeting shadows of the Docetes. A more substantial,
though less simple, hypothesis, was contrived by Cerinthus of Asia, <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a>
who dared to oppose the last of the apostles. Placed on the confines of
the Jewish and Gentile world, he labored to reconcile the Gnostic with
the Ebionite, by confessing in the same Messiah the supernatural union
of a man and a God; and this mystic doctrine was adopted with many
fanciful improvements by Carpocrates, Basilides, and Valentine, <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> the
heretics of the Egyptian school. In their eyes, Jesus of Nazareth was a
mere mortal, the legitimate son of Joseph and Mary: but he was the
best and wisest of the human race, selected as the worthy instrument to
restore upon earth the worship of the true and supreme Deity. When he
was baptized in the Jordan, the Christ, the first of the aeons, the Son
of God himself, descended on Jesus in the form of a dove, to inhabit his
mind, and direct his actions during the allotted period of his ministry.
When the Messiah was delivered into the hands of the Jews, the Christ,
an immortal and impassible being, forsook his earthly tabernacle, flew
back to the pleroma or world of spirits, and left the solitary Jesus to
suffer, to complain, and to expire. But the justice and generosity of
such a desertion are strongly questionable; and the fate of an innocent
martyr, at first impelled, and at length abandoned, by his divine
companion, might provoke the pity and indignation of the profane.
Their murmurs were variously silenced by the sectaries who espoused and
modified the double system of Cerinthus. It was alleged, that when Jesus
was nailed to the cross, he was endowed with a miraculous apathy of mind
and body, which rendered him insensible of his apparent sufferings.
It was affirmed, that these momentary, though real, pangs would be
abundantly repaid by the temporal reign of a thousand years reserved for
the Messiah in his kingdom of the new Jerusalem. It was insinuated,
that if he suffered, he deserved to suffer; that human nature is never
absolutely perfect; and that the cross and passion might serve to
expiate the venial transgressions of the son of Joseph, before his
mysterious union with the Son of God. <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a>

divine spirit of the Savior. 2. At the time of the passion, they both
retired, and left only a sensitive soul and a human body. 3. Even
that body was aethereal, and perhaps apparent.&mdash;Such are the laborious

IV. All those who believe the immateriality of the soul, a specious
and noble tenet, must confess, from their present experience, the
incomprehensible union of mind and matter. A similar union is not
inconsistent with a much higher, or even with the highest, degree of
mental faculties; and the incarnation of an aeon or archangel, the most
perfect of created spirits, does not involve any positive contradiction
or absurdity. In the age of religious freedom, which was determined
by the council of Nice, the dignity of Christ was measured by private
judgment according to the indefinite rule of Scripture, or reason, or
tradition. But when his pure and proper divinity had been established on
the ruins of Arianism, the faith of the Catholics trembled on the edge
of a precipice where it was impossible to recede, dangerous to stand,
dreadful to fall and the manifold inconveniences of their creed were
aggravated by the sublime character of their theology. They hesitated
to pronounce; that God himself, the second person of an equal and
consubstantial trinity, was manifested in the flesh; <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> that a being
who pervades the universe, had been confined in the womb of Mary; that
his eternal duration had been marked by the days, and months, and years
of human existence; that the Almighty had been scourged and crucified;
that his impassible essence had felt pain and anguish; that his
omniscience was not exempt from ignorance; and that the source of life
and immortality expired on Mount Calvary. These alarming consequences
were affirmed with unblushing simplicity by Apollinaris, <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> bishop of
Laodicea, and one of the luminaries of the church. The son of a learned
grammarian, he was skilled in all the sciences of Greece; eloquence,
erudition, and philosophy, conspicuous in the volumes of Apollinaris,
were humbly devoted to the service of religion. The worthy friend of
Athanasius, the worthy antagonist of Julian, he bravely wrestled
with the Arians and Polytheists, and though he affected the rigor of
geometrical demonstration, his commentaries revealed the literal and
allegorical sense of the Scriptures. A mystery, which had long floated
in the looseness of popular belief, was defined by his perverse
diligence in a technical form; and he first proclaimed the memorable
words, "One incarnate nature of Christ," which are still reechoed with
hostile clamors in the churches of Asia, Egypt, and Aethiopia. He taught
that the Godhead was united or mingled with the body of a man; and
that the Logos, the eternal wisdom, supplied in the flesh the place and
office of a human soul. Yet as the profound doctor had been terrified at
his own rashness, Apollinaris was heard to mutter some faint accents
of excuse and explanation. He acquiesced in the old distinction of the
Greek philosophers between the rational and sensitive soul of man; that
he might reserve the Logos for intellectual functions, and employ the
subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life.
</p>
<p>
With the moderate Docetes, he revered Mary as the spiritual, rather than
as the carnal, mother of Christ, whose body either came from heaven,
impassible and incorruptible, or was absorbed, and as it were
transformed, into the essence of the Deity. The system of Apollinaris
was strenuously encountered by the Asiatic and Syrian divines whose
schools are honored by the names of Basil, Gregory and Chrysostom, and
tainted by those of Diodorus, Theodore, and Nestorius. But the person
of the aged bishop of Laedicea, his character and dignity, remained
inviolate; and his rivals, since we may not suspect them of the weakness
of toleration, were astonished, perhaps, by the novelty of the argument,
and diffident of the final sentence of the Catholic church. Her judgment
at length inclined in their favor; the heresy of Apollinaris was
condemned, and the separate congregations of his disciples were
proscribed by the Imperial laws. But his principles were secretly
entertained in the monasteries of Egypt, and his enemies felt the
hatred of Theophilus and Cyril, the successive patriarchs of Alexandria.

V. The grovelling Ebionite, and the fantastic Docetes, were rejected and
forgotten: the recent zeal against the errors of Apollinaris reduced the
Catholics to a seeming agreement with the double nature of Cerinthus.
But instead of a temporary and occasional alliance, they established,
and we still embrace, the substantial, indissoluble, and everlasting
union of a perfect God with a perfect man, of the second person of the
trinity with a reasonable soul and human flesh. In the beginning of the
fifth century, the unity of the two natures was the prevailing doctrine
of the church. On all sides, it was confessed, that the mode of their
coexistence could neither be represented by our ideas, nor expressed by
our language. Yet a secret and incurable discord was cherished, between
those who were most apprehensive of confounding, and those who were
most fearful of separating, the divinity, and the humanity, of Christ.
Impelled by religious frenzy, they fled with adverse haste from
the error which they mutually deemed most destructive of truth and
salvation. On either hand they were anxious to guard, they were jealous
to defend, the union and the distinction of the two natures, and to
invent such forms of speech, such symbols of doctrine, as were least
susceptible of doubt or ambiguity. The poverty of ideas and language
tempted them to ransack art and nature for every possible comparison,
and each comparison mislead their fancy in the explanation of an
incomparable mystery. In the polemic microscope, an atom is enlarged
to a monster, and each party was skilful to exaggerate the absurd or
impious conclusions that might be extorted from the principles of their
adversaries. To escape from each other, they wandered through many
a dark and devious thicket, till they were astonished by the horrid
phantoms of Cerinthus and Apollinaris, who guarded the opposite issues
of the theological labyrinth. As soon as they beheld the twilight of
sense and heresy, they started, measured back their steps, and were
again involved in the gloom of impenetrable orthodoxy. To purge
themselves from the guilt or reproach of damnable error, they
disavowed their consequences, explained their principles, excused their
indiscretions, and unanimously pronounced the sounds of concord and
faith. Yet a latent and almost invisible spark still lurked among the
embers of controversy: by the breath of prejudice and passion, it was
quickly kindled to a mighty flame, and the verbal disputes <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> of the

The name of Cyril of Alexandria is famous in controversial story,
and the title of saint is a mark that his opinions and his party have
finally prevailed. In the house of his uncle, the archbishop Theophilus,
he imbibed the orthodox lessons of zeal and dominion, and five years of
his youth were profitably spent in the adjacent monasteries of
Nitria. Under the tuition of the abbot Serapion, he applied himself
to ecclesiastical studies, with such indefatigable ardor, that in the
course of one sleepless night, he has perused the four Gospels, the
Catholic Epistles, and the Epistle to the Romans. Origen he detested;
but the writings of Clemens and Dionysius, of Athanasius and Basil, were
continually in his hands: by the theory and practice of dispute, his
faith was confirmed and his wit was sharpened; he extended round his
cell the cobwebs of scholastic theology, and meditated the works of
allegory and metaphysics, whose remains, in seven verbose folios, now
peaceably slumber by the side of their rivals. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> Cyril prayed and
fasted in the desert, but his thoughts (it is the reproach of a friend)
<a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> were still fixed on the world; and the call of Theophilus, who
summoned him to the tumult of cities and synods, was too readily obeyed
by the aspiring hermit. With the approbation of his uncle, he assumed
the office, and acquired the fame, of a popular preacher. His comely
person adorned the pulpit; the harmony of his voice resounded in the
cathedral; his friends were stationed to lead or second the applause of
the congregation; <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> and the hasty notes of the scribes preserved
his discourses, which in their effect, though not in their composition,
might be compared with those of the Athenian orators. The death of
Theophilus expanded and realized the hopes of his nephew. The clergy
of Alexandria was divided; the soldiers and their general supported the
claims of the archdeacon; but a resistless multitude, with voices and
with hands, asserted the cause of their favorite; and after a period of
thirty-nine years, Cyril was seated on the throne of Athanasius. <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
The prize was not unworthy of his ambition. At a distance from the
court, and at the head of an immense capital, the patriarch, as he was
now styled, of Alexandria had gradually usurped the state and authority
of a civil magistrate. The public and private charities of the city were
blindly obeyed by his numerous and fanatic parabolani, <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> familiarized
in their daily office with scenes of death; and the praefects of Egypt
were awed or provoked by the temporal power of these Christian pontiffs.
Ardent in the prosecution of heresy, Cyril auspiciously opened his
reign by oppressing the Novatians, the most innocent and harmless of the
sectaries. The interdiction of their religious worship appeared in his
eyes a just and meritorious act; and he confiscated their holy vessels,
without apprehending the guilt of sacrilege. The toleration, and even
the privileges of the Jews, who had multiplied to the number of forty
thousand, were secured by the laws of the Caesars and Ptolemies, and
a long prescription of seven hundred years since the foundation of
Alexandria. Without any legal sentence, without any royal mandate, the
patriarch, at the dawn of day, led a seditious multitude to the attack
of the synagogues. Unarmed and unprepared, the Jews were incapable of
resistance; their houses of prayer were levelled with the ground, and
the episcopal warrior, after-rewarding his troops with the plunder
of their goods, expelled from the city the remnant of the unbelieving
nation. Perhaps he might plead the insolence of their prosperity, and
their deadly hatred of the Christians, whose blood they had recently
shed in a malicious or accidental tumult.
</p>
<p>
Such crimes would have deserved the animadversion of the magistrate;
but in this promiscuous outrage, the innocent were confounded with the
guilty, and Alexandria was impoverished by the loss of a wealthy and
industrious colony. The zeal of Cyril exposed him to the penalties of
the Julian law; but in a feeble government and a superstitious age, he
was secure of impunity, and even of praise. Orestes complained; but
his just complaints were too quickly forgotten by the ministers of
Theodosius, and too deeply remembered by a priest who affected to
pardon, and continued to hate, the praefect of Egypt. As he passed
through the streets, his chariot was assaulted by a band of five hundred
of the Nitrian monks his guards fled from the wild beasts of the desert;
his protestations that he was a Christian and a Catholic were answered
by a volley of stones, and the face of Orestes was covered with blood.
The loyal citizens of Alexandria hastened to his rescue; he instantly
satisfied his justice and revenge against the monk by whose hand he had
been wounded, and Ammonius expired under the rod of the lictor. At the
command of Cyril his body was raised from the ground, and transported,
in solemn procession, to the cathedral; the name of Ammonius was changed
to that of Thaumasius the wonderful; his tomb was decorated with
the trophies of martyrdom, and the patriarch ascended the pulpit to
celebrate the magnanimity of an assassin and a rebel. Such honors might
incite the faithful to combat and die under the banners of the saint;
and he soon prompted, or accepted, the sacrifice of a virgin, who
professed the religion of the Greeks, and cultivated the friendship
of Orestes. Hypatia, the daughter of Theon the mathematician, <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> was
initiated in her father's studies; her learned comments have elucidated
the geometry of Apollonius and Diophantus, and she publicly taught, both
at Athens and Alexandria, the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. In the
bloom of beauty, and in the maturity of wisdom, the modest maid refused
her lovers and instructed her disciples; the persons most illustrious
for their rank or merit were impatient to visit the female philosopher;
and Cyril beheld, with a jealous eye, the gorgeous train of horses and
slaves who crowded the door of her academy. A rumor was spread among
the Christians, that the daughter of Theon was the only obstacle to the
reconciliation of the praefect and the archbishop; and that obstacle was
speedily removed. On a fatal day, in the holy season of Lent, Hypatia
was torn from her chariot, stripped naked, dragged to the church, and
inhumanly butchered by the hands of Peter the reader, and a troop of
savage and merciless fanatics: her flesh was scraped from her bones with
sharp cyster shells, <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> and her quivering limbs were delivered to
the flames. The just progress of inquiry and punishment was stopped by
seasonable gifts; but the murder of Hypatia has imprinted an indelible
stain on the character and religion of Cyril of Alexandria. <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a>

and to restrain their number to five or six hundred. But these
restraints were transient and ineffectual. See the Theodosian Code, l.

Superstition, perhaps, would more gently expiate the blood of a virgin,
than the banishment of a saint; and Cyril had accompanied his uncle
to the iniquitous synod of the Oak. When the memory of Chrysostom was
restored and consecrated, the nephew of Theophilus, at the head of a
dying faction, still maintained the justice of his sentence; nor was it
till after a tedious delay and an obstinate resistance, that he yielded
to the consent of the Catholic world. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> His enmity to the Byzantine
pontiffs <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> was a sense of interest, not a sally of passion: he envied
their fortunate station in the sunshine of the Imperial court; and he
dreaded their upstart ambition. which oppressed the metropolitans of
Europe and Asia, invaded the provinces of Antioch and Alexandria, and
measured their diocese by the limits of the empire. The long moderation
of Atticus, the mild usurper of the throne of Chrysostom, suspended the
animosities of the Eastern patriarchs; but Cyril was at length awakened
by the exaltation of a rival more worthy of his esteem and hatred. After
the short and troubled reign of Sisinnius, bishop of Constantinople,
the factions of the clergy and people were appeased by the choice of the
emperor, who, on this occasion, consulted the voice of fame, and invited
the merit of a stranger.

<p>
Nestorius, <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> native of Germanicia, and a monk of Antioch, was
recommended by the austerity of his life, and the eloquence of his
sermons; but the first homily which he preached before the devout
Theodosius betrayed the acrimony and impatience of his zeal. "Give me, O
Caesar!" he exclaimed, "give me the earth purged of heretics, and I
will give you in exchange the kingdom of heaven. Exterminate with me the
heretics; and with you I will exterminate the Persians." On the
fifth day as if the treaty had been already signed, the patriarch of
Constantinople discovered, surprised, and attacked a secret conventicle
of the Arians: they preferred death to submission; the flames that were
kindled by their despair, soon spread to the neighboring houses, and the
triumph of Nestorius was clouded by the name of incendiary. On either
side of the Hellespont his episcopal vigor imposed a rigid formulary of
faith and discipline; a chronological error concerning the festival of
Easter was punished as an offence against the church and state. Lydia
and Caria, Sardes and Miletus, were purified with the blood of the
obstinate Quartodecimans; and the edict of the emperor, or rather of the
patriarch, enumerates three-and-twenty degrees and denominations in the
guilt and punishment of heresy. <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> But the sword of persecution which
Nestorius so furiously wielded was soon turned against his own breast.
Religion was the pretence; but, in the judgment of a contemporary saint,
ambition was the genuine motive of episcopal warfare. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a>

with the rash and recent title of mother of God, <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> which had been
insensibly adopted since the origin of the Arian controversy. From the
pulpit of Constantinople, a friend of the patriarch, and afterwards the
patriarch himself, repeatedly preached against the use, or the abuse,
of a word <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> unknown to the apostles, unauthorized by the church, and
which could only tend to alarm the timorous, to mislead the simple, to
amuse the profane, and to justify, by a seeming resemblance, the old
genealogy of Olympus. <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> In his calmer moments Nestorius confessed,
that it might be tolerated or excused by the union of the two natures,
and the communication of their idioms: <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> but he was exasperated, by
contradiction, to disclaim the worship of a new-born, an infant Deity,
to draw his inadequate similes from the conjugal or civil partnerships
of life, and to describe the manhood of Christ as the robe, the
instrument, the tabernacle of his Godhead. At these blasphemous sounds,
the pillars of the sanctuary were shaken. The unsuccessful competitors
of Nestorius indulged their pious or personal resentment, the Byzantine
clergy was secretly displeased with the intrusion of a stranger:
whatever is superstitious or absurd, might claim the protection of
the monks; and the people were interested in the glory of their virgin
patroness. <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> The sermons of the archbishop, and the service of the
altar, were disturbed by seditious clamor; his authority and doctrine
were renounced by separate congregations; every wind scattered round the
empire the leaves of controversy; and the voice of the combatants on a
sonorous theatre reechoed in the cells of Palestine and Egypt. It was
the duty of Cyril to enlighten the zeal and ignorance of his innumerable
monks: in the school of Alexandria, he had imbibed and professed the
incarnation of one nature; and the successor of Athanasius consulted
his pride and ambition, when he rose in arms against another Arius, more
formidable and more guilty, on the second throne of the hierarchy. After
a short correspondence, in which the rival prelates disguised their
hatred in the hollow language of respect and charity, the patriarch of
Alexandria denounced to the prince and people, to the East and to the
West, the damnable errors of the Byzantine pontiff. From the East,
more especially from Antioch, he obtained the ambiguous counsels of
toleration and silence, which were addressed to both parties while they
favored the cause of Nestorius. But the Vatican received with open arms
the messengers of Egypt. The vanity of Celestine was flattered by the
appeal; and the partial version of a monk decided the faith of the pope,
who with his Latin clergy was ignorant of the language, the arts, and
the theology of the Greeks. At the head of an Italian synod, Celestine
weighed the merits of the cause, approved the creed of Cyril, condemned
the sentiments and person of Nestorius, degraded the heretic from his
episcopal dignity, allowed a respite of ten days for recantation and
penance, and delegated to his enemy the execution of this rash and
illegal sentence. But the patriarch of Alexandria, while he darted the
thunders of a god, exposed the errors and passions of a mortal; and his
twelve anathemas <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> still torture the orthodox slaves, who adore the
memory of a saint, without forfeiting their allegiance to the synod of
Chalcedon. These bold assertions are indelibly tinged with the colors
of the Apollinarian heresy; but the serious, and perhaps the sincere
professions of Nestorius have satisfied the wiser and less partial
theologians of the present times. <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a>

<p>
Yet neither the emperor nor the primate of the East were disposed to
obey the mandate of an Italian priest; and a synod of the Catholic, or
rather of the Greek church, was unanimously demanded as the sole remedy
that could appease or decide this ecclesiastical quarrel. <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> Ephesus,
on all sides accessible by sea and land, was chosen for the place, the
festival of Pentecost for the day, of the meeting; a writ of summons was
despatched to each metropolitan, and a guard was stationed to protect
and confine the fathers till they should settle the mysteries of heaven,
and the faith of the earth. Nestorius appeared not as a criminal, but
as a judge; he depended on the weight rather than the number of his
prelates, and his sturdy slaves from the baths of Zeuxippus were armed
for every service of injury or defence. But his adversary Cyril was more
powerful in the weapons both of the flesh and of the spirit. Disobedient
to the letter, or at least to the meaning, of the royal summons, he was
attended by fifty Egyptian bishops, who expected from their patriarch's
nod the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. He had contracted an intimate
alliance with Memnon, bishop of Ephesus. The despotic primate of Asia
disposed of the ready succors of thirty or forty episcopal votes: a
crowd of peasants, the slaves of the church, was poured into the city to
support with blows and clamors a metaphysical argument; and the people
zealously asserted the honor of the Virgin, whose body reposed within
the walls of Ephesus. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> The fleet which had transported Cyril from
Alexandria was laden with the riches of Egypt; and he disembarked a
numerous body of mariners, slaves, and fanatics, enlisted with blind
obedience under the banner of St. Mark and the mother of God. The
fathers, and even the guards, of the council were awed by this martial
array; the adversaries of Cyril and Mary were insulted in the streets,
or threatened in their houses; his eloquence and liberality made a daily
increase in the number of his adherents; and the Egyptian soon computed
that he might command the attendance and the voices of two hundred
bishops. <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> But the author of the twelve anathemas foresaw and dreaded
the opposition of John of Antioch, who, with a small, but respectable,
train of metropolitans and divines, was advancing by slow journeys
from the distant capital of the East. Impatient of a delay, which he
stigmatized as voluntary and culpable, <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> Cyril announced the opening
of the synod sixteen days after the festival of Pentecost. Nestorius,
who depended on the near approach of his Eastern friends, persisted,
like his predecessor Chrysostom, to disclaim the jurisdiction, and to
disobey the summons, of his enemies: they hastened his trial, and
his accuser presided in the seat of judgment. Sixty-eight bishops,
twenty-two of metropolitan rank, defended his cause by a modest and
temperate protest: they were excluded from the councils of their
brethren. Candidian, in the emperor's name, requested a delay of four
days; the profane magistrate was driven with outrage and insult from
the assembly of the saints. The whole of this momentous transaction was
crowded into the compass of a summer's day: the bishops delivered their
separate opinions; but the uniformity of style reveals the influence
or the hand of a master, who has been accused of corrupting the public
evidence of their acts and subscriptions. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> Without a dissenting
voice, they recognized in the epistles of Cyril the Nicene creed and the
doctrine of the fathers: but the partial extracts from the letters and
homilies of Nestorius were interrupted by curses and anathemas: and the
heretic was degraded from his episcopal and ecclesiastical dignity.
The sentence, maliciously inscribed to the new Judas, was affixed and
proclaimed in the streets of Ephesus: the weary prelates, as they issued
from the church of the mother of God, were saluted as her champions;
and her victory was celebrated by the illuminations, the songs, and the
tumult of the night.

On the fifth day, the triumph was clouded by the arrival and indignation
of the Eastern bishops. In a chamber of the inn, before he had wiped
the dust from his shoes, John of Antioch gave audience to Candidian, the
Imperial minister; who related his ineffectual efforts to prevent or to
annul the hasty violence of the Egyptian. With equal haste and violence,
the Oriental synod of fifty bishops degraded Cyril and Memnon from their
episcopal honors, condemned, in the twelve anathemas, the purest venom
of the Apollinarian heresy, and described the Alexandrian primate as a
monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church. <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> His
throne was distant and inaccessible; but they instantly resolved to
bestow on the flock of Ephesus the blessing of a faithful shepherd.
By the vigilance of Memnon, the churches were shut against them, and
a strong garrison was thrown into the cathedral. The troops, under the
command of Candidian, advanced to the assault; the outguards were routed
and put to the sword, but the place was impregnable: the besiegers
retired; their retreat was pursued by a vigorous sally; they lost their
horses, and many of their soldiers were dangerously wounded with clubs
and stones. Ephesus, the city of the Virgin, was defiled with rage and
clamor, with sedition and blood; the rival synods darted anathemas
and excommunications from their spiritual engines; and the court of
Theodosius was perplexed by the adverse and contradictory narratives of
the Syrian and Egyptian factions. During a busy period of three months,
the emperor tried every method, except the most effectual means of
indifference and contempt, to reconcile this theological quarrel. He
attempted to remove or intimidate the leaders by a common sentence, of
acquittal or condemnation; he invested his representatives at Ephesus
with ample power and military force; he summoned from either party eight
chosen deputies to a free and candid conference in the neighborhood of
the capital, far from the contagion of popular frenzy. But the Orientals
refused to yield, and the Catholics, proud of their numbers and of their
Latin allies, rejected all terms of union or toleration. The patience
of the meek Theodosius was provoked; and he dissolved in anger this
episcopal tumult, which at the distance of thirteen centuries assumes
the venerable aspect of the third oecumenical council. <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> "God is
my witness," said the pious prince, "that I am not the author of this
confusion. His providence will discern and punish the guilty. Return
to your provinces, and may your private virtues repair the mischief and
scandal of your meeting." They returned to their provinces; but the same
passions which had distracted the synod of Ephesus were diffused over
the Eastern world. After three obstinate and equal campaigns, John of
Antioch and Cyril of Alexandria condescended to explain and embrace: but
their seeming reunion must be imputed rather to prudence than to reason,
to the mutual lassitude rather than to the Christian charity of the
patriarchs.

The Byzantine pontiff had instilled into the royal ear a baleful
prejudice against the character and conduct of his Egyptian rival. An
epistle of menace and invective, <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> which accompanied the summons,
accused him as a busy, insolent, and envious priest, who perplexed the
simplicity of the faith, violated the peace of the church and state,
and, by his artful and separate addresses to the wife and sister of
Theodosius, presumed to suppose, or to scatter, the seeds of discord in
the Imperial family. At the stern command of his sovereign. Cyril had
repaired to Ephesus, where he was resisted, threatened, and confined,
by the magistrates in the interest of Nestorius and the Orientals; who
assembled the troops of Lydia and Ionia to suppress the fanatic and
disorderly train of the patriarch. Without expecting the royal license,
he escaped from his guards, precipitately embarked, deserted the
imperfect synod, and retired to his episcopal fortress of safety and
independence. But his artful emissaries, both in the court and city,
successfully labored to appease the resentment, and to conciliate the
favor, of the emperor. The feeble son of Arcadius was alternately
swayed by his wife and sister, by the eunuchs and women of the palace:
superstition and avarice were their ruling passions; and the orthodox
chiefs were assiduous in their endeavors to alarm the former, and to
gratify the latter. Constantinople and the suburbs were sanctified with
frequent monasteries, and the holy abbots, Dalmatius and Eutyches, <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a>
had devoted their zeal and fidelity to the cause of Cyril, the worship
of Mary, and the unity of Christ. From the first moment of their
monastic life, they had never mingled with the world, or trod the
profane ground of the city. But in this awful moment of the danger of
the church, their vow was superseded by a more sublime and indispensable
duty. At the head of a long order of monks and hermits, who carried
burning tapers in their hands, and chanted litanies to the mother of
God, they proceeded from their monasteries to the palace. The people was
edified and inflamed by this extraordinary spectacle, and the trembling
monarch listened to the prayers and adjurations of the saints, who
boldly pronounced, that none could hope for salvation, unless they
embraced the person and the creed of the orthodox successor of
Athanasius. At the same time, every avenue of the throne was assaulted
with gold. Under the decent names of eulogies and benedictions, the
courtiers of both sexes were bribed according to the measure of their
power and rapaciousness. But their incessant demands despoiled the
sanctuaries of Constantinople and Alexandria; and the authority of the
patriarch was unable to silence the just murmur of his clergy, that a
debt of sixty thousand pounds had already been contracted to support the
expense of this scandalous corruption. <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> Pulcheria, who relieved
her brother from the weight of an empire, was the firmest pillar of
orthodoxy; and so intimate was the alliance between the thunders of the
synod and the whispers of the court, that Cyril was assured of success
if he could displace one eunuch, and substitute another in the favor of
Theodosius. Yet the Egyptian could not boast of a glorious or decisive
victory. The emperor, with unaccustomed firmness, adhered to his promise
of protecting the innocence of the Oriental bishops; and Cyril softened
his anathemas, and confessed, with ambiguity and reluctance, a twofold
nature of Christ, before he was permitted to satiate his revenge against
the unfortunate Nestorius. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a>

The rash and obstinate Nestorius, before the end of the synod, was
oppressed by Cyril, betrayed by the court, and faintly supported by his
Eastern friends. A sentiment or fear or indignation prompted him, while
it was yet time, to affect the glory of a voluntary abdication: <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a>
his wish, or at least his request, was readily granted; he was conducted
with honor from Ephesus to his old monastery of Antioch; and, after a
short pause, his successors, Maximian and Proclus, were acknowledged as
the lawful bishops of Constantinople. But in the silence of his cell,
the degraded patriarch could no longer resume the innocence and security
of a private monk. The past he regretted, he was discontented with the
present, and the future he had reason to dread: the Oriental bishops
successively disengaged their cause from his unpopular name, and each
day decreased the number of the schismatics who revered Nestorius as the
confessor of the faith. After a residence at Antioch of four years, the
hand of Theodosius subscribed an edict, <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> which ranked him with
Simon the magician, proscribed his opinions and followers, condemned
his writings to the flames, and banished his person first to Petra, in
Arabia, and at length to Oasis, one of the islands of the Libyan desert.
<a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> Secluded from the church and from the world, the exile was still
pursued by the rage of bigotry and war. A wandering tribe of the
Blemmyes or Nubians invaded his solitary prison: in their retreat they
dismissed a crowd of useless captives: but no sooner had Nestorius
reached the banks of the Nile, than he would gladly have escaped from
a Roman and orthodox city, to the milder servitude of the savages. His
flight was punished as a new crime: the soul of the patriarch inspired
the civil and ecclesiastical powers of Egypt; the magistrates, the
soldiers, the monks, devoutly tortured the enemy of Christ and St.
Cyril; and, as far as the confines of Aethiopia, the heretic was
alternately dragged and recalled, till his aged body was broken by the
hardships and accidents of these reiterated journeys. Yet his mind was
still independent and erect; the president of Thebais was awed by his
pastoral letters; he survived the Catholic tyrant of Alexandria, and,
after sixteen years' banishment, the synod of Chalcedon would perhaps
have restored him to the honors, or at least to the communion, of the
church. The death of Nestorius prevented his obedience to their welcome
summons; <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> and his disease might afford some color to the scandalous
report, that his tongue, the organ of blasphemy, had been eaten by the
worms. He was buried in a city of Upper Egypt, known by the names of
Chemnis, or Panopolis, or Akmim; <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> but the immortal malice of the
Jacobites has persevered for ages to cast stones against his sepulchre,

rain of heaven, which equally descends on the righteous and the ungodly.
<a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> Humanity may drop a tear on the fate of Nestorius; yet justice

<h2>
    Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
The death of the Alexandrian primate, after a reign of thirty-two years,
abandoned the Catholics to the intemperance of zeal and the abuse
of victory. <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> The monophysite doctrine (one incarnate nature) was
rigorously preached in the churches of Egypt and the monasteries of the
East; the primitive creed of Apollinarius was protected by the sanctity
of Cyril; and the name of Eutyches, his venerable friend, has been
applied to the sect most adverse to the Syrian heresy of Nestorius. His
rival Eutyches was the abbot, or archimandrite, or superior of three
hundred monks, but the opinions of a simple and illiterate recluse might
have expired in the cell, where he had slept above seventy years, if the
resentment or indiscretion of Flavian, the Byzantine pontiff, had not
exposed the scandal to the eyes of the Christian world. His domestic
synod was instantly convened, their proceedings were sullied with
clamor and artifice, and the aged heretic was surprised into a seeming
confession, that Christ had not derived his body from the substance
of the Virgin Mary. From their partial decree, Eutyches appealed to a
general council; and his cause was vigorously asserted by his godson
Chrysaphius, the reigning eunuch of the palace, and his accomplice
Dioscorus, who had succeeded to the throne, the creed, the talents,
and the vices, of the nephew of Theophilus. By the special summons of
Theodosius, the second synod of Ephesus was judiciously composed of
ten metropolitans and ten bishops from each of the six dioceses of the
Eastern empire: some exceptions of favor or merit enlarged the number to
one hundred and thirty-five; and the Syrian Barsumas, as the chief
and representative of the monks, was invited to sit and vote with
the successors of the apostles. But the despotism of the Alexandrian
patriarch again oppressed the freedom of debate: the same spiritual and
carnal weapons were again drawn from the arsenals of Egypt: the Asiatic
veterans, a band of archers, served under the orders of Dioscorus; and
the more formidable monks, whose minds were inaccessible to reason or
mercy, besieged the doors of the cathedral. The general, and, as it
should seem, the unconstrained voice of the fathers, accepted the faith
and even the anathemas of Cyril; and the heresy of the two natures
was formally condemned in the persons and writings of the most learned
Orientals. "May those who divide Christ be divided with the sword, may
they be hewn in pieces, may they be burned alive!" were the charitable
wishes of a Christian synod. <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> The innocence and sanctity of Eutyches
were acknowledged without hesitation; but the prelates, more especially
those of Thrace and Asia, were unwilling to depose their patriarch for
the use or even the abuse of his lawful jurisdiction. They embraced
the knees of Dioscorus, as he stood with a threatening aspect on the
footstool of his throne, and conjured him to forgive the offences,
and to respect the dignity, of his brother. "Do you mean to raise a
sedition?" exclaimed the relentless tyrant. "Where are the officers?" At
these words a furious multitude of monks and soldiers, with staves, and
swords, and chains, burst into the church; the trembling bishops hid
themselves behind the altar, or under the benches, and as they were
not inspired with the zeal of martyrdom, they successively subscribed
a blank paper, which was afterwards filled with the condemnation of the
Byzantine pontiff. Flavian was instantly delivered to the wild beasts of
this spiritual amphitheatre: the monks were stimulated by the voice and
example of Barsumas to avenge the injuries of Christ: it is said that
the patriarch of Alexandria reviled, and buffeted, and kicked, and
trampled his brother of Constantinople: <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> it is certain, that the
victim, before he could reach the place of his exile, expired on the
third day of the wounds and bruises which he had received at Ephesus.
This second synod has been justly branded as a gang of robbers and
assassins; yet the accusers of Dioscorus would magnify his violence, to
alleviate the cowardice and inconstancy of their own behavior.

</p>
<p>
The faith of Egypt had prevailed: but the vanquished party was supported
by the same pope who encountered without fear the hostile rage of Attila
and Genseric. The theology of Leo, his famous tome or epistle on
the mystery of the incarnation, had been disregarded by the synod of
Ephesus: his authority, and that of the Latin church, was insulted in
his legates, who escaped from slavery and death to relate the melancholy
tale of the tyranny of Dioscorus and the martyrdom of Flavian. His
provincial synod annulled the irregular proceedings of Ephesus; but
as this step was itself irregular, he solicited the convocation of a
general council in the free and orthodox provinces of Italy. From his
independent throne, the Roman bishop spoke and acted without danger
as the head of the Christians, and his dictates were obsequiously
transcribed by Placidia and her son Valentinian; who addressed their
Eastern colleague to restore the peace and unity of the church. But the
pageant of Oriental royalty was moved with equal dexterity by the hand
of the eunuch; and Theodosius could pronounce, without hesitation, that
the church was already peaceful and triumphant, and that the recent
flame had been extinguished by the just punishment of the Nestorians.
Perhaps the Greeks would be still involved in the heresy of the
Monophysites, if the emperor's horse had not fortunately stumbled;
Theodosius expired; his orthodox sister Pulcheria, with a nominal
husband, succeeded to the throne; Chrysaphius was burnt, Dioscorus was
disgraced, the exiles were recalled, and the tome of Leo was subscribed
by the Oriental bishops. Yet the pope was disappointed in his favorite
project of a Latin council: he disdained to preside in the Greek synod,
which was speedily assembled at Nice in Bithynia; his legates required
in a peremptory tone the presence of the emperor; and the weary fathers
were transported to Chalcedon under the immediate eye of Marcian and
the senate of Constantinople. A quarter of a mile from the Thracian
Bosphorus, the church of St. Euphemia was built on the summit of a
gentle though lofty ascent: the triple structure was celebrated as a
prodigy of art, and the boundless prospect of the land and sea might
have raised the mind of a sectary to the contemplation of the God of
the universe. Six hundred and thirty bishops were ranged in order in the
nave of the church; but the patriarchs of the East were preceded by the
legates, of whom the third was a simple priest; and the place of honor
was reserved for twenty laymen of consular or senatorian rank. The
gospel was ostentatiously displayed in the centre, but the rule of
faith was defined by the Papal and Imperial ministers, who moderated
the thirteen sessions of the council of Chalcedon. <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> Their partial
interposition silenced the intemperate shouts and execrations, which
degraded the episcopal gravity; but, on the formal accusation of the
legates, Dioscorus was compelled to descend from his throne to the
rank of a criminal, already condemned in the opinion of his judges. The
Orientals, less adverse to Nestorius than to Cyril, accepted the Romans
as their deliverers: Thrace, and Pontus, and Asia, were exasperated
against the murderer of Flavian, and the new patriarchs of
Constantinople and Antioch secured their places by the sacrifice of
their benefactor. The bishops of Palestine, Macedonia, and Greece, were
attached to the faith of Cyril; but in the face of the synod, in the
heat of the battle, the leaders, with their obsequious train, passed
from the right to the left wing, and decided the victory by this
seasonable desertion. Of the seventeen suffragans who sailed from
Alexandria, four were tempted from their allegiance, and the thirteen,
falling prostrate on the ground, implored the mercy of the council, with
sighs and tears, and a pathetic declaration, that, if they yielded, they
should be massacred, on their return to Egypt, by the indignant people.
A tardy repentance was allowed to expiate the guilt or error of the
accomplices of Dioscorus: but their sins were accumulated on his head;
he neither asked nor hoped for pardon, and the moderation of those
who pleaded for a general amnesty was drowned in the prevailing cry of
victory and revenge.
</p>
<p>
To save the reputation of his late adherents, some personal offences
were skilfully detected; his rash and illegal excommunication of the
pope, and his contumacious refusal (while he was detained a prisoner) to
attend to the summons of the synod. Witnesses were introduced to prove
the special facts of his pride, avarice, and cruelty; and the fathers
heard with abhorrence, that the alms of the church were lavished on
the female dancers, that his palace, and even his bath, was open to the
prostitutes of Alexandria, and that the infamous Pansophia, or Irene,
was publicly entertained as the concubine of the patriarch. <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a>

the genuine or corrupted name of the bishop's concubine: I am ignorant

Cimon of a preceding epigram, was viewed with envy and wonder by Priapus
himself.]
</p>
<p>
For these scandalous offences, Dioscorus was deposed by the synod, and
banished by the emperor; but the purity of his faith was declared in the
presence, and with the tacit approbation, of the fathers. Their prudence
supposed rather than pronounced the heresy of Eutyches, who was never
summoned before their tribunal; and they sat silent and abashed, when
a bold Monophysite casting at their feet a volume of Cyril, challenged
them to anathematize in his person the doctrine of the saint. If we
fairly peruse the acts of Chalcedon as they are recorded by the orthodox
party, <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> we shall find that a great majority of the bishops embraced
the simple unity of Christ; and the ambiguous concession that he
was formed Of or From two natures, might imply either their previous
existence, or their subsequent confusion, or some dangerous interval
between the conception of the man and the assumption of the God.
The Roman theology, more positive and precise, adopted the term most
offensive to the ears of the Egyptians, that Christ existed In two
natures; and this momentous particle <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> (which the memory, rather than
the understanding, must retain) had almost produced a schism among
the Catholic bishops. The tome of Leo had been respectfully, perhaps
sincerely, subscribed; but they protested, in two successive debates,
that it was neither expedient nor lawful to transgress the sacred
landmarks which had been fixed at Nice, Constantinople, and Ephesus,
according to the rule of Scripture and tradition. At length they yielded
to the importunities of their masters; but their infallible decree,
after it had been ratified with deliberate votes and vehement
acclamations, was overturned in the next session by the opposition of
the legates and their Oriental friends. It was in vain that a multitude
of episcopal voices repeated in chorus, "The definition of the fathers
is orthodox and immutable! The heretics are now discovered! Anathema
to the Nestorians! Let them depart from the synod! Let them repair to
Rome." <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> The legates threatened, the emperor was absolute, and a
committee of eighteen bishops prepared a new decree, which was imposed
on the reluctant assembly. In the name of the fourth general council,
the Christ in one person, but in two natures, was announced to the
Catholic world: an invisible line was drawn between the heresy of
Apollinaris and the faith of St. Cyril; and the road to paradise,
a bridge as sharp as a razor, was suspended over the abyss by the
master-hand of the theological artist. During ten centuries of blindness
and servitude, Europe received her religious opinions from the oracle of
the Vatican; and the same doctrine, already varnished with the rust of
antiquity, was admitted without dispute into the creed of the reformers,
who disclaimed the supremacy of the Roman pontiff. The synod of
Chalcedon still triumphs in the Protestant churches; but the ferment of
controversy has subsided, and the most pious Christians of the present
day are ignorant, or careless, of their own belief concerning the
mystery of the incarnation.

Far different was the temper of the Greeks and Egyptians under the
orthodox reigns of Leo and Marcian. Those pious emperors enforced with
arms and edicts the symbol of their faith; <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> and it was declared by
the conscience or honor of five hundred bishops, that the decrees of
the synod of Chalcedon might be lawfully supported, even with blood.
The Catholics observed with satisfaction, that the same synod was odious
both to the Nestorians and the Monophysites; <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> but the Nestorians
were less angry, or less powerful, and the East was distracted by
the obstinate and sanguinary zeal of the Monophysites. Jerusalem was
occupied by an army of monks; in the name of the one incarnate nature,
they pillaged, they burnt, they murdered; the sepulchre of Christ was
defiled with blood; and the gates of the city were guarded in tumultuous
rebellion against the troops of the emperor. After the disgrace and
exile of Dioscorus, the Egyptians still regretted their spiritual
father; and detested the usurpation of his successor, who was introduced
by the fathers of Chalcedon. The throne of Proterius was supported by a
guard of two thousand soldiers: he waged a five years' war against the
people of Alexandria; and on the first intelligence of the death of
Marcian, he became the victim of their zeal. On the third day before
the festival of Easter, the patriarch was besieged in the cathedral,
and murdered in the baptistery. The remains of his mangled corpse were
delivered to the flames, and his ashes to the wind; and the deed was
inspired by the vision of a pretended angel: an ambitious monk, who,
under the name of Timothy the Cat, <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> succeeded to the place and
opinions of Dioscorus. This deadly superstition was inflamed, on either
side, by the principle and the practice of retaliation: in the pursuit
of a metaphysical quarrel, many thousands <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> were slain, and the
Christians of every degree were deprived of the substantial enjoyments
of social life, and of the invisible gifts of baptism and the holy
communion. Perhaps an extravagant fable of the times may conceal an
allegorical picture of these fanatics, who tortured each other and
themselves. "Under the consulship of Venantius and Celer," says a grave
bishop, "the people of Alexandria, and all Egypt, were seized with a
strange and diabolical frenzy: great and small, slaves and freedmen,
monks and clergy, the natives of the land, who opposed the synod of
Chalcedon, lost their speech and reason, barked like dogs, and tore,
with their own teeth the flesh from their hands and arms." <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a>

The disorders of thirty years at length produced the famous Henoticon
<a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> of the emperor Zeno, which in his reign, and in that of Anastasius,
was signed by all the bishops of the East, under the penalty of
degradation and exile, if they rejected or infringed this salutary and
fundamental law. The clergy may smile or groan at the presumption of
a layman who defines the articles of faith; yet if he stoops to the
humiliating task, his mind is less infected by prejudice or interest,
and the authority of the magistrate can only be maintained by the
concord of the people. It is in ecclesiastical story, that Zeno appears
least contemptible; and I am not able to discern any Manichaean or
Eutychian guilt in the generous saying of Anastasius. That it was
unworthy of an emperor to persecute the worshippers of Christ and the
citizens of Rome. The Henoticon was most pleasing to the Egyptians; yet
the smallest blemish has not been described by the jealous, and even
jaundiced eyes of our orthodox schoolmen, and it accurately represents
the Catholic faith of the incarnation, without adopting or disclaiming
the peculiar terms of tenets of the hostile sects. A solemn anathema is
pronounced against Nestorius and Eutyches; against all heretics by
whom Christ is divided, or confounded, or reduced to a phantom. Without
defining the number or the article of the word nature, the pure system
of St. Cyril, the faith of Nice, Constantinople, and Ephesus, is
respectfully confirmed; but, instead of bowing at the name of the
fourth council, the subject is dismissed by the censure of all
contrary doctrines, if any such have been taught either elsewhere or at
Chalcedon. Under this ambiguous expression, the friends and the enemies
of the last synod might unite in a silent embrace. The most reasonable
Christians acquiesced in this mode of toleration; but their reason was
feeble and inconstant, and their obedience was despised as timid and
servile by the vehement spirit of their brethren. On a subject which
engrossed the thoughts and discourses of men, it was difficult to
preserve an exact neutrality; a book, a sermon, a prayer, rekindled the
flame of controversy; and the bonds of communion were alternately broken
and renewed by the private animosity of the bishops. The space between
Nestorius and Eutyches was filled by a thousand shades of language and
opinion; the acephali <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> of Egypt, and the Roman pontiffs, of equal
valor, though of unequal strength, may be found at the two extremities
of the theological scale. The acephali, without a king or a bishop, were
separated above three hundred years from the patriarchs of Alexandria,
who had accepted the communion of Constantinople, without exacting
a formal condemnation of the synod of Chalcedon. For accepting the
communion of Alexandria, without a formal approbation of the same synod,
the patriarchs of Constantinople were anathematized by the popes. Their
inflexible despotism involved the most orthodox of the Greek churches
in this spiritual contagion, denied or doubted the validity of their
sacraments, <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> and fomented, thirty-five years, the schism of the
East and West, till they finally abolished the memory of four Byzantine
pontiffs, who had dared to oppose the supremacy of St. Peter. <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a>
Before that period, the precarious truce of Constantinople and Egypt
had been violated by the zeal of the rival prelates. Macedonius, who was
suspected of the Nestorian heresy, asserted, in disgrace and exile, the
synod of Chalcedon, while the successor of Cyril would have purchased
its overthrow with a bribe of two thousand pounds of gold.

<p>
In the fever of the times, the sense, or rather the sound of a syllable,
was sufficient to disturb the peace of an empire. The Trisagion <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a>
(thrice holy,) "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!" is supposed,
by the Greeks, to be the identical hymn which the angels and cherubim
eternally repeat before the throne of God, and which, about the middle
of the fifth century, was miraculously revealed to the church of
Constantinople. The devotion of Antioch soon added, "who was crucified
for us!" and this grateful address, either to Christ alone, or to the
whole Trinity, may be justified by the rules of theology, and has been
gradually adopted by the Catholics of the East and West. But it had been
imagined by a Monophysite bishop; <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> the gift of an enemy was at first
rejected as a dire and dangerous blasphemy, and the rash innovation had
nearly cost the emperor Anastasius his throne and his life. <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> The
people of Constantinople was devoid of any rational principles of
freedom; but they held, as a lawful cause of rebellion, the color of
a livery in the races, or the color of a mystery in the schools. The
Trisagion, with and without this obnoxious addition, was chanted in the
cathedral by two adverse choirs, and when their lungs were exhausted,
they had recourse to the more solid arguments of sticks and stones; the
aggressors were punished by the emperor, and defended by the patriarch;
and the crown and mitre were staked on the event of this momentous
quarrel. The streets were instantly crowded with innumerable swarms
of men, women, and children; the legions of monks, in regular array,
marched, and shouted, and fought at their head, "Christians! this is the
day of martyrdom: let us not desert our spiritual father; anathema to
the Manichaean tyrant! he is unworthy to reign." Such was the Catholic
cry; and the galleys of Anastasius lay upon their oars before the
palace, till the patriarch had pardoned his penitent, and hushed the
waves of the troubled multitude. The triumph of Macedonius was checked
by a speedy exile; but the zeal of his flock was again exasperated by
the same question, "Whether one of the Trinity had been crucified?" On
this momentous occasion, the blue and green factions of Constantinople
suspended their discord, and the civil and military powers were
annihilated in their presence. The keys of the city, and the standards
of the guards, were deposited in the forum of Constantine, the principal
station and camp of the faithful. Day and night they were incessantly
busied either in singing hymns to the honor of their God, or in
pillaging and murdering the servants of their prince. The head of his
favorite monk, the friend, as they styled him, of the enemy of the Holy
Trinity, was borne aloft on a spear; and the firebrands, which had
been darted against heretical structures, diffused the undistinguishing
flames over the most orthodox buildings. The statues of the emperor were
broken, and his person was concealed in a suburb, till, at the end of
three days, he dared to implore the mercy of his subjects. Without his
diadem, and in the posture of a suppliant, Anastasius appeared on the
throne of the circus. The Catholics, before his face, rehearsed their
genuine Trisagion; they exulted in the offer, which he proclaimed by
the voice of a herald, of abdicating the purple; they listened to the
admonition, that, since all could not reign, they should previously
agree in the choice of a sovereign; and they accepted the blood of two
unpopular ministers, whom their master, without hesitation, condemned to
the lions. These furious but transient seditions were encouraged by the
success of Vitalian, who, with an army of Huns and Bulgarians, for
the most part idolaters, declared himself the champion of the Catholic
faith. In this pious rebellion he depopulated Thrace, besieged
Constantinople, exterminated sixty-five thousand of his
fellow-Christians, till he obtained the recall of the bishops, the
satisfaction of the pope, and the establishment of the council
of Chalcedon, an orthodox treaty, reluctantly signed by the dying
Anastasius, and more faithfully performed by the uncle of Justinian. And
such was the event of the first of the religious wars which have been
waged in the name and by the disciples, of the God of peace. <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
Justinian has been already seen in the various lights of a prince, a
conqueror, and a lawgiver: the theologian <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> still remains, and it
affords an unfavorable prejudice, that his theology should form a very
prominent feature of his portrait. The sovereign sympathized with
his subjects in their superstitious reverence for living and departed
saints: his Code, and more especially his Novels, confirm and enlarge
the privileges of the clergy; and in every dispute between a monk and
a layman, the partial judge was inclined to pronounce, that truth, and
innocence, and justice, were always on the side of the church. In his
public and private devotions, the emperor was assiduous and exemplary;
his prayers, vigils, and fasts, displayed the austere penance of a monk;
his fancy was amused by the hope, or belief, of personal inspiration; he
had secured the patronage of the Virgin and St. Michael the archangel;
and his recovery from a dangerous disease was ascribed to the miraculous
succor of the holy martyrs Cosmas and Damian. The capital and the
provinces of the East were decorated with the monuments of his religion;
<a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> and though the far greater part of these costly structures may be
attributed to his taste or ostentation, the zeal of the royal architect
was probably quickened by a genuine sense of love and gratitude towards
his invisible benefactors. Among the titles of Imperial greatness, the
name of Pious was most pleasing to his ear; to promote the temporal and
spiritual interest of the church was the serious business of his life;
and the duty of father of his country was often sacrificed to that of
defender of the faith. The controversies of the times were congenial
to his temper and understanding and the theological professors must
inwardly deride the diligence of a stranger, who cultivated their art
and neglected his own. "What can ye fear," said a bold conspirator to
his associates, "from your bigoted tyrant? Sleepless and unarmed, he
sits whole nights in his closet, debating with reverend graybeards, and
turning over the pages of ecclesiastical volumes." <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a> The fruits of
these lucubrations were displayed in many a conference, where Justinian
might shine as the loudest and most subtile of the disputants; in many a
sermon, which, under the name of edicts and epistles, proclaimed to the
empire the theology of their master. While the Barbarians invaded the
provinces, while the victorious legion marched under the banners of
Belisarius and Narses, the successor of Trajan, unknown to the camp,
was content to vanquish at the head of a synod. Had he invited to these
synods a disinterested and rational spectator, Justinian might have
learned, "that religious controversy is the offspring of arrogance
and folly; that true piety is most laudably expressed by silence and
submission; that man, ignorant of his own nature, should not presume to
scrutinize the nature of his God; and that it is sufficient for us
to know, that power and benevolence are the perfect attributes of the
Deity." <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a>

</p>
<p>
Toleration was not the virtue of the times, and indulgence to rebels has
seldom been the virtue of princes. But when the prince descends to the
narrow and peevish character of a disputant, he is easily provoked to
supply the defect of argument by the plenitude of power, and to chastise
without mercy the perverse blindness of those who wilfully shut their
eyes against the light of demonstration. The reign of Justinian was
a uniform yet various scene of persecution; and he appears to have
surpassed his indolent predecessors, both in the contrivance of his laws
and the rigor of their execution. The insufficient term of three months
was assigned for the conversion or exile of all heretics; <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> and if he
still connived at their precarious stay, they were deprived, under
his iron yoke, not only of the benefits of society, but of the common
birth-right of men and Christians. At the end of four hundred years,
the Montanists of Phrygia <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> still breathed the wild enthusiasm of
perfection and prophecy which they had imbibed from their male and
female apostles, the special organs of the Paraclete. On the approach of
the Catholic priests and soldiers, they grasped with alacrity the
crown of martyrdom the conventicle and the congregation perished in the
flames, but these primitive fanatics were not extinguished three hundred
years after the death of their tyrant. Under the protection of their
Gothic confederates, the church of the Arians at Constantinople had
braved the severity of the laws: their clergy equalled the wealth and
magnificence of the senate; and the gold and silver which were seized by
the rapacious hand of Justinian might perhaps be claimed as the spoils
of the provinces, and the trophies of the Barbarians. A secret remnant
of Pagans, who still lurked in the most refined and most rustic
conditions of mankind, excited the indignation of the Christians, who
were perhaps unwilling that any strangers should be the witnesses of
their intestine quarrels. A bishop was named as the inquisitor of the
faith, and his diligence soon discovered, in the court and city, the
magistrates, lawyers, physicians, and sophists, who still cherished the
superstition of the Greeks. They were sternly informed that they must
choose without delay between the displeasure of Jupiter or Justinian,
and that their aversion to the gospel could no longer be distinguished
under the scandalous mask of indifference or impiety. The patrician
Photius, perhaps, alone was resolved to live and to die like his
ancestors: he enfranchised himself with the stroke of a dagger, and left
his tyrant the poor consolation of exposing with ignominy the lifeless
corpse of the fugitive. His weaker brethren submitted to their earthly
monarch, underwent the ceremony of baptism, and labored, by their
extraordinary zeal, to erase the suspicion, or to expiate the guilt,
of idolatry. The native country of Homer, and the theatre of the Trojan
war, still retained the last sparks of his mythology: by the care of
the same bishop, seventy thousand Pagans were detected and converted in
Asia, Phrygia, Lydia, and Caria; ninety-six churches were built for the
new proselytes; and linen vestments, Bibles, and liturgies, and vases
of gold and silver, were supplied by the pious munificence of Justinian.
<a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> The Jews, who had been gradually stripped of their immunities,
were oppressed by a vexatious law, which compelled them to observe
the festival of Easter the same day on which it was celebrated by the
Christians. <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a> And they might complain with the more reason, since the
Catholics themselves did not agree with the astronomical calculations of
their sovereign: the people of Constantinople delayed the beginning of
their Lent a whole week after it had been ordained by authority; and
they had the pleasure of fasting seven days, while meat was exposed for
sale by the command of the emperor. The Samaritans of Palestine <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a>
were a motley race, an ambiguous sect, rejected as Jews by the Pagans,
by the Jews as schismatics, and by the Christians as idolaters. The
abomination of the cross had already been planted on their holy mount
of Garizim, <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> but the persecution of Justinian offered only the
alternative of baptism or rebellion. They chose the latter: under the
standard of a desperate leader, they rose in arms, and retaliated their
wrongs on the lives, the property, and the temples, of a defenceless
people. The Samaritans were finally subdued by the regular forces of the
East: twenty thousand were slain, twenty thousand were sold by the Arabs
to the infidels of Persia and India, and the remains of that unhappy
nation atoned for the crime of treason by the sin of hypocrisy. It has
been computed that one hundred thousand Roman subjects were extirpated
in the Samaritan war, <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a> which converted the once fruitful province
into a desolate and smoking wilderness. But in the creed of Justinian,
the guilt of murder could not be applied to the slaughter of
unbelievers; and he piously labored to establish with fire and sword the
unity of the Christian faith. <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a>

With these sentiments, it was incumbent on him, at least, to be always
in the right. In the first years of his administration, he signalized
his zeal as the disciple and patron of orthodoxy: the reconciliation of
the Greeks and Latins established the tome of St. Leo as the creed of
the emperor and the empire; the Nestorians and Eutychians were exposed.
on either side, to the double edge of persecution; and the four synods
of Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, were ratified by the
code of a Catholic lawgiver. <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> But while Justinian strove to maintain
the uniformity of faith and worship, his wife Theodora, whose vices
were not incompatible with devotion, had listened to the Monophysite
teachers; and the open or clandestine enemies of the church revived and
multiplied at the smile of their gracious patroness. The capital, the
palace, the nuptial bed, were torn by spiritual discord; yet so doubtful
was the sincerity of the royal consorts, that their seeming disagreement
was imputed by many to a secret and mischievous confederacy against the
religion and happiness of their people. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> The famous dispute of the
Three Chapters, <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> which has filled more volumes than it deserves
lines, is deeply marked with this subtile and disingenuous spirit. It
was now three hundred years since the body of Origen <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> had been eaten
by the worms: his soul, of which he held the preexistence, was in the
hands of its Creator; but his writings were eagerly perused by the monks
of Palestine. In these writings, the piercing eye of Justinian descried
more than ten metaphysical errors; and the primitive doctor, in the
company of Pythagoras and Plato, was devoted by the clergy to the
eternity of hell-fire, which he had presumed to deny. Under the cover
of this precedent, a treacherous blow was aimed at the council of
Chalcedon. The fathers had listened without impatience to the praise
of Theodore of Mopsuestia; <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> and their justice or indulgence had
restored both Theodore of Cyrrhus, and Ibas of Edessa, to the communion
of the church. But the characters of these Oriental bishops were tainted
with the reproach of heresy; the first had been the master, the two
others were the friends, of Nestorius; their most suspicious passages
were accused under the title of the three chapters; and the condemnation
of their memory must involve the honor of a synod, whose name was
pronounced with sincere or affected reverence by the Catholic world. If
these bishops, whether innocent or guilty, were annihilated in the sleep
of death, they would not probably be awakened by the clamor which, after
the a hundred years, was raised over their grave. If they were already
in the fangs of the daemon, their torments could neither be aggravated
nor assuaged by human industry. If in the company of saints and angels
they enjoyed the rewards of piety, they must have smiled at the idle
fury of the theological insects who still crawled on the surface of the
earth. The foremost of these insects, the emperor of the Romans, darted
his sting, and distilled his venom, perhaps without discerning the true
motives of Theodora and her ecclesiastical faction. The victims were no
longer subject to his power, and the vehement style of his edicts could
only proclaim their damnation, and invite the clergy of the East to
join in a full chorus of curses and anathemas. The East, with some
hesitation, consented to the voice of her sovereign: the fifth general
council, of three patriarchs and one hundred and sixty-five bishops, was
held at Constantinople; and the authors, as well as the defenders, of
the three chapters were separated from the communion of the saints, and
solemnly delivered to the prince of darkness. But the Latin churches
were more jealous of the honor of Leo and the synod of Chalcedon: and
if they had fought as they usually did under the standard of Rome, they
might have prevailed in the cause of reason and humanity. But their
chief was a prisoner in the hands of the enemy; the throne of St. Peter,
which had been disgraced by the simony, was betrayed by the cowardice,
of Vigilius, who yielded, after a long and inconsistent struggle, to
the despotism of Justinian and the sophistry of the Greeks. His apostasy
provoked the indignation of the Latins, and no more than two bishops
could be found who would impose their hands on his deacon and successor
Pelagius. Yet the perseverance of the popes insensibly transferred to
their adversaries the appellation of schismatics; the Illyrian, African,
and Italian churches were oppressed by the civil and ecclesiastical
powers, not without some effort of military force; <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> the distant
Barbarians transcribed the creed of the Vatican, and, in the period of a
century, the schism of the three chapters expired in an obscure angle of
the Venetian province. <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> But the religious discontent of the Italians
had already promoted the conquests of the Lombards, and the Romans
themselves were accustomed to suspect the faith and to detest the
government of their Byzantine tyrant.

Justinian was neither steady nor consistent in the nice process of
fixing his volatile opinions and those of his subjects. In his youth he
was, offended by the slightest deviation from the orthodox line; in
his old age he transgressed the measure of temperate heresy, and
the Jacobites, not less than the Catholics, were scandalized by his
declaration, that the body of Christ was incorruptible, and that his
manhood was never subject to any wants and infirmities, the inheritance
of our mortal flesh. This fantastic opinion was announced in the last
edicts of Justinian; and at the moment of his seasonable departure, the
clergy had refused to subscribe, the prince was prepared to persecute,
and the people were resolved to suffer or resist. A bishop of Treves,
secure beyond the limits of his power, addressed the monarch of the East
in the language of authority and affection. "Most gracious Justinian,
remember your baptism and your creed. Let not your gray hairs be defiled
with heresy. Recall your fathers from exile, and your followers from
perdition. You cannot be ignorant, that Italy and Gaul, Spain and
Africa, already deplore your fall, and anathematize your name. Unless,
without delay, you destroy what you have taught; unless you exclaim
with a loud voice, I have erred, I have sinned, anathema to Nestorius,
anathema to Eutyches, you deliver your soul to the same flames in which
they will eternally burn." He died and made no sign. <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> His death

The faculties of sense and reason are least capable of acting on
themselves; the eye is most inaccessible to the sight, the soul to the
thought; yet we think, and even feel, that one will, a sole principle of
action, is essential to a rational and conscious being. When Heraclius
returned from the Persian war, the orthodox hero consulted his bishops,
whether the Christ whom he adored, of one person, but of two natures,
was actuated by a single or a double will. They replied in the singular,
and the emperor was encouraged to hope that the Jacobites of Egypt
and Syria might be reconciled by the profession of a doctrine, most
certainly harmless, and most probably true, since it was taught even
by the Nestorians themselves. <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> The experiment was tried without
effect, and the timid or vehement Catholics condemned even the semblance
of a retreat in the presence of a subtle and audacious enemy. The
orthodox (the prevailing) party devised new modes of speech, and
argument, and interpretation: to either nature of Christ they speciously
applied a proper and distinct energy; but the difference was no longer
visible when they allowed that the human and the divine will were
invariably the same. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> The disease was attended with the customary
symptoms: but the Greek clergy, as if satiated with the endless
controversy of the incarnation, instilled a healing counsel into the
ear of the prince and people. They declared themselves Monothelites,
(asserters of the unity of will,) but they treated the words as new,
the questions as superfluous; and recommended a religious silence as the
most agreeable to the prudence and charity of the gospel. This law
of silence was successively imposed by the ecthesis or exposition of
Heraclius, the type or model of his grandson Constans; <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> and the
Imperial edicts were subscribed with alacrity or reluctance by the four
patriarchs of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch. But the
bishop and monks of Jerusalem sounded the alarm: in the language, or
even in the silence, of the Greeks, the Latin churches detected a
latent heresy: and the obedience of Pope Honorius to the commands of
his sovereign was retracted and censured by the bolder ignorance of his
successors. They condemned the execrable and abominable heresy of the
Monothelites, who revived the errors of Manes, Apollinaris, Eutyches,
&amp;c.; they signed the sentence of excommunication on the tomb of St.
Peter; the ink was mingled with the sacramental wine, the blood of
Christ; and no ceremony was omitted that could fill the superstitious
mind with horror and affright. As the representative of the Western
church, Pope Martin and his Lateran synod anathematized the perfidious
and guilty silence of the Greeks: one hundred and five bishops of Italy,
for the most part the subjects of Constans, presumed to reprobate
his wicked type, and the impious ecthesis of his grandfather; and to
confound the authors and their adherents with the twenty-one notorious
heretics, the apostates from the church, and the organs of the devil.
Such an insult under the tamest reign could not pass with impunity.
Pope Martin ended his days on the inhospitable shore of the Tauric
Chersonesus, and his oracle, the abbot Maximus, was inhumanly chastised
by the amputation of his tongue and his right hand. <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> But the same
invincible spirit survived in their successors; and the triumph of the
Latins avenged their recent defeat, and obliterated the disgrace of the
three chapters. The synods of Rome were confirmed by the sixth general
council of Constantinople, in the palace and the presence of a new
Constantine, a descendant of Heraclius. The royal convert converted the
Byzantine pontiff and a majority of the bishops; <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> the dissenters,
with their chief, Macarius of Antioch, were condemned to the spiritual
and temporal pains of heresy; the East condescended to accept the
lessons of the West; and the creed was finally settled, which teaches
the Catholics of every age, that two wills or energies are harmonized
in the person of Christ. The majesty of the pope and the Roman synod
was represented by two priests, one deacon, and three bishops; but these
obscure Latins had neither arms to compel, nor treasures to bribe,
nor language to persuade; and I am ignorant by what arts they could
determine the lofty emperor of the Greeks to abjure the catechism of his
infancy, and to persecute the religion of his fathers. Perhaps the monks
and people of Constantinople <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> were favorable to the Lateran creed,
which is indeed the least reasonable of the two: and the suspicion is
countenanced by the unnatural moderation of the Greek clergy, who appear
in this quarrel to be conscious of their weakness. While the synod
debated, a fanatic proposed a more summary decision, by raising a dead
man to life: the prelates assisted at the trial; but the acknowledged
failure may serve to indicate, that the passions and prejudices of the
multitude were not enlisted on the side of the Monothelites. In the next
generation, when the son of Constantine was deposed and slain by the
disciple of Macarius, they tasted the feast of revenge and dominion:
the image or monument of the sixth council was defaced, and the original
acts were committed to the flames. But in the second year, their patron
was cast headlong from the throne, the bishops of the East were released
from their occasional conformity, the Roman faith was more firmly
replanted by the orthodox successors of Bardanes, and the fine problems
of the incarnation were forgotten in the more popular and visible
quarrel of the worship of images. <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a>

<p>
Before the end of the seventh century, the creed of the incarnation,
which had been defined at Rome and Constantinople, was uniformly
preached in the remote islands of Britain and Ireland; <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> the same
ideas were entertained, or rather the same words were repeated, by all
the Christians whose liturgy was performed in the Greek or the Latin
tongue. Their numbers, and visible splendor, bestowed an imperfect claim
to the appellation of Catholics: but in the East, they were marked with
the less honorable name of Melchites, or Royalists; <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> of men,
whose faith, instead of resting on the basis of Scripture, reason,
or tradition, had been established, and was still maintained, by the
arbitrary power of a temporal monarch. Their adversaries might allege
the words of the fathers of Constantinople, who profess themselves the
slaves of the king; and they might relate, with malicious joy, how
the decrees of Chalcedon had been inspired and reformed by the emperor
Marcian and his virgin bride. The prevailing faction will naturally
inculcate the duty of submission, nor is it less natural that dissenters
should feel and assert the principles of freedom. Under the rod of
persecution, the Nestorians and Monophysites degenerated into rebels and
fugitives; and the most ancient and useful allies of Rome were taught
to consider the emperor not as the chief, but as the enemy of the
Christians. Language, the leading principle which unites or separates
the tribes of mankind, soon discriminated the sectaries of the East, by
a peculiar and perpetual badge, which abolished the means of intercourse
and the hope of reconciliation. The long dominion of the Greeks, their
colonies, and, above all, their eloquence, had propagated a language
doubtless the most perfect that has been contrived by the art of man.
Yet the body of the people, both in Syria and Egypt, still persevered
in the use of their national idioms; with this difference, however, that
the Coptic was confined to the rude and illiterate peasants of the Nile,
while the Syriac, <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> from the mountains of Assyria to the Red Sea,
was adapted to the higher topics of poetry and argument. Armenia and
Abyssinia were infected by the speech or learning of the Greeks; and
their Barbaric tongues, which have been revived in the studies of modern
Europe, were unintelligible to the inhabitants of the Roman empire. The
Syriac and the Coptic, the Armenian and the Aethiopic, are consecrated
in the service of their respective churches: and their theology is
enriched by domestic versions <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a> both of the Scriptures and of the
most popular fathers. After a period of thirteen hundred and sixty
years, the spark of controversy, first kindled by a sermon of Nestorius,
still burns in the bosom of the East, and the hostile communions still
maintain the faith and discipline of their founders. In the most
abject state of ignorance, poverty, and servitude, the Nestorians and
Monophysites reject the spiritual supremacy of Rome, and cherish the
toleration of their Turkish masters, which allows them to anathematize,
on the one hand, St. Cyril and the synod of Ephesus: on the other, Pope
Leo and the council of Chalcedon. The weight which they cast into the
downfall of the Eastern empire demands our notice, and the reader may
be amused with the various prospect of, I. The Nestorians; II. The
Jacobites; <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> III. The Maronites; IV. The Armenians; V. The Copts;
and, VI. The Abyssinians. To the three former, the Syriac is common; but
of the latter, each is discriminated by the use of a national idiom.
</p>
<p>
Yet the modern natives of Armenia and Abyssinia would be incapable of
conversing with their ancestors; and the Christians of Egypt and Syria,
who reject the religion, have adopted the language of the Arabians. The
lapse of time has seconded the sacerdotal arts; and in the East, as well
as in the West, the Deity is addressed in an obsolete tongue, unknown to
the majority of the congregation.

<h2>
    Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>
<p>
I. Both in his native and his episcopal province, the heresy of the
unfortunate Nestorius was speedily obliterated. The Oriental bishops,
who at Ephesus had resisted to his face the arrogance of Cyril,
were mollified by his tardy concessions. The same prelates, or their
successors, subscribed, not without a murmur, the decrees of Chalcedon;
the power of the Monophysites reconciled them with the Catholics in
the conformity of passion, of interest, and, insensibly, of belief;
and their last reluctant sigh was breathed in the defence of the three
chapters. Their dissenting brethren, less moderate, or more sincere,
were crushed by the penal laws; and, as early as the reign of Justinian,
it became difficult to find a church of Nestorians within the limits of
the Roman empire. Beyond those limits they had discovered a new world,
in which they might hope for liberty, and aspire to conquest. In Persia,
notwithstanding the resistance of the Magi, Christianity had struck a
deep root, and the nations of the East reposed under its salutary shade.
The catholic, or primate, resided in the capital: in his synods, and in
their dioceses, his metropolitans, bishops, and clergy, represented the
pomp and order of a regular hierarchy: they rejoiced in the increase of
proselytes, who were converted from the Zendavesta to the gospel, from
the secular to the monastic life; and their zeal was stimulated by the
presence of an artful and formidable enemy. The Persian church had been
founded by the missionaries of Syria; and their language, discipline,
and doctrine, were closely interwoven with its original frame. The
catholics were elected and ordained by their own suffragans; but their
filial dependence on the patriarchs of Antioch is attested by the canons
of the Oriental church. <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> In the Persian school of Edessa, <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> the
rising generations of the faithful imbibed their theological idiom: they
studied in the Syriac version the ten thousand volumes of Theodore of
Mopsuestia; and they revered the apostolic faith and holy martyrdom of
his disciple Nestorius, whose person and language were equally unknown
to the nations beyond the Tigris. The first indelible lesson of Ibas,
bishop of Edessa, taught them to execrate the Egyptians, who, in the
synod of Ephesus, had impiously confounded the two natures of Christ.
The flight of the masters and scholars, who were twice expelled from
the Athens of Syria, dispersed a crowd of missionaries inflamed by
the double zeal of religion and revenge. And the rigid unity of the
Monophysites, who, under the reigns of Zeno and Anastasius, had invaded
the thrones of the East, provoked their antagonists, in a land of
freedom, to avow a moral, rather than a physical, union of the two
persons of Christ. Since the first preaching of the gospel, the
Sassanian kings beheld with an eye of suspicion a race of aliens and
apostates, who had embraced the religion, and who might favor the cause,
of the hereditary foes of their country. The royal edicts had often
prohibited their dangerous correspondence with the Syrian clergy: the
progress of the schism was grateful to the jealous pride of Perozes, and
he listened to the eloquence of an artful prelate, who painted Nestorius
as the friend of Persia, and urged him to secure the fidelity of his
Christian subjects, by granting a just preference to the victims and
enemies of the Roman tyrant. The Nestorians composed a large majority of
the clergy and people: they were encouraged by the smile, and armed with
the sword, of despotism; yet many of their weaker brethren were startled
at the thought of breaking loose from the communion of the Christian
world, and the blood of seven thousand seven hundred Monophysites,
or Catholics, confirmed the uniformity of faith and discipline in
the churches of Persia. <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> Their ecclesiastical institutions are
distinguished by a liberal principle of reason, or at least of policy:
the austerity of the cloister was relaxed and gradually forgotten;
houses of charity were endowed for the education of orphans and
foundlings; the law of celibacy, so forcibly recommended to the Greeks
and Latins, was disregarded by the Persian clergy; and the number of
the elect was multiplied by the public and reiterated nuptials of the
priests, the bishops, and even the patriarch himself. To this standard
of natural and religious freedom, myriads of fugitives resorted from all
the provinces of the Eastern empire; the narrow bigotry of Justinian
was punished by the emigration of his most industrious subjects; they
transported into Persia the arts both of peace and war: and those
who deserved the favor, were promoted in the service, of a discerning
monarch. The arms of Nushirvan, and his fiercer grandson, were assisted
with advice, and money, and troops, by the desperate sectaries who still
lurked in their native cities of the East: their zeal was rewarded with
the gift of the Catholic churches; but when those cities and churches
were recovered by Heraclius, their open profession of treason and heresy
compelled them to seek a refuge in the realm of their foreign ally. But
the seeming tranquillity of the Nestorians was often endangered, and
sometimes overthrown. They were involved in the common evils of Oriental
despotism: their enmity to Rome could not always atone for their
attachment to the gospel: and a colony of three hundred thousand
Jacobites, the captives of Apamea and Antioch, was permitted to erect
a hostile altar in the face of the catholic, and in the sunshine of the
court. In his last treaty, Justinian introduced some conditions which
tended to enlarge and fortify the toleration of Christianity in Persia.
The emperor, ignorant of the rights of conscience, was incapable of pity
or esteem for the heretics who denied the authority of the holy synods:
but he flattered himself that they would gradually perceive the temporal
benefits of union with the empire and the church of Rome; and if
he failed in exciting their gratitude, he might hope to provoke the
jealousy of their sovereign. In a later age the Lutherans have been
burnt at Paris, and protected in Germany, by the superstition and policy
of the most Christian king.

The desire of gaining souls for God and subjects for the church, has
excited in every age the diligence of the Christian priests. From the
conquest of Persia they carried their spiritual arms to the north, the
east, and the south; and the simplicity of the gospel was fashioned and
painted with the colors of the Syriac theology. In the sixth century,
according to the report of a Nestorian traveller, <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> Christianity
was successfully preached to the Bactrians, the Huns, the Persians, the
Indians, the Persarmenians, the Medes, and the Elamites: the Barbaric
churches, from the Gulf of Persia to the Caspian Sea, were almost
infinite; and their recent faith was conspicuous in the number and
sanctity of their monks and martyrs. The pepper coast of Malabar,
and the isles of the ocean, Socotora and Ceylon, were peopled with an
increasing multitude of Christians; and the bishops and clergy of
those sequestered regions derived their ordination from the Catholic of
Babylon. In a subsequent age the zeal of the Nestorians overleaped the
limits which had confined the ambition and curiosity both of the Greeks
and Persians. The missionaries of Balch and Samarcand pursued without
fear the footsteps of the roving Tartar, and insinuated themselves into
the camps of the valleys of Imaus and the banks of the Selinga. They
exposed a metaphysical creed to those illiterate shepherds: to those
sanguinary warriors, they recommended humanity and repose. Yet a khan,
whose power they vainly magnified, is said to have received at their
hands the rites of baptism, and even of ordination; and the fame of
Prester or Presbyter John <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> has long amused the credulity of Europe.
The royal convert was indulged in the use of a portable altar; but he
despatched an embassy to the patriarch, to inquire how, in the season of
Lent, he should abstain from animal food, and how he might celebrate
the Eucharist in a desert that produced neither corn nor wine. In their
progress by sea and land, the Nestorians entered China by the port of
Canton and the northern residence of Sigan. Unlike the senators of
Rome, who assumed with a smile the characters of priests and augurs, the
mandarins, who affect in public the reason of philosophers, are devoted
in private to every mode of popular superstition. They cherished and
they confounded the gods of Palestine and of India; but the propagation
of Christianity awakened the jealousy of the state, and, after a short
vicissitude of favor and persecution, the foreign sect expired in
ignorance and oblivion. <a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a> Under the reign of the caliphs, the
Nestorian church was diffused from China to Jerusalem and Cyrus; and
their numbers, with those of the Jacobites, were computed to surpass
the Greek and Latin communions. <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a> Twenty-five metropolitans
or archbishops composed their hierarchy; but several of these were
dispensed, by the distance and danger of the way, from the duty of
personal attendance, on the easy condition that every six years they
should testify their faith and obedience to the catholic or patriarch of
Babylon, a vague appellation which has been successively applied to the
royal seats of Seleucia, Ctesiphon, and Bagdad. These remote branches
are long since withered; and the old patriarchal trunk <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> is now
divided by the Elijahs of Mosul, the representatives almost on lineal
descent of the genuine and primitive succession; the Josephs of Amida,
who are reconciled to the church of Rome: <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a> and the Simeons of Van
or Ormia, whose revolt, at the head of forty thousand families, was
promoted in the sixteenth century by the Sophis of Persia. The number of
three hundred thousand is allowed for the whole body of the Nestorians,
who, under the name of Chaldeans or Assyrians, are confounded with the
most learned or the most powerful nation of Eastern antiquity.

year 781, is accused of forgery by La Croze, Voltaire, &amp;c., who become
the dupes of their own cunning, while they are afraid of a Jesuitical
fraud. * Note: This famous monument, the authenticity of which many have
attempted to impeach, rather from hatred to the Jesuits, by whom it
was made known, than by a candid examination of its contents, is now
generally considered above all suspicion. The Chinese text and the facts
which it relates are equally strong proofs of its authenticity. This
monument was raised as a memorial of the establishment of Christianity
in China. It is dated the year 1092 of the era of the Greeks, or the
Seleucidae, A.D. 781, in the time of the Nestorian patriarch Anan-jesu.
It was raised by Iezdbouzid, priest and chorepiscopus of Chumdan, that
is, of the capital of the Chinese empire, and the son of a priest who
came from Balkh in Tokharistan. Among the various arguments which may be
urged in favor of the authenticity of this monument, and which has not
yet been advanced, may be reckoned the name of the priest by whom it
was raised. The name is Persian, and at the time the monument was
discovered, it would have been impossible to have imagined it; for there
was no work extant from whence the knowledge of it could be derived. I
do not believe that ever since this period, any book has been published
in which it can be found a second time. It is very celebrated amongst
the Armenians, and is derived from a martyr, a Persian by birth, of the
royal race, who perished towards the middle of the seventh century, and
rendered his name celebrated among the Christian nations of the East.

According to the legend of antiquity, the gospel was preached in India
by St. Thomas. <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> At the end of the ninth century, his shrine,
perhaps in the neighborhood of Madras, was devoutly visited by the
ambassadors of Alfred; and their return with a cargo of pearls and
spices rewarded the zeal of the English monarch, who entertained the
largest projects of trade and discovery. <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a> When the Portuguese first
opened the navigation of India, the Christians of St. Thomas had been
seated for ages on the coast of Malabar, and the difference of their
character and color attested the mixture of a foreign race. In arms, in
arts, and possibly in virtue, they excelled the natives of Hindostan;
the husbandmen cultivated the palm-tree, the merchants were enriched by
the pepper trade, the soldiers preceded the nairs or nobles of Malabar,
and their hereditary privileges were respected by the gratitude or the
fear of the king of Cochin and the Zamorin himself. They acknowledged a
Gentoo of sovereign, but they were governed, even in temporal concerns,
by the bishop of Angamala. He still asserted his ancient title of
metropolitan of India, but his real jurisdiction was exercised in
fourteen hundred churches, and he was intrusted with the care of two
hundred thousand souls. Their religion would have rendered them the
firmest and most cordial allies of the Portuguese; but the inquisitors
soon discerned in the Christians of St. Thomas the unpardonable guilt
of heresy and schism. Instead of owning themselves the subjects of the
Roman pontiff, the spiritual and temporal monarch of the globe, they
adhered, like their ancestors, to the communion of the Nestorian
patriarch; and the bishops whom he ordained at Mosul, traversed the
dangers of the sea and land to reach their diocese on the coast of
Malabar. In their Syriac liturgy the names of Theodore and Nestorius
were piously commemorated: they united their adoration of the two
persons of Christ; the title of Mother of God was offensive to their
ear, and they measured with scrupulous avarice the honors of the Virgin
Mary, whom the superstition of the Latins had almost exalted to the rank
of a goddess. When her image was first presented to the disciples of St.
Thomas, they indignantly exclaimed, "We are Christians, not idolaters!"
and their simple devotion was content with the veneration of the cross.
Their separation from the Western world had left them in ignorance
of the improvements, or corruptions, of a thousand years; and their
conformity with the faith and practice of the fifth century would
equally disappoint the prejudices of a Papist or a Protestant. It was
the first care of the ministers of Rome to intercept all correspondence
with the Nestorian patriarch, and several of his bishops expired in the
prisons of the holy office.
</p>
<p>
The flock, without a shepherd, was assaulted by the power of the
Portuguese, the arts of the Jesuits, and the zeal of Alexis de Menezes,
archbishop of Goa, in his personal visitation of the coast of Malabar.
The synod of Diamper, at which he presided, consummated the pious work
of the reunion; and rigorously imposed the doctrine and discipline of
the Roman church, without forgetting auricular confession, the strongest
engine of ecclesiastical torture. The memory of Theodore and Nestorius
was condemned, and Malabar was reduced under the dominion of the pope,
of the primate, and of the Jesuits who invaded the see of Angamala
or Cranganor. Sixty years of servitude and hypocrisy were patiently
endured; but as soon as the Portuguese empire was shaken by the courage
and industry of the Dutch, the Nestorians asserted, with vigor and
effect, the religion of their fathers. The Jesuits were incapable of
defending the power which they had abused; the arms of forty thousand
Christians were pointed against their falling tyrants; and the Indian
archdeacon assumed the character of bishop till a fresh supply of
episcopal gifts and Syriac missionaries could be obtained from the
patriarch of Babylon. Since the expulsion of the Portuguese, the
Nestorian creed is freely professed on the coast of Malabar. The trading
companies of Holland and England are the friends of toleration; but
if oppression be less mortifying than contempt, the Christians of St.
Thomas have reason to complain of the cold and silent indifference of
their brethren of Europe. <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a>

II. The history of the Monophysites is less copious and interesting than
that of the Nestorians. Under the reigns of Zeno and Anastasius, their
artful leaders surprised the ear of the prince, usurped the thrones of
the East, and crushed on its native soil the school of the Syrians. The
rule of the Monophysite faith was defined with exquisite discretion
by Severus, patriarch of Antioch: he condemned, in the style of the
Henoticon, the adverse heresies of Nestorius; and Eutyches maintained
against the latter the reality of the body of Christ, and constrained
the Greeks to allow that he was a liar who spoke truth. <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a> But the
approximation of ideas could not abate the vehemence of passion; each
party was the more astonished that their blind antagonist could dispute
on so trifling a difference; the tyrant of Syria enforced the belief of
his creed, and his reign was polluted with the blood of three hundred
and fifty monks, who were slain, not perhaps without provocation or
resistance, under the walls of Apamea. <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> The successor of Anastasius
replanted the orthodox standard in the East; Severus fled into Egypt;
and his friend, the eloquent Xenaias, <a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a> who had escaped from the
Nestorians of Persia, was suffocated in his exile by the Melchites of
Paphlagonia. Fifty-four bishops were swept from their thrones, eight
hundred ecclesiastics were cast into prison, <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> and notwithstanding
the ambiguous favor of Theodora, the Oriental flocks, deprived of their
shepherds, must insensibly have been either famished or poisoned. In
this spiritual distress, the expiring faction was revived, and united,
and perpetuated, by the labors of a monk; and the name of James
Baradaeus <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a> has been preserved in the appellation of Jacobites, a
familiar sound, which may startle the ear of an English reader. From
the holy confessors in their prison of Constantinople, he received the
powers of bishop of Edessa and apostle of the East, and the ordination
of fourscore thousand bishops, priests, and deacons, is derived from
the same inexhaustible source. The speed of the zealous missionary was
promoted by the fleetest dromedaries of a devout chief of the Arabs; the
doctrine and discipline of the Jacobites were secretly established in
the dominions of Justinian; and each Jacobite was compelled to violate
the laws and to hate the Roman legislator. The successors of Severus,
while they lurked in convents or villages, while they sheltered
their proscribed heads in the caverns of hermits, or the tents of the
Saracens, still asserted, as they now assert, their indefeasible right
to the title, the rank, and the prerogatives of patriarch of Antioch:
under the milder yoke of the infidels, they reside about a league
from Merdin, in the pleasant monastery of Zapharan, which they have
embellished with cells, aqueducts, and plantations. The secondary,
though honorable, place is filled by the maphrian, who, in his station
at Mosul itself, defies the Nestorian catholic with whom he contests the
primacy of the East. Under the patriarch and the maphrian, one hundred
and fifty archbishops and bishops have been counted in the different
ages of the Jacobite church; but the order of the hierarchy is relaxed
or dissolved, and the greater part of their dioceses is confined to the
neighborhood of the Euphrates and the Tigris. The cities of Aleppo and
Amida, which are often visited by the patriarch, contain some wealthy
merchants and industrious mechanics, but the multitude derive their
scanty sustenance from their daily labor: and poverty, as well as
superstition, may impose their excessive fasts: five annual lents,
during which both the clergy and laity abstain not only from flesh
or eggs, but even from the taste of wine, of oil, and of fish. Their
present numbers are esteemed from fifty to fourscore thousand souls, the
remnant of a populous church, which was gradually decreased under the
impression of twelve centuries. Yet in that long period, some strangers
of merit have been converted to the Monophysite faith, and a Jew was
the father of Abulpharagius, <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> primate of the East, so truly eminent
both in his life and death. In his life he was an elegant writer of the
Syriac and Arabic tongues, a poet, physician, and historian, a subtile
philosopher, and a moderate divine. In his death, his funeral was
attended by his rival the Nestorian patriarch, with a train of Greeks
and Armenians, who forgot their disputes, and mingled their tears over
the grave of an enemy. The sect which was honored by the virtues
of Abulpharagius appears, however, to sink below the level of their
Nestorian brethren. The superstition of the Jacobites is more abject,
their fasts more rigid, <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a> their intestine divisions are more
numerous, and their doctors (as far as I can measure the degrees of
nonsense) are more remote from the precincts of reason. Something may
possibly be allowed for the rigor of the Monophysite theology; much more
for the superior influence of the monastic order. In Syria, in Egypt,
in Ethiopia, the Jacobite monks have ever been distinguished by the
austerity of their penance and the absurdity of their legends. Alive or
dead, they are worshipped as the favorites of the Deity; the crosier
of bishop and patriarch is reserved for their venerable hands; and they
assume the government of men, while they are yet reeking with the habits
and prejudices of the cloister. <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a>

III. In the style of the Oriental Christians, the Monothelites of every
age are described under the appellation of Maronites, <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> a name which
has been insensibly transferred from a hermit to a monastery, from a
monastery to a nation. Maron, a saint or savage of the fifth century,
displayed his religious madness in Syria; the rival cities of Apamea and
Emesa disputed his relics, a stately church was erected on his tomb, and
six hundred of his disciples united their solitary cells on the banks
of the Orontes. In the controversies of the incarnation they nicely
threaded the orthodox line between the sects of Nestorians and Eutyches;
but the unfortunate question of one will or operation in the two natures
of Christ, was generated by their curious leisure. Their proselyte, the
emperor Heraclius, was rejected as a Maronite from the walls of
Emesa, he found a refuge in the monastery of his brethren; and their
theological lessons were repaid with the gift a spacious and wealthy
domain. The name and doctrine of this venerable school were propagated
among the Greeks and Syrians, and their zeal is expressed by Macarius,
patriarch of Antioch, who declared before the synod of Constantinople,
that sooner than subscribe the two wills of Christ, he would submit to
be hewn piecemeal and cast into the sea. <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a> A similar or a less
cruel mode of persecution soon converted the unresisting subjects of
the plain, while the glorious title of Mardaites, <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a> or rebels, was
bravely maintained by the hardy natives of Mount Libanus. John Maron,
one of the most learned and popular of the monks, assumed the character
of patriarch of Antioch; his nephew, Abraham, at the head of the
Maronites, defended their civil and religious freedom against the
tyrants of the East. The son of the orthodox Constantine pursued with
pious hatred a people of soldiers, who might have stood the bulwark of
his empire against the common foes of Christ and of Rome. An army of
Greeks invaded Syria; the monastery of St. Maron was destroyed with
fire; the bravest chieftains were betrayed and murdered, and twelve
thousand of their followers were transplanted to the distant frontiers
of Armenia and Thrace. Yet the humble nation of the Maronites had
survived the empire of Constantinople, and they still enjoy, under
their Turkish masters, a free religion and a mitigated servitude. Their
domestic governors are chosen among the ancient nobility: the patriarch,
in his monastery of Canobin, still fancies himself on the throne of
Antioch: nine bishops compose his synod, and one hundred and fifty
priests, who retain the liberty of marriage, are intrusted with the care
of one hundred thousand souls. Their country extends from the ridge of
Mount Libanus to the shores of Tripoli; and the gradual descent affords,
in a narrow space, each variety of soil and climate, from the Holy
Cedars, erect under the weight of snow, <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a> to the vine, the mulberry,
and the olive-trees of the fruitful valley. In the twelfth century, the
Maronites, abjuring the Monothelite error were reconciled to the Latin
churches of Antioch and Rome, <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a> and the same alliance has been
frequently renewed by the ambition of the popes and the distress of the
Syrians. But it may reasonably be questioned, whether their union has
ever been perfect or sincere; and the learned Maronites of the college
of Rome have vainly labored to absolve their ancestors from the guilt of
heresy and schism. <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a>

IV. Since the age of Constantine, the Armenians <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a> had signalized
their attachment to the religion and empire of the Christians. <a href="#note-1391" name="noteref-1391"><small>1391</small></a>
The disorders of their country, and their ignorance of the Greek tongue,
prevented their clergy from assisting at the synod of Chalcedon, and
they floated eighty-four years <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a> in a state of indifference
or suspense, till their vacant faith was finally occupied by the
missionaries of Julian of Halicarnassus, <a href="#note-141" name="noteref-141"><small>141</small></a> who in Egypt, their
common exile, had been vanquished by the arguments or the influence of
his rival Severus, the Monophysite patriarch of Antioch. The Armenians
alone are the pure disciples of Eutyches, an unfortunate parent, who has
been renounced by the greater part of his spiritual progeny. They alone
persevere in the opinion, that the manhood of Christ was created, or
existed without creation, of a divine and incorruptible substance. Their
adversaries reproach them with the adoration of a phantom; and they
retort the accusation, by deriding or execrating the blasphemy of the
Jacobites, who impute to the Godhead the vile infirmities of the flesh,
even the natural effects of nutrition and digestion. The religion of
Armenia could not derive much glory from the learning or the power of
its inhabitants. The royalty expired with the origin of their schism;
and their Christian kings, who arose and fell in the thirteenth century
on the confines of Cilicia, were the clients of the Latins and the
vassals of the Turkish sultan of Iconium. The helpless nation has seldom
been permitted to enjoy the tranquillity of servitude. From the earliest
period to the present hour, Armenia has been the theatre of perpetual
war: the lands between Tauris and Erivan were dispeopled by the
cruel policy of the Sophis; and myriads of Christian families were
transplanted, to perish or to propagate in the distant provinces of
Persia. Under the rod of oppression, the zeal of the Armenians is
fervent and intrepid; they have often preferred the crown of martyrdom
to the white turban of Mahomet; they devoutly hate the error and
idolatry of the Greeks; and their transient union with the Latins is not
less devoid of truth, than the thousand bishops, whom their patriarch
offered at the feet of the Roman pontiff. <a href="#note-142" name="noteref-142"><small>142</small></a> The catholic, or
patriarch, of the Armenians resides in the monastery of Ekmiasin, three
leagues from Erivan. Forty-seven archbishops, each of whom may claim the
obedience of four or five suffragans, are consecrated by his hand; but
the far greater part are only titular prelates, who dignify with their
presence and service the simplicity of his court. As soon as they have
performed the liturgy, they cultivate the garden; and our bishops will
hear with surprise, that the austerity of their life increases in just
proportion to the elevation of their rank.
</p>
<p>
In the fourscore thousand towns or villages of his spiritual empire, the
patriarch receives a small and voluntary tax from each person above the
age of fifteen; but the annual amount of six hundred thousand crowns
is insufficient to supply the incessant demands of charity and tribute.
Since the beginning of the last century, the Armenians have obtained a
large and lucrative share of the commerce of the East: in their return
from Europe, the caravan usually halts in the neighborhood of Erivan,
the altars are enriched with the fruits of their patient industry;
and the faith of Eutyches is preached in their recent congregations of
Barbary and Poland. <a href="#note-143" name="noteref-143"><small>143</small></a>

V. In the rest of the Roman empire, the despotism of the prince might
eradicate or silence the sectaries of an obnoxious creed. But the
stubborn temper of the Egyptians maintained their opposition to the
synod of Chalcedon, and the policy of Justinian condescended to expect
and to seize the opportunity of discord. The Monophysite church of
Alexandria <a href="#note-144" name="noteref-144"><small>144</small></a> was torn by the disputes of the corruptibles and
incorruptibles, and on the death of the patriarch, the two factions
upheld their respective candidates. <a href="#note-145" name="noteref-145"><small>145</small></a> Gaian was the disciple of
Julian, Theodosius had been the pupil of Severus: the claims of the
former were supported by the consent of the monks and senators, the city
and the province; the latter depended on the priority of his ordination,
the favor of the empress Theodora, and the arms of the eunuch Narses,
which might have been used in more honorable warfare. The exile of
the popular candidate to Carthage and Sardinia inflamed the ferment of
Alexandria; and after a schism of one hundred and seventy years, the
Gaianites still revered the memory and doctrine of their founder. The
strength of numbers and of discipline was tried in a desperate and
bloody conflict; the streets were filled with the dead bodies of
citizens and soldiers; the pious women, ascending the roofs of their
houses, showered down every sharp or ponderous utensil on the heads of
the enemy; and the final victory of Narses was owing to the flames, with
which he wasted the third capital of the Roman world. But the lieutenant
of Justinian had not conquered in the cause of a heretic; Theodosius
himself was speedily, though gently, removed; and Paul of Tanis, an
orthodox monk, was raised to the throne of Athanasius. The powers of
government were strained in his support; he might appoint or displace
the dukes and tribunes of Egypt; the allowance of bread, which
Diocletian had granted, was suppressed, the churches were shut, and a
nation of schismatics was deprived at once of their spiritual and carnal
food. In his turn, the tyrant was excommunicated by the zeal and revenge
of the people: and none except his servile Melchites would salute him as
a man, a Christian, or a bishop. Yet such is the blindness of ambition,
that, when Paul was expelled on a charge of murder, he solicited, with
a bribe of seven hundred pounds of gold, his restoration to the same
station of hatred and ignominy. His successor Apollinaris entered
the hostile city in military array, alike qualified for prayer or for
battle. His troops, under arms, were distributed through the streets;
the gates of the cathedral were guarded, and a chosen band was stationed
in the choir, to defend the person of their chief. He stood erect on
his throne, and, throwing aside the upper garment of a warrior, suddenly
appeared before the eyes of the multitude in the robes of patriarch of
Alexandria. Astonishment held them mute; but no sooner had Apollinaris
begun to read the tome of St. Leo, than a volley of curses, and
invectives, and stones, assaulted the odious minister of the emperor
and the synod. A charge was instantly sounded by the successor of the
apostles; the soldiers waded to their knees in blood; and two hundred
thousand Christians are said to have fallen by the sword: an incredible
account, even if it be extended from the slaughter of a day to the
eighteen years of the reign of Apollinaris. Two succeeding patriarchs,
Eulogius <a href="#note-146" name="noteref-146"><small>146</small></a> and John, <a href="#note-147" name="noteref-147"><small>147</small></a> labored in the conversion of heretics,
with arms and arguments more worthy of their evangelical profession. The
theological knowledge of Eulogius was displayed in many a volume, which
magnified the errors of Eutyches and Severus, and attempted to reconcile
the ambiguous language of St. Cyril with the orthodox creed of Pope
Leo and the fathers of Chalcedon. The bounteous alms of John the
eleemosynary were dictated by superstition, or benevolence, or policy.
Seven thousand five hundred poor were maintained at his expense; on his
accession he found eight thousand pounds of gold in the treasury of the
church; he collected ten thousand from the liberality of the faithful;
yet the primate could boast in his testament, that he left behind him
no more than the third part of the smallest of the silver coins. The
churches of Alexandria were delivered to the Catholics, the religion of
the Monophysites was proscribed in Egypt, and a law was revived which
excluded the natives from the honors and emoluments of the state.

<h2>
    Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.&mdash;Part VI.
</h2>
<p>
A more important conquest still remained, of the patriarch, the oracle
and leader of the Egyptian church. Theodosius had resisted the
threats and promises of Justinian with the spirit of an apostle or
an enthusiast. "Such," replied the patriarch, "were the offers of the
tempter when he showed the kingdoms of the earth. But my soul is far
dearer to me than life or dominion. The churches are in the hands of a
prince who can kill the body; but my conscience is my own; and in exile,
poverty, or chains, I will steadfastly adhere to the faith of my holy
predecessors, Athanasius, Cyril, and Dioscorus. Anathema to the tome of
Leo and the synod of Chalcedon! Anathema to all who embrace their creed!
Anathema to them now and forevermore! Naked came I out of my mother's
womb, naked shall I descend into the grave. Let those who love God
follow me and seek their salvation." After comforting his brethren,
he embarked for Constantinople, and sustained, in six successive
interviews, the almost irresistible weight of the royal presence. His
opinions were favorably entertained in the palace and the city;
the influence of Theodora assured him a safe conduct and honorable
dismission; and he ended his days, though not on the throne, yet in
the bosom, of his native country. On the news of his death, Apollinaris
indecently feasted the nobles and the clergy; but his joy was checked by
the intelligence of a new election; and while he enjoyed the wealth of
Alexandria, his rivals reigned in the monasteries of Thebais, and
were maintained by the voluntary oblations of the people. A perpetual
succession of patriarchs arose from the ashes of Theodosius; and the
Monophysite churches of Syria and Egypt were united by the name of
Jacobites and the communion of the faith. But the same faith, which has
been confined to a narrow sect of the Syrians, was diffused over the
mass of the Egyptian or Coptic nation; who, almost unanimously, rejected
the decrees of the synod of Chalcedon. A thousand years were now elapsed
since Egypt had ceased to be a kingdom, since the conquerors of Asia and
Europe had trampled on the ready necks of a people, whose ancient wisdom
and power ascend beyond the records of history. The conflict of zeal
and persecution rekindled some sparks of their national spirit. They
abjured, with a foreign heresy, the manners and language of the Greeks:
every Melchite, in their eyes, was a stranger, every Jacobite a citizen;
the alliance of marriage, the offices of humanity, were condemned as a
deadly sin the natives renounced all allegiance to the emperor; and
his orders, at a distance from Alexandria, were obeyed only under the
pressure of military force. A generous effort might have edeemed the
religion and liberty of Egypt, and her six hundred monasteries might
have poured forth their myriads of holy warriors, for whom death should
have no terrors, since life had no comfort or delight. But experience
has proved the distinction of active and passive courage; the fanatic
who endures without a groan the torture of the rack or the stake, would
tremble and fly before the face of an armed enemy. The pusillanimous
temper of the Egyptians could only hope for a change of masters; the
arms of Chosroes depopulated the land, yet under his reign the Jacobites
enjoyed a short and precarious respite. The victory of Heraclius renewed
and aggravated the persecution, and the patriarch again escaped from
Alexandria to the desert. In his flight, Benjamin was encouraged by
a voice, which bade him expect, at the end of ten years, the aid of a
foreign nation, marked, like the Egyptians themselves, with the ancient
rite of circumcision. The character of these deliverers, and the nature
of the deliverance, will be hereafter explained; and I shall step over
the interval of eleven centuries to observe the present misery of the
Jacobites of Egypt. The populous city of Cairo affords a residence, or
rather a shelter, for their indigent patriarch, and a remnant of ten
bishops; forty monasteries have survived the inroads of the Arabs; and
the progress of servitude and apostasy has reduced the Coptic nation to
the despicable number of twenty-five or thirty thousand families; <a href="#note-148" name="noteref-148"><small>148</small></a>

VI. The Coptic patriarch, a rebel to the Caesars, or a slave to the
khalifs, still gloried in the filial obedience of the kings of Nubia and
Aethiopia. He repaid their homage by magnifying their greatness; and
it was boldly asserted that they could bring into the field a hundred
thousand horse, with an equal number of camels; <a href="#note-150" name="noteref-150"><small>150</small></a> that their hand
could pour out or restrain the waters of the Nile; <a href="#note-151" name="noteref-151"><small>151</small></a> and the
peace and plenty of Egypt was obtained, even in this world, by the
intercession of the patriarch. In exile at Constantinople, Theodosius
recommended to his patroness the conversion of the black nations of
Nubia, from the tropic of Cancer to the confines of Abyssinia. <a href="#note-152" name="noteref-152"><small>152</small></a>
Her design was suspected and emulated by the more orthodox emperor.
The rival missionaries, a Melchite and a Jacobite, embarked at the
same time; but the empress, from a motive of love or fear, was more
effectually obeyed; and the Catholic priest was detained by the
president of Thebais, while the king of Nubia and his court were hastily
baptized in the faith of Dioscorus. The tardy envoy of Justinian was
received and dismissed with honor: but when he accused the heresy and
treason of the Egyptians, the negro convert was instructed to reply
that he would never abandon his brethren, the true believers, to the
persecuting ministers of the synod of Chalcedon. <a href="#note-153" name="noteref-153"><small>153</small></a> During several
ages, the bishops of Nubia were named and consecrated by the Jacobite
patriarch of Alexandria: as late as the twelfth century, Christianity
prevailed; and some rites, some ruins, are still visible in the savage
towns of Sennaar and Dongola. <a href="#note-154" name="noteref-154"><small>154</small></a> But the Nubians at length executed
their threats of returning to the worship of idols; the climate required
the indulgence of polygamy, and they have finally preferred the triumph
of the Koran to the abasement of the Cross. A metaphysical religion may
appear too refined for the capacity of the negro race: yet a black or
a parrot might be taught to repeat the words of the Chalcedonian or
Monophysite creed.

Christianity was more deeply rooted in the Abyssinian empire; and,
although the correspondence has been sometimes interrupted above seventy
or a hundred years, the mother-church of Alexandria retains her colony
in a state of perpetual pupilage. Seven bishops once composed the
Aethiopic synod: had their number amounted to ten, they might have
elected an independent primate; and one of their kings was ambitious of
promoting his brother to the ecclesiastical throne. But the event
was foreseen, the increase was denied: the episcopal office has been
gradually confined to the abuna, <a href="#note-155" name="noteref-155"><small>155</small></a> the head and author of the
Abyssinian priesthood; the patriarch supplies each vacancy with an
Egyptian monk; and the character of a stranger appears more venerable in
the eyes of the people, less dangerous in those of the monarch. In the
sixth century, when the schism of Egypt was confirmed, the rival chiefs,
with their patrons, Justinian and Theodora, strove to outstrip each
other in the conquest of a remote and independent province. The
industry of the empress was again victorious, and the pious Theodora has
established in that sequestered church the faith and discipline of
the Jacobites. <a href="#note-156" name="noteref-156"><small>156</small></a> Encompassed on all sides by the enemies of their
religion, the Aethiopians slept near a thousand years, forgetful of
the world, by whom they were forgotten. They were awakened by the
Portuguese, who, turning the southern promontory of Africa, appeared in
India and the Red Sea, as if they had descended through the air from a
distant planet. In the first moments of their interview, the subjects
of Rome and Alexandria observed the resemblance, rather than the
difference, of their faith; and each nation expected the most important
benefits from an alliance with their Christian brethren. In their lonely
situation, the Aethiopians had almost relapsed into the savage life.
Their vessels, which had traded to Ceylon, scarcely presumed to navigate
the rivers of Africa; the ruins of Axume were deserted, the nation was
scattered in villages, and the emperor, a pompous name, was content,
both in peace and war, with the immovable residence of a camp. Conscious
of their own indigence, the Abyssinians had formed the rational
project of importing the arts and ingenuity of Europe; <a href="#note-157" name="noteref-157"><small>157</small></a> and their
ambassadors at Rome and Lisbon were instructed to solicit a colony of
smiths, carpenters, tilers, masons, printers, surgeons, and physicians,
for the use of their country. But the public danger soon called for the
instant and effectual aid of arms and soldiers, to defend an unwarlike
people from the Barbarians who ravaged the inland country and the Turks
and Arabs who advanced from the sea-coast in more formidable array.
Aethiopia was saved by four hundred and fifty Portuguese, who displayed
in the field the native valor of Europeans, and the artificial power of
the musket and cannon. In a moment of terror, the emperor had promised
to reconcile himself and his subjects to the Catholic faith; a Latin
patriarch represented the supremacy of the pope: <a href="#note-158" name="noteref-158"><small>158</small></a> the empire,
enlarged in a tenfold proportion, was supposed to contain more gold than
the mines of America; and the wildest hopes of avarice and zeal were
built on the willing submission of the Christians of Africa.

But the vows which pain had extorted were forsworn on the return of
health. The Abyssinians still adhered with unshaken constancy to the
Monophysite faith; their languid belief was inflamed by the exercise
of dispute; they branded the Latins with the names of Arians and
Nestorians, and imputed the adoration of four gods to those who
separated the two natures of Christ. Fremona, a place of worship, or
rather of exile, was assigned to the Jesuit missionaries. Their skill
in the liberal and mechanic arts, their theological learning, and the
decency of their manners, inspired a barren esteem; but they were not
endowed with the gift of miracles, <a href="#note-159" name="noteref-159"><small>159</small></a> and they vainly solicited a
reenforcement of European troops. The patience and dexterity of forty
years at length obtained a more favorable audience, and two emperors
of Abyssinia were persuaded that Rome could insure the temporal and
everlasting happiness of her votaries. The first of these royal converts
lost his crown and his life; and the rebel army was sanctified by the
abuna, who hurled an anathema at the apostate, and absolved his subjects
from their oath of fidelity. The fate of Zadenghel was revenged by the
courage and fortune of Susneus, who ascended the throne under the name
of Segued, and more vigorously prosecuted the pious enterprise of his
kinsman. After the amusement of some unequal combats between the Jesuits
and his illiterate priests, the emperor declared himself a proselyte
to the synod of Chalcedon, presuming that his clergy and people would
embrace without delay the religion of their prince. The liberty of
choice was succeeded by a law, which imposed, under pain of death, the
belief of the two natures of Christ: the Abyssinians were enjoined to
work and to play on the Sabbath; and Segued, in the face of Europe and
Africa, renounced his connection with the Alexandrian church. A Jesuit,
Alphonso Mendez, the Catholic patriarch of Aethiopia, accepted, in
the name of Urban VIII., the homage and abjuration of the penitent. "I
confess," said the emperor on his knees, "I confess that the pope is the
vicar of Christ, the successor of St. Peter, and the sovereign of the
world. To him I swear true obedience, and at his feet I offer my person
and kingdom." A similar oath was repeated by his son, his brother,
the clergy, the nobles, and even the ladies of the court: the Latin
patriarch was invested with honors and wealth; and his missionaries
erected their churches or citadels in the most convenient stations of
the empire. The Jesuits themselves deplore the fatal indiscretion of
their chief, who forgot the mildness of the gospel and the policy of
his order, to introduce with hasty violence the liturgy of Rome and
the inquisition of Portugal. He condemned the ancient practice of
circumcision, which health, rather than superstition, had first invented
in the climate of Aethiopia. <a href="#note-160" name="noteref-160"><small>160</small></a> A new baptism, a new ordination, was
inflicted on the natives; and they trembled with horror when the most
holy of the dead were torn from their graves, when the most illustrious
of the living were excommunicated by a foreign priest. In the defense of
their religion and liberty, the Abyssinians rose in arms, with desperate
but unsuccessful zeal. Five rebellions were extinguished in the blood
of the insurgents: two abunas were slain in battle, whole legions were
slaughtered in the field, or suffocated in their caverns; and neither
merit, nor rank, nor sex, could save from an ignominious death the
enemies of Rome. But the victorious monarch was finally subdued by the
constancy of the nation, of his mother, of his son, and of his most
faithful friends. Segued listened to the voice of pity, of reason,
perhaps of fear: and his edict of liberty of conscience instantly
revealed the tyranny and weakness of the Jesuits. On the death of his
father, Basilides expelled the Latin patriarch, and restored to
the wishes of the nation the faith and the discipline of Egypt. The
Monophysite churches resounded with a song of triumph, "that the sheep
of Aethiopia were now delivered from the hyaenas of the West;" and the
gates of that solitary realm were forever shut against the arts, the
science, and the fanaticism of Europe. <a href="#note-161" name="noteref-161"><small>161</small></a>

a slight, advantage from the Aethiopic language, and the personal

he invited from Rome to the court of Saxe-Gotha. See the Theologia
