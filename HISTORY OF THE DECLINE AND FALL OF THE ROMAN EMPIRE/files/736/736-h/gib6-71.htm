</pre>
<p>
In the last days of Pope Eugenius the Fourth, <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> two of his servants,
the learned Poggius <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> and a friend, ascended the Capitoline hill;
reposed themselves among the ruins of columns and temples; and viewed
from that commanding spot the wide and various prospect of desolation.
<a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> The place and the object gave ample scope for moralizing on the
vicissitudes of fortune, which spares neither man nor the proudest of
his works, which buries empires and cities in a common grave; and it was
agreed, that in proportion to her former greatness, the fall of Rome was
the more awful and deplorable. "Her primeval state, such as she might
appear in a remote age, when Evander entertained the stranger of Troy,
<a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> has been delineated by the fancy of Virgil. This Tarpeian rock was
then a savage and solitary thicket: in the time of the poet, it was
crowned with the golden roofs of a temple; the temple is overthrown,
the gold has been pillaged, the wheel of fortune has accomplished her
revolution, and the sacred ground is again disfigured with thorns and
brambles. The hill of the Capitol, on which we sit, was formerly the
head of the Roman empire, the citadel of the earth, the terror of kings;
illustrated by the footsteps of so many triumphs, enriched with the
spoils and tributes of so many nations. This spectacle of the world,
how is it fallen! how changed! how defaced! The path of victory is
obliterated by vines, and the benches of the senators are concealed by
a dunghill. Cast your eyes on the Palatine hill, and seek among the
shapeless and enormous fragments the marble theatre, the obelisks, the
colossal statues, the porticos of Nero's palace: survey the other hills
of the city, the vacant space is interrupted only by ruins and gardens.
The forum of the Roman people, where they assembled to enact their laws
and elect their magistrates, is now enclosed for the cultivation of
pot-herbs, or thrown open for the reception of swine and buffaloes.
The public and private edifices, that were founded for eternity, lie
prostrate, naked, and broken, like the limbs of a mighty giant; and the
ruin is the more visible, from the stupendous relics that have survived
the injuries of time and fortune." <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a>

<p>
These relics are minutely described by Poggius, one of the first who
raised his eyes from the monuments of legendary, to those of classic,
superstition. <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> <i>1.</i>Besides a bridge, an arch, a sepulchre, and the
pyramid of Cestius, he could discern, of the age of the republic, a
double row of vaults, in the salt-office of the Capitol, which were
inscribed with the name and munificence of Catulus. <i>2.</i> Eleven temples
were visible in some degree, from the perfect form of the Pantheon,
to the three arches and a marble column of the temple of Peace, which
Vespasian erected after the civil wars and the Jewish triumph. <i>3.</i> Of
the number, which he rashly defines, of seven <i>therm</i>, or public baths,
none were sufficiently entire to represent the use and distribution of
the several parts: but those of Diocletian and Antoninus Caracalla
still retained the titles of the founders, and astonished the curious
spectator, who, in observing their solidity and extent, the variety of
marbles, the size and multitude of the columns, compared the labor and
expense with the use and importance. Of the baths of Constantine, of
Alexander, of Domitian, or rather of Titus, some vestige might yet be
found. <i>4.</i> The triumphal arches of Titus, Severus, and Constantine,
were entire, both the structure and the inscriptions; a falling fragment
was honored with the name of Trajan; and two arches, then extant, in the
Flaminian way, have been ascribed to the baser memory of Faustina and
Gallienus. <a href="#note-501" name="noteref-501"><small>501</small></a> <i>5.</i> After the wonder of the Coliseum, Poggius might have
overlooked small amphitheatre of brick, most probably for the use of the
prætorian camp: the theatres of Marcellus and Pompey were occupied in
a great measure by public and private buildings; and in the Circus,
Agonalis and Maximus, little more than the situation and the form could
be investigated. <i>6.</i> The columns of Trajan and Antonine were still
erect; but the Egyptian obelisks were broken or buried. A people of gods
and heroes, the workmanship of art, was reduced to one equestrian figure
of gilt brass, and to five marble statues, of which the most conspicuous
were the two horses of Phidias and Praxiteles. <i>7.</i> The two mausoleums
or sepulchres of Augustus and Hadrian could not totally be lost: but the
former was only visible as a mound of earth; and the latter, the
castle of St. Angelo, had acquired the name and appearance of a modern
fortress. With the addition of some separate and nameless columns, such
were the remains of the ancient city; for the marks of a more recent
structure might be detected in the walls, which formed a circumference
of ten miles, included three hundred and seventy-nine turrets, and
opened into the country by thirteen gates.

</p>
<p>
This melancholy picture was drawn above nine hundred years after the
fall of the Western empire, and even of the Gothic kingdom of Italy.
A long period of distress and anarchy, in which empire, and arts,
and riches had migrated from the banks of the Tyber, was incapable
of restoring or adorning the city; and, as all that is human must
retrograde if it do not advance, every successive age must have hastened
the ruin of the works of antiquity. To measure the progress of decay,
and to ascertain, at each æra, the state of each edifice, would be
an endless and a useless labor; and I shall content myself with two
observations, which will introduce a short inquiry into the general
causes and effects. <i>1.</i> Two hundred years before the eloquent complaint
of Poggius, an anonymous writer composed a description of Rome. <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> His
ignorance may repeat the same objects under strange and fabulous names.
Yet this barbarous topographer had eyes and ears; he could observe the
visible remains; he could listen to the tradition of the people; and he
distinctly enumerates seven theatres, eleven baths, twelve arches,
and eighteen palaces, of which many had disappeared before the time
of Poggius. It is apparent, that many stately monuments of antiquity
survived till a late period, <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> and that the principles of destruction
acted with vigorous and increasing energy in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries. <i>2.</i> The same reflection must be applied to the
three last ages; and we should vainly seek the Septizonium of Severus;
<a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> which is celebrated by Petrarch and the antiquarians of the sixteenth
century. While the Roman edifices were still entire, the first blows,
however weighty and impetuous, were resisted by the solidity of the mass
and the harmony of the parts; but the slightest touch would precipitate
the fragments of arches and columns, that already nodded to their fall.

</p>
<p>
After a diligent inquiry, I can discern four principal causes of the
ruin of Rome, which continued to operate in a period of more than a
thousand years. I. The injuries of time and nature. II. The hostile
attacks of the Barbarians and Christians. III. The use and abuse of the
materials. And, IV. The domestic quarrels of the Romans.
</p>
<p>
I. The art of man is able to construct monuments far more permanent than
the narrow span of his own existence; yet these monuments, like himself,
are perishable and frail; and in the boundless annals of time, his
life and his labors must equally be measured as a fleeting moment. Of a
simple and solid edifice, it is not easy, however, to circumscribe the
duration. As the wonders of ancient days, the pyramids <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> attracted the
curiosity of the ancients: a hundred generations, the leaves of autumn,
have dropped <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> into the grave; and after the fall of the Pharaohs and
Ptolemies, the Cæsars and caliphs, the same pyramids stand erect and
unshaken above the floods of the Nile. A complex figure of various and
minute parts to more accessible to injury and decay; and the silent
lapse of time is often accelerated by hurricanes and earthquakes, by
fires and inundations. The air and earth have doubtless been shaken; and
the lofty turrets of Rome have tottered from their foundations; but
the seven hills do not appear to be placed on the great cavities of the
globe; nor has the city, in any age, been exposed to the convulsions of
nature, which, in the climate of Antioch, Lisbon, or Lima, have crumbled
in a few moments the works of ages into dust. Fire is the most
powerful agent of life and death: the rapid mischief may be kindled and
propagated by the industry or negligence of mankind; and every period
of the Roman annals is marked by the repetition of similar calamities.
A memorable conflagration, the guilt or misfortune of Nero's reign,
continued, though with unequal fury, either six or nine days. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a>
Innumerable buildings, crowded in close and crooked streets, supplied
perpetual fuel for the flames; and when they ceased, four only of the
fourteen regions were left entire; three were totally destroyed, and
seven were deformed by the relics of smoking and lacerated edifices. <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a>
In the full meridian of empire, the metropolis arose with fresh beauty
from her ashes; yet the memory of the old deplored their irreparable
losses, the arts of Greece, the trophies of victory, the monuments of
primitive or fabulous antiquity. In the days of distress and anarchy,
every wound is mortal, every fall irretrievable; nor can the damage be
restored either by the public care of government, or the activity
of private interest. Yet two causes may be alleged, which render the
calamity of fire more destructive to a flourishing than a decayed city.
<i>1.</i> The more combustible materials of brick, timber, and metals, are
first melted or consumed; but the flames may play without injury or
effect on the naked walls, and massy arches, that have been despoiled of
their ornaments. <i>2.</i> It is among the common and plebeian habitations,
that a mischievous spark is most easily blown to a conflagration; but as
soon as they are devoured, the greater edifices, which have resisted or
escaped, are left as so many islands in a state of solitude and
safety. From her situation, Rome is exposed to the danger of frequent
inundations. Without excepting the Tyber, the rivers that descend from
either side of the Apennine have a short and irregular course; a shallow
stream in the summer heats; an impetuous torrent, when it is swelled in
the spring or winter, by the fall of rain, and the melting of the snows.
When the current is repelled from the sea by adverse winds, when the
ordinary bed is inadequate to the weight of waters, they rise above the
banks, and overspread, without limits or control, the plains and cities
of the adjacent country. Soon after the triumph of the first Punic war,
the Tyber was increased by unusual rains; and the inundation, surpassing
all former measure of time and place, destroyed all the buildings that
were situated below the hills of Rome. According to the variety of
ground, the same mischief was produced by different means; and the
edifices were either swept away by the sudden impulse, or dissolved and
undermined by the long continuance, of the flood. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> Under the reign
of Augustus, the same calamity was renewed: the lawless river overturned
the palaces and temples on its banks; <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> and, after the labors of
the emperor in cleansing and widening the bed that was encumbered with
ruins, <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> the vigilance of his successors was exercised by similar
dangers and designs. The project of diverting into new channels the
Tyber itself, or some of the dependent streams, was long opposed by
superstition and local interests; <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> nor did the use compensate the
toil and cost of the tardy and imperfect execution. The servitude of
rivers is the noblest and most important victory which man has obtained
over the licentiousness of nature; <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> and if such were the ravages of
the Tyber under a firm and active government, what could oppose, or who
can enumerate, the injuries of the city, after the fall of the Western
empire? A remedy was at length produced by the evil itself: the
accumulation of rubbish and the earth, that has been washed down from
the hills, is supposed to have elevated the plain of Rome, fourteen or
fifteen feet, perhaps, above the ancient level; <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> and the modern city
is less accessible to the attacks of the river. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a>

II. The crowd of writers of every nation, who impute the destruction of
the Roman monuments to the Goths and the Christians, have neglected to
inquire how far they were animated by a hostile principle, and how far
they possessed the means and the leisure to satiate their enmity. In
the preceding volumes of this History, I have described the triumph of
barbarism and religion; and I can only resume, in a few words, their
real or imaginary connection with the ruin of ancient Rome. Our fancy
may create, or adopt, a pleasing romance, that the Goths and Vandals
sallied from Scandinavia, ardent to avenge the flight of Odin; <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> to
break the chains, and to chastise the oppressors, of mankind; that they
wished to burn the records of classic literature, and to found their
national architecture on the broken members of the Tuscan and Corinthian
orders. But in simple truth, the northern conquerors were neither
sufficiently savage, nor sufficiently refined, to entertain such
aspiring ideas of destruction and revenge. The shepherds of Scythia and
Germany had been educated in the armies of the empire, whose discipline
they acquired, and whose weakness they invaded: with the familiar use of
the Latin tongue, they had learned to reverence the name and titles of
Rome; and, though incapable of emulating, they were more inclined to
admire, than to abolish, the arts and studies of a brighter period. In
the transient possession of a rich and unresisting capital, the soldiers
of Alaric and Genseric were stimulated by the passions of a victorious
army; amidst the wanton indulgence of lust or cruelty, portable wealth
was the object of their search; nor could they derive either pride or
pleasure from the unprofitable reflection, that they had battered to the
ground the works of the consuls and Cæsars. Their moments were indeed
precious; the Goths evacuated Rome on the sixth, <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> the Vandals on the
fifteenth, day: <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> and, though it be far more difficult to build than
to destroy, their hasty assault would have made a slight impression
on the solid piles of antiquity. We may remember, that both Alaric
and Genseric affected to spare the buildings of the city; that they
subsisted in strength and beauty under the auspicious government of
Theodoric; <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> and that the momentary resentment of Totila <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> was
disarmed by his own temper and the advice of his friends and enemies.
From these innocent Barbarians, the reproach may be transferred to the
Catholics of Rome. The statues, altars, and houses, of the dæmons, were
an abomination in their eyes; and in the absolute command of the city,
they might labor with zeal and perseverance to erase the idolatry of
their ancestors. The demolition of the temples in the East <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> affords
to <i>them</i> an example of conduct, and to <i>us</i> an argument of belief;
and it is probable that a portion of guilt or merit may be imputed with
justice to the Roman proselytes. Yet their abhorrence was confined to
the monuments of heathen superstition; and the civil structures that
were dedicated to the business or pleasure of society might be preserved
without injury or scandal. The change of religion was accomplished, not
by a popular tumult, but by the decrees of the emperors, of the senate,
and of time. Of the Christian hierarchy, the bishops of Rome were
commonly the most prudent and least fanatic; nor can any positive charge
be opposed to the meritorious act of saving or converting the majestic
structure of the Pantheon. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> <a href="#note-261" name="noteref-261"><small>261</small></a>

III. The value of any object that supplies the wants or pleasures of
mankind is compounded of its substance and its form, of the materials
and the manufacture. Its price must depend on the number of persons
by whom it may be acquired and used; on the extent of the market; and
consequently on the ease or difficulty of remote exportation, according
to the nature of the commodity, its local situation, and the temporary
circumstances of the world. The Barbarian conquerors of Rome usurped
in a moment the toil and treasure of successive ages; but, except the
luxuries of immediate consumption, they must view without desire all
that could not be removed from the city in the Gothic wagons or the
fleet of the Vandals. <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> Gold and silver were the first objects of
their avarice; as in every country, and in the smallest compass, they
represent the most ample command of the industry and possessions of
mankind. A vase or a statue of those precious metals might tempt the
vanity of some Barbarian chief; but the grosser multitude, regardless
of the form, was tenacious only of the substance; and the melted ingots
might be readily divided and stamped into the current coin of the
empire. The less active or less fortunate robbers were reduced to the
baser plunder of brass, lead, iron, and copper: whatever had escaped
the Goths and Vandals was pillaged by the Greek tyrants; and the emperor
Constans, in his rapacious visit, stripped the bronze tiles from the
roof of the Pantheon. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> The edifices of Rome might be considered as a
vast and various mine; the first labor of extracting the materials was
already performed; the metals were purified and cast; the marbles
were hewn and polished; and after foreign and domestic rapine had been
satiated, the remains of the city, could a purchaser have been found,
were still venal. The monuments of antiquity had been left naked of
their precious ornaments; but the Romans would demolish with their own
hands the arches and walls, if the hope of profit could surpass the cost
of the labor and exportation. If Charlemagne had fixed in Italy the seat
of the Western empire, his genius would have aspired to restore, rather
than to violate, the works of the Cæsars; but policy confined the French
monarch to the forests of Germany; his taste could be gratified only by
destruction; and the new palace of Aix la Chapelle was decorated with
the marbles of Ravenna <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> and Rome. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> Five hundred years after
Charlemagne, a king of Sicily, Robert, the wisest and most liberal
sovereign of the age, was supplied with the same materials by the easy
navigation of the Tyber and the sea; and Petrarch sighs an indignant
complaint, that the ancient capital of the world should adorn from her
own bowels the slothful luxury of Naples. <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> But these examples of
plunder or purchase were rare in the darker ages; and the Romans, alone
and unenvied, might have applied to their private or public use
the remaining structures of antiquity, if in their present form and
situation they had not been useless in a great measure to the city and
its inhabitants. The walls still described the old circumference, but
the city had descended from the seven hills into the Campus Martius; and
some of the noblest monuments which had braved the injuries of time
were left in a desert, far remote from the habitations of mankind.
The palaces of the senators were no longer adapted to the manners or
fortunes of their indigent successors: the use of baths <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> and
porticos was forgotten: in the sixth century, the games of the theatre,
amphitheatre, and circus, had been interrupted: some temples were
devoted to the prevailing worship; but the Christian churches preferred
the holy figure of the cross; and fashion, or reason, had distributed
after a peculiar model the cells and offices of the cloister. Under
the ecclesiastical reign, the number of these pious foundations was
enormously multiplied; and the city was crowded with forty monasteries
of men, twenty of women, and sixty chapters and colleges of canons and
priests, <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> who aggravated, instead of relieving, the depopulation
of the tenth century. But if the forms of ancient architecture were
disregarded by a people insensible of their use and beauty, the
plentiful materials were applied to every call of necessity or
superstition; till the fairest columns of the Ionic and Corinthian
orders, the richest marbles of Paros and Numidia, were degraded, perhaps
to the support of a convent or a stable. The daily havoc which is
perpetrated by the Turks in the cities of Greece and Asia may afford a
melancholy example; and in the gradual destruction of the monuments of
Rome, Sixtus the Fifth may alone be excused for employing the stones of
the Septizonium in the glorious edifice of St. Peter's. <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> A fragment,
a ruin, howsoever mangled or profaned, may be viewed with pleasure and
regret; but the greater part of the marble was deprived of substance, as
well as of place and proportion; it was burnt to lime for the purpose of
cement. <a href="#note-341" name="noteref-341"><small>341</small></a> Since the arrival of Poggius, the temple of Concord, <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> and
many capital structures, had vanished from his eyes; and an epigram of
the same age expresses a just and pious fear, that the continuance of
this practice would finally annihilate all the monuments of antiquity.
<a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> The smallness of their numbers was the sole check on the demands and
depredations of the Romans. The imagination of Petrarch might create the
presence of a mighty people; <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> and I hesitate to believe, that, even
in the fourteenth century, they could be reduced to a contemptible list
of thirty-three thousand inhabitants. From that period to the reign of
Leo the Tenth, if they multiplied to the amount of eighty-five thousand,
<a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> the increase of citizens was in some degree pernicious to the
ancient city.

IV. I have reserved for the last, the most potent and forcible cause of
destruction, the domestic hostilities of the Romans themselves. Under
the dominion of the Greek and French emperors, the peace of the city
was disturbed by accidental, though frequent, seditions: it is from the
decline of the latter, from the beginning of the tenth century, that we
may date the licentiousness of private war, which violated with impunity
the laws of the Code and the Gospel, without respecting the majesty of
the absent sovereign, or the presence and person of the vicar of Christ.
In a dark period of five hundred years, Rome was perpetually afflicted
by the sanguinary quarrels of the nobles and the people, the Guelphs
and Ghibelines, the Colonna and Ursini; and if much has escaped the
knowledge, and much is unworthy of the notice, of history, I have
exposed in the two preceding chapters the causes and effects of the
public disorders. At such a time, when every quarrel was decided by the
sword, and none could trust their lives or properties to the impotence
of law, the powerful citizens were armed for safety, or offence, against
the domestic enemies whom they feared or hated. Except Venice alone, the
same dangers and designs were common to all the free republics of Italy;
and the nobles usurped the prerogative of fortifying their houses, and
erecting strong towers, <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> that were capable of resisting a sudden
attack. The cities were filled with these hostile edifices; and the
example of Lucca, which contained three hundred towers; her law, which
confined their height to the measure of fourscore feet, may be extended
with suitable latitude to the more opulent and populous states. The
first step of the senator Brancaleone in the establishment of peace and
justice, was to demolish (as we have already seen) one hundred and forty
of the towers of Rome; and, in the last days of anarchy and discord, as
late as the reign of Martin the Fifth, forty-four still stood in one
of the thirteen or fourteen regions of the city. To this mischievous
purpose the remains of antiquity were most readily adapted: the temples
and arches afforded a broad and solid basis for the new structures of
brick and stone; and we can name the modern turrets that were raised on
the triumphal monuments of Julius Cæsar, Titus, and the Antonines. <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a>
With some slight alterations, a theatre, an amphitheatre, a mausoleum,
was transformed into a strong and spacious citadel. I need not repeat,
that the mole of Adrian has assumed the title and form of the castle
of St. Angelo; <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> the Septizonium of Severus was capable of standing
against a royal army; <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> the sepulchre of Metella has sunk under its
outworks; <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> <a href="#note-431" name="noteref-431"><small>431</small></a> the theatres of Pompey and Marcellus were occupied by
the Savelli and Ursini families; <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> and the rough fortress has been
gradually softened to the splendor and elegance of an Italian palace.
Even the churches were encompassed with arms and bulwarks, and the
military engines on the roof of St. Peter's were the terror of the
Vatican and the scandal of the Christian world. Whatever is fortified
will be attacked; and whatever is attacked may be destroyed. Could the
Romans have wrested from the popes the castle of St. Angelo, they had
resolved by a public decree to annihilate that monument of servitude.
Every building of defence was exposed to a siege; and in every siege
the arts and engines of destruction were laboriously employed. After the
death of Nicholas the Fourth, Rome, without a sovereign or a senate,
was abandoned six months to the fury of civil war. "The houses," says
a cardinal and poet of the times, <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> "were crushed by the weight
and velocity of enormous stones; <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> the walls were perforated by the
strokes of the battering-ram; the towers were involved in fire and
smoke; and the assailants were stimulated by rapine and revenge." The
work was consummated by the tyranny of the laws; and the factions of
Italy alternately exercised a blind and thoughtless vengeance on their
adversaries, whose houses and castles they razed to the ground. <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> In
comparing the <i>days</i> of foreign, with the <i>ages</i> of domestic, hostility,
we must pronounce, that the latter have been far more ruinous to
the city; and our opinion is confirmed by the evidence of Petrarch.
"Behold," says the laureate, "the relics of Rome, the image of her
pristine greatness! neither time nor the Barbarian can boast the merit
of this stupendous destruction: it was perpetrated by her own citizens,
by the most illustrious of her sons; and your ancestors (he writes to
a noble Annabaldi) have done with the battering-ram what the Punic hero
could not accomplish with the sword." <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> The influence of the two last
principles of decay must in some degree be multiplied by each other;
since the houses and towers, which were subverted by civil war, required
by a new and perpetual supply from the monuments of antiquity. <a href="#note-481" name="noteref-481"><small>481</small></a>

    Chapter LXXI: Prospect Of The Ruins Of Rome In The Fifteenth Century.&mdash;Part II
</h2>
<p>
These general observations may be separately applied to the amphitheatre
of Titus, which has obtained the name of the Coliseum, <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> either from
its magnitude, or from Nero's colossal statue; an edifice, had it been
left to time and nature, which might perhaps have claimed an eternal
duration. The curious antiquaries, who have computed the numbers and
seats, are disposed to believe, that above the upper row of stone steps
the amphitheatre was encircled and elevated with several stages of
wooden galleries, which were repeatedly consumed by fire, and restored
by the emperors. Whatever was precious, or portable, or profane, the
statues of gods and heroes, and the costly ornaments of sculpture which
were cast in brass, or overspread with leaves of silver and gold,
became the first prey of conquest or fanaticism, of the avarice of the
Barbarians or the Christians. In the massy stones of the Coliseum, many
holes are discerned; and the two most probable conjectures represent
the various accidents of its decay. These stones were connected by solid
links of brass or iron, nor had the eye of rapine overlooked the value
of the baser metals; <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> the vacant space was converted into a fair or
market; the artisans of the Coliseum are mentioned in an ancient survey;
and the chasms were perforated or enlarged to receive the poles that
supported the shops or tents of the mechanic trades. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> Reduced to its
naked majesty, the Flavian amphitheatre was contemplated with awe and
admiration by the pilgrims of the North; and their rude enthusiasm
broke forth in a sublime proverbial expression, which is recorded in the
eighth century, in the fragments of the venerable Bede: "As long as the
Coliseum stands, Rome shall stand; when the Coliseum falls, Rome will
fall; when Rome falls, the world will fall." <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> In the modern system
of war, a situation commanded by three hills would not be chosen for
a fortress; but the strength of the walls and arches could resist
the engines of assault; a numerous garrison might be lodged in the
enclosure; and while one faction occupied the Vatican and the Capitol,
the other was intrenched in the Lateran and the Coliseum. <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a>

The abolition at Rome of the ancient games must be understood with some
latitude; and the carnival sports, of the Testacean mount and the Circus
Agonalis, <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> were regulated by the law <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> or custom of the city. The
senator presided with dignity and pomp to adjudge and distribute the
prizes, the gold ring, or the <i>pallium</i>, <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> as it was styled, of cloth
or silk. A tribute on the Jews supplied the annual expense; <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> and the
races, on foot, on horseback, or in chariots, were ennobled by a tilt
and tournament of seventy-two of the Roman youth. In the year one
thousand three hundred and thirty-two, a bull-feast, after the fashion
of the Moors and Spaniards, was celebrated in the Coliseum itself; and
the living manners are painted in a diary of the times. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> A convenient
order of benches was restored; and a general proclamation, as far as
Rimini and Ravenna, invited the nobles to exercise their skill and
courage in this perilous adventure. The Roman ladies were marshalled in
three squadrons, and seated in three balconies, which, on this day, the
third of September, were lined with scarlet cloth. The fair Jacova di
Rovere led the matrons from beyond the Tyber, a pure and native race,
who still represent the features and character of antiquity. The
remainder of the city was divided as usual between the Colonna and
Ursini: the two factions were proud of the number and beauty of their
female bands: the charms of Savella Ursini are mentioned with praise;
and the Colonna regretted the absence of the youngest of their house,
who had sprained her ankle in the garden of Nero's tower. The lots of
the champions were drawn by an old and respectable citizen; and they
descended into the arena, or pit, to encounter the wild bulls, on foot
as it should seem, with a single spear. Amidst the crowd, our annalist
has selected the names, colors, and devices, of twenty of the most
conspicuous knights. Several of the names are the most illustrious of
Rome and the ecclesiastical state: Malatesta, Polenta, della Valle,
Cafarello, Savelli, Capoccio, Conti, Annibaldi, Altieri, Corsi: the
colors were adapted to their taste and situation; the devices are
expressive of hope or despair, and breathe the spirit of gallantry and
arms. "I am alone, like the youngest of the Horatii," the confidence of
an intrepid stranger: "I live disconsolate," a weeping widower: "I burn
under the ashes," a discreet lover: "I adore Lavinia, or Lucretia," the
ambiguous declaration of a modern passion: "My faith is as pure," the
motto of a white livery: "Who is stronger than myself?" of a lion's
hide: "If am drowned in blood, what a pleasant death!" the wish of
ferocious courage. The pride or prudence of the Ursini restrained them
from the field, which was occupied by three of their hereditary rivals,
whose inscriptions denoted the lofty greatness of the Colonna name:
"Though sad, I am strong:" "Strong as I am great:" "If I fall,"
addressing himself to the spectators, "you fall with me;"&mdash;intimating
(says the contemporary writer) that while the other families were the
subjects of the Vatican, they alone were the supporters of the Capitol.
The combats of the amphitheatre were dangerous and bloody. Every
champion successively encountered a wild bull; and the victory may be
ascribed to the quadrupeds, since no more than eleven were left on the
field, with the loss of nine wounded and eighteen killed on the side
of their adversaries. Some of the noblest families might mourn, but the
pomp of the funerals, in the churches of St. John Lateran and St. Maria
Maggiore, afforded a second holiday to the people. Doubtless it was not
in such conflicts that the blood of the Romans should have been shed;
yet, in blaming their rashness, we are compelled to applaud their
gallantry; and the noble volunteers, who display their magnificence,
and risk their lives, under the balconies of the fair, excite a more
generous sympathy than the thousands of captives and malefactors who
were reluctantly dragged to the scene of slaughter. <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a>

This use of the amphitheatre was a rare, perhaps a singular, festival:
the demand for the materials was a daily and continual want which the
citizens could gratify without restraint or remorse. In the fourteenth
century, a scandalous act of concord secured to both factions the
privilege of extracting stones from the free and common quarry of the
Coliseum; <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> and Poggius laments, that the greater part of these stones
had been burnt to lime by the folly of the Romans. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> To check this
abuse, and to prevent the nocturnal crimes that might be perpetrated
in the vast and gloomy recess, Eugenius the Fourth surrounded it with a
wall; and, by a charter long extant, granted both the ground and edifice
to the monks of an adjacent convent. <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> After his death, the wall was
overthrown in a tumult of the people; and had they themselves respected
the noblest monument of their fathers, they might have justified the
resolve that it should never be degraded to private property. The inside
was damaged: but in the middle of the sixteenth century, an æra of taste
and learning, the exterior circumference of one thousand six hundred
and twelve feet was still entire and inviolate; a triple elevation of
fourscore arches, which rose to the height of one hundred and eight
feet. Of the present ruin, the nephews of Paul the Third are the guilty
agents; and every traveller who views the Farnese palace may curse the
sacrilege and luxury of these upstart princes. <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> A similar reproach is
applied to the Barberini; and the repetition of injury might be dreaded
from every reign, till the Coliseum was placed under the safeguard of
religion by the most liberal of the pontiffs, Benedict the Fourteenth,
who consecrated a spot which persecution and fable had stained with the
blood of so many Christian martyrs. <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a>

When Petrarch first gratified his eyes with a view of those monuments,
whose scattered fragments so far surpass the most eloquent descriptions,
he was astonished at the supine indifference <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> of the Romans
themselves; <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> he was humbled rather than elated by the discovery,
that, except his friend Rienzi, and one of the Colonna, a stranger of
the Rhône was more conversant with these antiquities than the nobles and
natives of the metropolis. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> The ignorance and credulity of the
Romans are elaborately displayed in the old survey of the city which
was composed about the beginning of the thirteenth century; and, without
dwelling on the manifold errors of name and place, the legend of the
Capitol <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> may provoke a smile of contempt and indignation. "The
Capitol," says the anonymous writer, "is so named as being the head
of the world; where the consuls and senators formerly resided for the
government of the city and the globe. The strong and lofty walls were
covered with glass and gold, and crowned with a roof of the richest and
most curious carving. Below the citadel stood a palace, of gold for the
greatest part, decorated with precious stones, and whose value might
be esteemed at one third of the world itself. The statues of all the
provinces were arranged in order, each with a small bell suspended from
its neck; and such was the contrivance of art magic, <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> that if the
province rebelled against Rome, the statue turned round to that quarter
of the heavens, the bell rang, the prophet of the Capitol repeated
the prodigy, and the senate was admonished of the impending danger." A
second example, of less importance, though of equal absurdity, may be
drawn from the two marble horses, led by two naked youths, who have
since been transported from the baths of Constantine to the Quirinal
hill. The groundless application of the names of Phidias and Praxiteles
may perhaps be excused; but these Grecian sculptors should not have been
removed above four hundred years from the age of Pericles to that of
Tiberius; they should not have been transferred into two philosophers
or magicians, whose nakedness was the symbol of truth or knowledge, who
revealed to the emperor his most secret actions; and, after refusing
all pecuniary recompense, solicited the honor of leaving this eternal
monument of themselves. <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> Thus awake to the power of magic, the Romans
were insensible to the beauties of art: no more than five statues were
visible to the eyes of Poggius; and of the multitudes which chance or
design had buried under the ruins, the resurrection was fortunately
delayed till a safer and more enlightened age. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> The Nile which now
adorns the Vatican, had been explored by some laborers in digging a
vineyard near the temple, or convent, of the Minerva; but the impatient
proprietor, who was tormented by some visits of curiosity, restored the
unprofitable marble to its former grave. <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> The discovery of a statue
of Pompey, ten feet in length, was the occasion of a lawsuit. It had
been found under a partition wall: the equitable judge had pronounced,
that the head should be separated from the body to satisfy the claims of
the contiguous owners; and the sentence would have been executed, if
the intercession of a cardinal, and the liberality of a pope, had not
rescued the Roman hero from the hands of his barbarous countrymen. <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a>

But the clouds of barbarism were gradually dispelled; and the peaceful
authority of Martin the Fifth and his successors restored the ornaments
of the city as well as the order of the ecclesiastical state. The
improvements of Rome, since the fifteenth century, have not been the
spontaneous produce of freedom and industry. The first and most natural
root of a great city is the labor and populousness of the adjacent
country, which supplies the materials of subsistence, of manufactures,
and of foreign trade. But the greater part of the Campagna of Rome is
reduced to a dreary and desolate wilderness: the overgrown estates of
the princes and the clergy are cultivated by the lazy hands of indigent
and hopeless vassals; and the scanty harvests are confined or exported
for the benefit of a monopoly. A second and more artificial cause of the
growth of a metropolis is the residence of a monarch, the expense of
a luxurious court, and the tributes of dependent provinces. Those
provinces and tributes had been lost in the fall of the empire; and
if some streams of the silver of Peru and the gold of Brazil have been
attracted by the Vatican, the revenues of the cardinals, the fees
of office, the oblations of pilgrims and clients, and the remnant
of ecclesiastical taxes, afford a poor and precarious supply, which
maintains, however, the idleness of the court and city. The population
of Rome, far below the measure of the great capitals of Europe, does not
exceed one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants; <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> and within the
spacious enclosure of the walls, the largest portion of the seven hills
is overspread with vineyards and ruins. The beauty and splendor of the
modern city may be ascribed to the abuses of the government, to the
influence of superstition. Each reign (the exceptions are rare) has been
marked by the rapid elevation of a new family, enriched by the childish
pontiff at the expense of the church and country. The palaces of
these fortunate nephews are the most costly monuments of elegance and
servitude: the perfect arts of architecture, sculpture, and painting,
have been prostituted in their service; and their galleries and gardens
are decorated with the most precious works of antiquity, which taste or
vanity has prompted them to collect. The ecclesiastical revenues were
more decently employed by the popes themselves in the pomp of the
Catholic worship; but it is superfluous to enumerate their pious
foundations of altars, chapels, and churches, since these lesser stars
are eclipsed by the sun of the Vatican, by the dome of St. Peter,
the most glorious structure that ever has been applied to the use of
religion. The fame of Julius the Second, Leo the Tenth, and Sixtus the
Fifth, is accompanied by the superior merit of Bramante and Fontana,
of Raphael and Michael Angelo; and the same munificence which had been
displayed in palaces and temples was directed with equal zeal to revive
and emulate the labors of antiquity. Prostrate obelisks were raised from
the ground, and erected in the most conspicuous places; of the eleven
aqueducts of the Cæsars and consuls, three were restored; the artificial
rivers were conducted over a long series of old, or of new arches,
to discharge into marble basins a flood of salubrious and refreshing
waters: and the spectator, impatient to ascend the steps of St. Peter's,
is detained by a column of Egyptian granite, which rises between two
lofty and perpetual fountains, to the height of one hundred and twenty
feet. The map, the description, the monuments of ancient Rome, have been
elucidated by the diligence of the antiquarian and the student: <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> and
the footsteps of heroes, the relics, not of superstition, but of empire,
are devoutly visited by a new race of pilgrims from the remote, and once
savage countries of the North.

[ In the year 1709, the inhabitants of Rome (without
including eight or ten thousand Jews,) amounted to 138,568 souls, (Labat
Voyages en Espagne et en Italie, tom. iii. p. 217, 218.) In 1740, they
had increased to 146,080; and in 1765, I left them, without the
Jews 161,899. I am ignorant whether they have since continued in a
progressive state.]

[ The Père Montfaucon distributes his own observations into
twenty days; he should have styled them weeks, or months, of his visits
to the different parts of the city, (Diarium Italicum, c. 8&mdash;20, p.
104&mdash;301.) That learned Benedictine reviews the topographers of ancient
Rome; the first efforts of Blondus, Fulvius, Martianus, and Faunus, the
superior labors of Pyrrhus Ligorius, had his learning been equal to his
labors; the writings of Onuphrius Panvinius, qui omnes obscuravit, and
the recent but imperfect books of Donatus and Nardini. Yet Montfaucon
still sighs for a more complete plan and description of the old
city, which must be attained by the three following methods: 1. The
measurement of the space and intervals of the ruins. 2. The study of
inscriptions, and the places where they were found. 3. The investigation
of all the acts, charters, diaries of the middle ages, which name
any spot or building of Rome. The laborious work, such as Montfaucon
desired, must be promoted by princely or public munificence: but
the great modern plan of Nolli (A.D. 1748) would furnish a solid and
accurate basis for the ancient topography of Rome.]

Of these pilgrims, and of every reader, the attention will be excited
by a History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire; the greatest,
perhaps, and most awful scene in the history of mankind. The various
causes and progressive effects are connected with many of the events
most interesting in human annals: the artful policy of the Cæsars, who
long maintained the name and image of a free republic; the disorders of
military despotism; the rise, establishment, and sects of Christianity;
the foundation of Constantinople; the division of the monarchy; the
invasion and settlements of the Barbarians of Germany and Scythia; the
institutions of the civil law; the character and religion of Mahomet;
the temporal sovereignty of the popes; the restoration and decay of the
Western empire of Charlemagne; the crusades of the Latins in the East:
the conquests of the Saracens and Turks; the ruin of the Greek empire;
the state and revolutions of Rome in the middle age. The historian
may applaud the importance and variety of his subject; but while he is
conscious of his own imperfections, he must often accuse the deficiency
of his materials. It was among the ruins of the Capitol that I first
conceived the idea of a work which has amused and exercised near twenty
years of my life, and which, however inadequate to my own wishes, I
finally delivere to the curiosity and candor of the public.
