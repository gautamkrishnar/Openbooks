A ray of historic light seems to beam from the darkness of the tenth
century. We open with curiosity and respect the royal volumes of
Constantine Porphyrogenitus, <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> which he composed at a mature age for
the instruction of his son, and which promise to unfold the state of the
eastern empire, both in peace and war, both at home and abroad. In the
first of these works he minutely describes the pompous ceremonies of the
church and palace of Constantinople, according to his own practice, and
that of his predecessors. <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> In the second, he attempts an accurate
survey of the provinces, the themes, as they were then denominated, both
of Europe and Asia. <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> The system of Roman tactics, the discipline and
order of the troops, and the military operations by land and sea, are
explained in the third of these didactic collections, which may be
ascribed to Constantine or his father Leo. <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> In the fourth, of the
administration of the empire, he reveals the secrets of the Byzantine
policy, in friendly or hostile intercourse with the nations of the
earth. The literary labors of the age, the practical systems of law,
agriculture, and history, might redound to the benefit of the subject
and the honor of the Macedonian princes. The sixty books of the
Basilics, <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> the code and pandects of civil jurisprudence, were
gradually framed in the three first reigns of that prosperous dynasty.
The art of agriculture had amused the leisure, and exercised the pens,
of the best and wisest of the ancients; and their chosen precepts are
comprised in the twenty books of the Geoponics <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> of Constantine. At
his command, the historical examples of vice and virtue were methodized
in fifty-three books, <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> and every citizen might apply, to his
contemporaries or himself, the lesson or the warning of past times. From
the august character of a legislator, the sovereign of the East
descends to the more humble office of a teacher and a scribe; and if his
successors and subjects were regardless of his paternal cares, we may
inherit and enjoy the everlasting legacy.

elegantly defined by Claudian:&mdash;

     Et regnum cum luce dedit. 
     Cognata potestas 
     Excepit Tyrio venerabile pignus in ostro.

Ecclesiae Byzantinae, wandered from Constantinople to Buda, Frankfort,
and Leipsic, where it was published in a splendid edition by Leich and

fail to bestow on the worthy or worthless object of their toil.]

corrected from a Ms. of the royal library of Paris, which Isaac Casaubon

1745,) yet the text is still corrupt and mutilated, the version is still
obscure and faulty. The Imperial library of Vienna would afford some

books of this Greek code have been published, with a Latin version, by
Charles Annibal Frabrottus, (Paris, 1647,) in seven tomes in folio;
iv. other books have been since discovered, and are inserted in Gerard
Meerman's Novus Thesaurus Juris Civ. et Canon. tom. v. Of the whole

preface, that the same emperor restored the long-forgotten systems
of rhetoric and philosophy; and his two books of Hippiatrica, or
Horse-physic, were published at Paris, 1530, in folio, (Fabric. Bibliot.

Vitiis, (by Henry Valesius, or de Valois, Paris, 1634.)]

A closer survey will indeed reduce the value of the gift, and the
gratitude of posterity: in the possession of these Imperial treasures we
may still deplore our poverty and ignorance; and the fading glories
of their authors will be obliterated by indifference or contempt. The
Basilics will sink to a broken copy, a partial and mutilated version, in
the Greek language, of the laws of Justinian; but the sense of the
old civilians is often superseded by the influence of bigotry: and the
absolute prohibition of divorce, concubinage, and interest for money,
enslaves the freedom of trade and the happiness of private life. In the
historical book, a subject of Constantine might admire the inimitable
virtues of Greece and Rome: he might learn to what a pitch of energy
and elevation the human character had formerly aspired. But a contrary
effect must have been produced by a new edition of the lives of the
saints, which the great logothete, or chancellor of the empire, was
directed to prepare; and the dark fund of superstition was enriched by
the fabulous and florid legends of Simon the Metaphrast. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> The merits
and miracles of the whole calendar are of less account in the eyes of a
sage, than the toil of a single husbandman, who multiplies the gifts
of the Creator, and supplies the food of his brethren. Yet the royal
authors of the Geoponics were more seriously employed in expounding the
precepts of the destroying art, which had been taught since the days of
Xenophon, <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> as the art of heroes and kings. But the Tactics of Leo and
Constantine are mingled with the baser alloy of the age in which they
lived. It was destitute of original genius; they implicitly transcribe
the rules and maxims which had been confirmed by victories. It was
unskilled in the propriety of style and method; they blindly confound
the most distant and discordant institutions, the phalanx of Sparta
and that of Macedon, the legions of Cato and Trajan, of Augustus and
Theodosius. Even the use, or at least the importance, of these military
rudiments may be fairly questioned: their general theory is dictated
by reason; but the merit, as well as difficulty, consists in the
application. The discipline of a soldier is formed by exercise rather
than by study: the talents of a commander are appropriated to those
calm, though rapid, minds, which nature produces to decide the fate of
armies and nations: the former is the habit of a life, the latter the
glance of a moment; and the battles won by lessons of tactics may be
numbered with the epic poems created from the rules of criticism.
The book of ceremonies is a recital, tedious yet imperfect, of the
despicable pageantry which had infected the church and state since the
gradual decay of the purity of the one and the power of the other.
A review of the themes or provinces might promise such authentic and
useful information, as the curiosity of government only can obtain,
instead of traditionary fables on the origin of the cities, and
malicious epigrams on the vices of their inhabitants. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> Such
information the historian would have been pleased to record; nor should
his silence be condemned if the most interesting objects, the population
of the capital and provinces, the amount of the taxes and revenues,
the numbers of subjects and strangers who served under the Imperial
standard, have been unnoticed by Leo the philosopher, and his son
Constantine. His treatise of the public administration is stained with
the same blemishes; yet it is discriminated by peculiar merit; the
antiquities of the nations may be doubtful or fabulous; but the
geography and manners of the Barbaric world are delineated with curious
accuracy. Of these nations, the Franks alone were qualified to observe
in their turn, and to describe, the metropolis of the East. The
ambassador of the great Otho, a bishop of Cremona, has painted the state
of Constantinople about the middle of the tenth century: his style
is glowing, his narrative lively, his observation keen; and even the
prejudices and passions of Liutprand are stamped with an original
character of freedom and genius. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> From this scanty fund of foreign
and domestic materials, I shall investigate the form and substance of
the Byzantine empire; the provinces and wealth, the civil government and
military force, the character and literature, of the Greeks in a period
of six hundred years, from the reign of Heraclius to his successful
invasion of the Franks or Latins.

[ The life and writings of Simon Metaphrastes are described
by Hankius, (de Scriptoribus Byzant. p. 418-460.) This biographer
of the saints indulged himself in a loose paraphrase of the sense or
nonsense of more ancient acts. His Greek rhetoric is again paraphrased
in the Latin version of Surius, and scarcely a thread can be now visible
of the original texture.]

[ According to the first book of the Cyropaedia, professors
of tactics, a small part of the science of war, were already instituted
in Persia, by which Greece must be understood. A good edition of all the
Scriptores Tactici would be a task not unworthy of a scholar. His
industry might discover some new Mss., and his learning might illustrate
the military history of the ancients. But this scholar should be
likewise a soldier; and alas! Quintus Icilius is no more. * Note: M.

[ After observing that the demerit of the Cappadocians
rose in proportion to their rank and riches, he inserts a more pointed
epigram, which is ascribed to Demodocus. The sting is precisely the same
with the French epigram against Freron: Un serpent mordit Jean
Freron&mdash;Eh bien? Le serpent en mourut. But as the Paris wits are seldom
read in the Anthology, I should be curious to learn, through what
channel it was conveyed for their imitation, (Constantin. Porphyrogen.
de Themat. c. ii. Brunck Analect. Graec. tom. ii. p. 56. Brodaei

After the final division between the sons of Theodosius, the swarms
of Barbarians from Scythia and Germany over-spread the provinces and
extinguished the empire of ancient Rome. The weakness of Constantinople
was concealed by extent of dominion: her limits were inviolate, or at
least entire; and the kingdom of Justinian was enlarged by the splendid
acquisition of Africa and Italy. But the possession of these new
conquests was transient and precarious; and almost a moiety of the
Eastern empire was torn away by the arms of the Saracens. Syria and
Egypt were oppressed by the Arabian caliphs; and, after the reduction of
Africa, their lieutenants invaded and subdued the Roman province which
had been changed into the Gothic monarchy of Spain. The islands of the
Mediterranean were not inaccessible to their naval powers; and it was
from their extreme stations, the harbors of Crete and the fortresses of
Cilicia, that the faithful or rebel emirs insulted the majesty of the
throne and capital. The remaining provinces, under the obedience of
the emperors, were cast into a new mould; and the jurisdiction of
the presidents, the consulars, and the counts were superseded by the
institution of the themes, <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> or military governments, which prevailed
under the successors of Heraclius, and are described by the pen of the
royal author. Of the twenty-nine themes, twelve in Europe and seventeen
in Asia, the origin is obscure, the etymology doubtful or capricious:
the limits were arbitrary and fluctuating; but some particular names,
that sound the most strangely to our ear, were derived from the
character and attributes of the troops that were maintained at the
expense, and for the guard, of the respective divisions. The vanity of
the Greek princes most eagerly grasped the shadow of conquest and the
memory of lost dominion. A new Mesopotamia was created on the western
side of the Euphrates: the appellation and praetor of Sicily were
transferred to a narrow slip of Calabria; and a fragment of the duchy of
Beneventum was promoted to the style and title of the theme of Lombardy.
In the decline of the Arabian empire, the successors of Constantine
might indulge their pride in more solid advantages. The victories of
Nicephorus, John Zimisces, and Basil the Second, revived the fame, and
enlarged the boundaries, of the Roman name: the province of Cilicia, the
metropolis of Antioch, the islands of Crete and Cyprus, were restored to
the allegiance of Christ and Caesar: one third of Italy was annexed to
the throne of Constantinople: the kingdom of Bulgaria was destroyed; and
the last sovereigns of the Macedonian dynasty extended their sway from
the sources of the Tigris to the neighborhood of Rome. In the eleventh
century, the prospect was again clouded by new enemies and new
misfortunes: the relics of Italy were swept away by the Norman
adventures; and almost all the Asiatic branches were dissevered from the
Roman trunk by the Turkish conquerors. After these losses, the
emperors of the Comnenian family continued to reign from the Danube
to Peloponnesus, and from Belgrade to Nice, Trebizond, and the winding
stream of the Meander. The spacious provinces of Thrace, Macedonia,
and Greece, were obedient to their sceptre; the possession of Cyprus,
Rhodes, and Crete, was accompanied by the fifty islands of the Aegean or
Holy Sea; <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> and the remnant of their empire transcends the measure of
the largest of the European kingdoms.

names of Archipelago, l'Archipel, and the Arches, have been transformed
by geographers and seamen, (D'Anville, Geographie Ancienne, tom. i. p.
281. Analyse de la Carte de la Greece, p. 60.) The numbers of monks
or caloyers in all the islands and the adjacent mountain of Athos,
(Observations de Belon, fol. 32, verso,) monte santo, might justify the
epithet of holy, a slight alteration from the original, imposed by the
Dorians, who, in their dialect, gave the figurative name of goats, to
the bounding waves, (Vossius, apud Cellarium, Geograph. Antiq. tom. i.
p. 829.)]
</p>
<p>
The same princes might assert, with dignity and truth, that of all the
monarchs of Christendom they possessed the greatest city, <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> the most
ample revenue, the most flourishing and populous state. With the decline
and fall of the empire, the cities of the West had decayed and fallen;
nor could the ruins of Rome, or the mud walls, wooden hovels, and narrow
precincts of Paris and London, prepare the Latin stranger to contemplate
the situation and extent of Constantinople, her stately palaces
and churches, and the arts and luxury of an innumerable people. Her
treasures might attract, but her virgin strength had repelled, and still
promised to repel, the audacious invasion of the Persian and Bulgarian,
the Arab and the Russian. The provinces were less fortunate and
impregnable; and few districts, few cities, could be discovered which
had not been violated by some fierce Barbarian, impatient to despoil,
because he was hopeless to possess. From the age of Justinian the
Eastern empire was sinking below its former level; the powers of
destruction were more active than those of improvement; and the
calamities of war were imbittered by the more permanent evils of
civil and ecclesiastical tyranny. The captive who had escaped from the
Barbarians was often stripped and imprisoned by the ministers of his
sovereign: the Greek superstition relaxed the mind by prayer, and
emaciated the body by fasting; and the multitude of convents and
festivals diverted many hands and many days from the temporal service
of mankind. Yet the subjects of the Byzantine empire were still the most
dexterous and diligent of nations; their country was blessed by nature
with every advantage of soil, climate, and situation; and, in the
support and restoration of the arts, their patient and peaceful temper
was more useful than the warlike spirit and feudal anarchy of Europe.
The provinces that still adhered to the empire were repeopled and
enriched by the misfortunes of those which were irrecoverably lost.
From the yoke of the caliphs, the Catholics of Syria, Egypt, and Africa
retired to the allegiance of their prince, to the society of their
brethren: the movable wealth, which eludes the search of oppression,
accompanied and alleviated their exile, and Constantinople received
into her bosom the fugitive trade of Alexandria and Tyre. The chiefs
of Armenia and Scythia, who fled from hostile or religious persecution,
were hospitably entertained: their followers were encouraged to build
new cities and to cultivate waste lands; and many spots, both in Europe
and Asia, preserved the name, the manners, or at least the memory, of
these national colonies. Even the tribes of Barbarians, who had seated
themselves in arms on the territory of the empire, were gradually
reclaimed to the laws of the church and state; and as long as they were
separated from the Greeks, their posterity supplied a race of faithful
and obedient soldiers. Did we possess sufficient materials to survey
the twenty-nine themes of the Byzantine monarchy, our curiosity might
be satisfied with a chosen example: it is fortunate enough that the
clearest light should be thrown on the most interesting province,
and the name of Peloponnesus will awaken the attention of the classic
reader.

[ According to the Jewish traveller who had visited Europe
and Asia, Constantinople was equalled only by Bagdad, the great city of
the Ismaelites, (Voyage de Benjamin de Tudele, par Baratier, tom. l. c.
v. p. 46.)]
</p>
<p>
As early as the eighth century, in the troubled reign of the
Iconoclasts, Greece, and even Peloponnesus, <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> were overrun by some
Sclavonian bands who outstripped the royal standard of Bulgaria. The
strangers of old, Cadmus, and Danaus, and Pelops, had planted in that
fruitful soil the seeds of policy and learning; but the savages of the
north eradicated what yet remained of their sickly and withered roots.
In this irruption, the country and the inhabitants were transformed; the
Grecian blood was contaminated; and the proudest nobles of Peloponnesus
were branded with the names of foreigners and slaves. By the diligence
of succeeding princes, the land was in some measure purified from the
Barbarians; and the humble remnant was bound by an oath of obedience,
tribute, and military service, which they often renewed and often
violated. The siege of Patras was formed by a singular concurrence of
the Sclavonians of Peloponnesus and the Saracens of Africa. In their
last distress, a pious fiction of the approach of the praetor of
Corinth revived the courage of the citizens. Their sally was bold and
successful; the strangers embarked, the rebels submitted, and the glory
of the day was ascribed to a phantom or a stranger, who fought in the
foremost ranks under the character of St. Andrew the Apostle. The shrine
which contained his relics was decorated with the trophies of victory,
and the captive race was forever devoted to the service and vassalage
of the metropolitan church of Patras. By the revolt of two Sclavonian
tribes, in the neighborhood of Helos and Lacedaemon, the peace of the
peninsula was often disturbed. They sometimes insulted the weakness, and
sometimes resisted the oppression, of the Byzantine government, till at
length the approach of their hostile brethren extorted a golden bull
to define the rites and obligations of the Ezzerites and Milengi, whose
annual tribute was defined at twelve hundred pieces of gold. From
these strangers the Imperial geographer has accurately distinguished a
domestic, and perhaps original, race, who, in some degree, might derive
their blood from the much-injured Helots. The liberality of the Romans,
and especially of Augustus, had enfranchised the maritime cities from
the dominion of Sparta; and the continuance of the same benefit ennobled
them with the title of Eleuthero, or Free-Laconians. <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> In the time
of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, they had acquired the name of Mainotes,
under which they dishonor the claim of liberty by the inhuman pillage of
all that is shipwrecked on their rocky shores. Their territory, barren
of corn, but fruitful of olives, extended to the Cape of Malea: they
accepted a chief or prince from the Byzantine praetor, and a light
tribute of four hundred pieces of gold was the badge of their immunity,
rather than of their dependence. The freemen of Laconia assumed the
character of Romans, and long adhered to the religion of the Greeks.
By the zeal of the emperor Basil, they were baptized in the faith of
Christ: but the altars of Venus and Neptune had been crowned by these
rustic votaries five hundred years after they were proscribed in the
Roman world. In the theme of Peloponnesus, <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> forty cities were still
numbered, and the declining state of Sparta, Argos, and Corinth, may be
suspended in the tenth century, at an equal distance, perhaps, between
their antique splendor and their present desolation. The duty of
military service, either in person or by substitute, was imposed on the
lands or benefices of the province; a sum of five pieces of gold was
assessed on each of the substantial tenants; and the same capitation was
shared among several heads of inferior value. On the proclamation of
an Italian war, the Peloponnesians excused themselves by a voluntary
oblation of one hundred pounds of gold, (four thousand pounds sterling,)
and a thousand horses with their arms and trappings. The churches
and monasteries furnished their contingent; a sacrilegious profit was
extorted from the sale of ecclesiastical honors; and the indigent bishop
of Leucadia <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> was made responsible for a pension of one hundred
pieces of gold. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a>

But the wealth of the province, and the trust of the revenue, were
founded on the fair and plentiful produce of trade and manufacturers;
and some symptoms of liberal policy may be traced in a law which exempts
from all personal taxes the mariners of Peloponnesus, and the workmen
in parchment and purple. This denomination may be fairly applied or
extended to the manufacturers of linen, woollen, and more especially of
silk: the two former of which had flourished in Greece since the days
of Homer; and the last was introduced perhaps as early as the reign
of Justinian. These arts, which were exercised at Corinth, Thebes,
and Argos, afforded food and occupation to a numerous people: the
men, women, and children were distributed according to their age and
strength; and, if many of these were domestic slaves, their masters, who
directed the work and enjoyed the profit, were of a free and honorable
condition. The gifts which a rich and generous matron of Peloponnesus
presented to the emperor Basil, her adopted son, were doubtless
fabricated in the Grecian looms. Danielis bestowed a carpet of fine
wool, of a pattern which imitated the spots of a peacock's tail, of a
magnitude to overspread the floor of a new church, erected in the triple
name of Christ, of Michael the archangel, and of the prophet Elijah.
She gave six hundred pieces of silk and linen, of various use and
denomination: the silk was painted with the Tyrian dye, and adorned by
the labors of the needle; and the linen was so exquisitely fine, that
an entire piece might be rolled in the hollow of a cane. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> In
his description of the Greek manufactures, an historian of Sicily
discriminates their price, according to the weight and quality of the
silk, the closeness of the texture, the beauty of the colors, and the
taste and materials of the embroidery. A single, or even a double or
treble thread was thought sufficient for ordinary sale; but the union
of six threads composed a piece of stronger and more costly workmanship.
Among the colors, he celebrates, with affectation of eloquence, the
fiery blaze of the scarlet, and the softer lustre of the green. The
embroidery was raised either in silk or gold: the more simple ornament
of stripes or circles was surpassed by the nicer imitation of flowers:
the vestments that were fabricated for the palace or the altar often
glittered with precious stones; and the figures were delineated in
strings of Oriental pearls. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> Till the twelfth century, Greece alone,
of all the countries of Christendom, was possessed of the insect who
is taught by nature, and of the workmen who are instructed by art,
to prepare this elegant luxury. But the secret had been stolen by the
dexterity and diligence of the Arabs: the caliphs of the East and West
scorned to borrow from the unbelievers their furniture and apparel;
and two cities of Spain, Almeria and Lisbon, were famous for the
manufacture, the use, and, perhaps, the exportation, of silk. It was
first introduced into Sicily by the Normans; and this emigration of
trade distinguishes the victory of Roger from the uniform and fruitless
hostilities of every age. After the sack of Corinth, Athens, and Thebes,
his lieutenant embarked with a captive train of weavers and artificers
of both sexes, a trophy glorious to their master, and disgraceful to the
Greek emperor. <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> The king of Sicily was not insensible of the value
of the present; and, in the restitution of the prisoners, he excepted
only the male and female manufacturers of Thebes and Corinth, who labor,
says the Byzantine historian, under a barbarous lord, like the old
Eretrians in the service of Darius. <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> A stately edifice, in the
palace of Palermo, was erected for the use of this industrious colony;
<a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> and the art was propagated by their children and disciples to
satisfy the increasing demand of the western world. The decay of the
looms of Sicily may be ascribed to the troubles of the island, and the
competition of the Italian cities. In the year thirteen hundred and
fourteen, Lucca alone, among her sister republics, enjoyed the lucrative
monopoly. <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> A domestic revolution dispersed the manufacturers to
Florence, Bologna, Venice, Milan, and even the countries beyond the
Alps; and thirteen years after this event the statutes of Modena enjoin
the planting of mulberry-trees, and regulate the duties on raw silk.
<a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> The northern climates are less propitious to the education of the
silkworm; but the industry of France and England <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> is supplied and

<h2>
    Chapter LIII: Fate Of The Eastern Empire.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
I must repeat the complaint that the vague and scanty memorials of the
times will not afford any just estimate of the taxes, the revenue, and
the resources of the Greek empire. From every province of Europe and
Asia the rivulets of gold and silver discharged into the Imperial
reservoir a copious and perennial stream. The separation of the branches
from the trunk increased the relative magnitude of Constantinople; and
the maxims of despotism contracted the state to the capital, the capital
to the palace, and the palace to the royal person. A Jewish traveller,
who visited the East in the twelfth century, is lost in his admiration
of the Byzantine riches. "It is here," says Benjamin of Tudela, "in
the queen of cities, that the tributes of the Greek empire are annually
deposited and the lofty towers are filled with precious magazines of
silk, purple, and gold. It is said, that Constantinople pays each day
to her sovereign twenty thousand pieces of gold; which are levied on the
shops, taverns, and markets, on the merchants of Persia and Egypt, of
Russia and Hungary, of Italy and Spain, who frequent the capital by
sea and land." <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> In all pecuniary matters, the authority of a Jew
is doubtless respectable; but as the three hundred and sixty-five days
would produce a yearly income exceeding seven millions sterling, I
am tempted to retrench at least the numerous festivals of the Greek
calendar. The mass of treasure that was saved by Theodora and Basil
the Second will suggest a splendid, though indefinite, idea of their
supplies and resources. The mother of Michael, before she retired to a
cloister, attempted to check or expose the prodigality of her ungrateful
son, by a free and faithful account of the wealth which he inherited;
one hundred and nine thousand pounds of gold, and three hundred thousand
of silver, the fruits of her own economy and that of her deceased
husband. <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> The avarice of Basil is not less renowned than his valor
and fortune: his victorious armies were paid and rewarded without
breaking into the mass of two hundred thousand pounds of gold, (about
eight millions sterling,) which he had buried in the subterraneous
vaults of the palace. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> Such accumulation of treasure is rejected by
the theory and practice of modern policy; and we are more apt to compute
the national riches by the use and abuse of the public credit. Yet the
maxims of antiquity are still embraced by a monarch formidable to his
enemies; by a republic respectable to her allies; and both have attained
their respective ends of military power and domestic tranquillity.

<p>
Whatever might be consumed for the present wants, or reserved for the
future use, of the state, the first and most sacred demand was for the
pomp and pleasure of the emperor, and his discretion only could define
the measure of his private expense. The princes of Constantinople were
far removed from the simplicity of nature; yet, with the revolving
seasons, they were led by taste or fashion to withdraw to a purer air,
from the smoke and tumult of the capital. They enjoyed, or affected to
enjoy, the rustic festival of the vintage: their leisure was amused by
the exercise of the chase and the calmer occupation of fishing, and in
the summer heats, they were shaded from the sun, and refreshed by the
cooling breezes from the sea. The coasts and islands of Asia and Europe
were covered with their magnificent villas; but, instead of the modest
art which secretly strives to hide itself and to decorate the scenery of
nature, the marble structure of their gardens served only to expose
the riches of the lord, and the labors of the architect. The successive
casualties of inheritance and forfeiture had rendered the sovereign
proprietor of many stately houses in the city and suburbs, of which
twelve were appropriated to the ministers of state; but the great
palace, <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> the centre of the Imperial residence, was fixed during
eleven centuries to the same position, between the hippodrome, the
cathedral of St. Sophia, and the gardens, which descended by many a
terrace to the shores of the Propontis. The primitive edifice of the
first Constantine was a copy, or rival, of ancient Rome; the gradual
improvements of his successors aspired to emulate the wonders of the old
world, <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> and in the tenth century, the Byzantine palace excited the
admiration, at least of the Latins, by an unquestionable preeminence of
strength, size, and magnificence. <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> But the toil and treasure of so
many ages had produced a vast and irregular pile: each separate building
was marked with the character of the times and of the founder; and the
want of space might excuse the reigning monarch, who demolished, perhaps
with secret satisfaction, the works of his predecessors. The economy
of the emperor Theophilus allowed a more free and ample scope for his
domestic luxury and splendor. A favorite ambassador, who had astonished
the Abbassides themselves by his pride and liberality, presented on his
return the model of a palace, which the caliph of Bagdad had recently
constructed on the banks of the Tigris. The model was instantly copied
and surpassed: the new buildings of Theophilus <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> were accompanied
with gardens, and with five churches, one of which was conspicuous for
size and beauty: it was crowned with three domes, the roof of gilt brass
reposed on columns of Italian marble, and the walls were incrusted with
marbles of various colors. In the face of the church, a semicircular
portico, of the figure and name of the Greek sigma, was supported by
fifteen columns of Phrygian marble, and the subterraneous vaults were of
a similar construction. The square before the sigma was decorated with
a fountain, and the margin of the basin was lined and encompassed with
plates of silver. In the beginning of each season, the basin, instead
of water, was replenished with the most exquisite fruits, which were
abandoned to the populace for the entertainment of the prince. He
enjoyed this tumultuous spectacle from a throne resplendent with gold
and gems, which was raised by a marble staircase to the height of a
lofty terrace. Below the throne were seated the officers of his guards,
the magistrates, the chiefs of the factions of the circus; the inferior
steps were occupied by the people, and the place below was covered with
troops of dancers, singers, and pantomimes. The square was surrounded
by the hall of justice, the arsenal, and the various offices of
business and pleasure; and the purple chamber was named from the annual
distribution of robes of scarlet and purple by the hand of the empress
herself. The long series of the apartments was adapted to the seasons,
and decorated with marble and porphyry, with painting, sculpture, and
mosaics, with a profusion of gold, silver, and precious stones. His
fanciful magnificence employed the skill and patience of such artists
as the times could afford: but the taste of Athens would have despised
their frivolous and costly labors; a golden tree, with its leaves and
branches, which sheltered a multitude of birds warbling their artificial
notes, and two lions of massy gold, and of natural size, who looked and
roared like their brethren of the forest. The successors of Theophilus,
of the Basilian and Comnenian dynasties, were not less ambitious of
leaving some memorial of their residence; and the portion of the palace
most splendid and august was dignified with the title of the golden
triclinium. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> With becoming modesty, the rich and noble Greeks
aspired to imitate their sovereign, and when they passed through the
streets on horseback, in their robes of silk and embroidery, they were
mistaken by the children for kings. <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> A matron of Peloponnesus,
<a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> who had cherished the infant fortunes of Basil the Macedonian, was
excited by tenderness or vanity to visit the greatness of her adopted
son. In a journey of five hundred miles from Patras to Constantinople,
her age or indolence declined the fatigue of a horse or carriage: the
soft litter or bed of Danielis was transported on the shoulders of ten
robust slaves; and as they were relieved at easy distances, a band of
three hundred were selected for the performance of this service. She
was entertained in the Byzantine palace with filial reverence, and the
honors of a queen; and whatever might be the origin of her wealth, her
gifts were not unworthy of the regal dignity. I have already described
the fine and curious manufactures of Peloponnesus, of linen, silk, and
woollen; but the most acceptable of her presents consisted in three
hundred beautiful youths, of whom one hundred were eunuchs; <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> "for
she was not ignorant," says the historian, "that the air of the palace
is more congenial to such insects, than a shepherd's dairy to the flies
of the summer." During her lifetime, she bestowed the greater part of
her estates in Peloponnesus, and her testament instituted Leo, the
son of Basil, her universal heir. After the payment of the legacies,
fourscore villas or farms were added to the Imperial domain; and three
thousand slaves of Danielis were enfranchised by their new lord, and
transplanted as a colony to the Italian coast. From this example of
a private matron, we may estimate the wealth and magnificence of the
emperors. Yet our enjoyments are confined by a narrow circle; and,
whatsoever may be its value, the luxury of life is possessed with more
innocence and safety by the master of his own, than by the steward of
the public, fortune.

<p>
In an absolute government, which levels the distinctions of noble and
plebeian birth, the sovereign is the sole fountain of honor; and the
rank, both in the palace and the empire, depends on the titles and
offices which are bestowed and resumed by his arbitrary will. Above a
thousand years, from Vespasian to Alexius Comnenus, <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> the Caesar
was the second person, or at least the second degree, after the supreme
title of Augustus was more freely communicated to the sons and brothers
of the reigning monarch. To elude without violating his promise to
a powerful associate, the husband of his sister, and, without giving
himself an equal, to reward the piety of his brother Isaac, the crafty
Alexius interposed a new and supereminent dignity. The happy flexibility
of the Greek tongue allowed him to compound the names of Augustus and
Emperor (Sebastos and Autocrator,) and the union produces the sonorous
title of Sebastocrator. He was exalted above the Caesar on the first
step of the throne: the public acclamations repeated his name; and he
was only distinguished from the sovereign by some peculiar ornaments
of the head and feet. The emperor alone could assume the purple or red
buskins, and the close diadem or tiara, which imitated the fashion of
the Persian kings. <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> It was a high pyramidal cap of cloth or silk,
almost concealed by a profusion of pearls and jewels: the crown was
formed by a horizontal circle and two arches of gold: at the summit,
the point of their intersection, was placed a globe or cross, and two
strings or lappets of pearl depended on either cheek. Instead of red,
the buskins of the Sebastocrator and Caesar were green; and on
their open coronets or crowns, the precious gems were more sparingly
distributed. Beside and below the Caesar the fancy of Alexius
created the Panhypersebastos and the Protosebastos, whose sound and
signification will satisfy a Grecian ear. They imply a superiority and
a priority above the simple name of Augustus; and this sacred and
primitive title of the Roman prince was degraded to the kinsmen and
servants of the Byzantine court. The daughter of Alexius applauds, with
fond complacency, this artful gradation of hopes and honors; but the
science of words is accessible to the meanest capacity; and this vain
dictionary was easily enriched by the pride of his successors. To their
favorite sons or brothers, they imparted the more lofty appellation
of Lord or Despot, which was illustrated with new ornaments, and

himself. The five titles of, 1. Despot; 2. Sebastocrator; 3. Caesar; 4.
Panhypersebastos; and, 5. Protosebastos; were usually confined to the
princes of his blood: they were the emanations of his majesty; but as
they exercised no regular functions, their existence was useless, and
their authority precarious.

But in every monarchy the substantial powers of government must be
divided and exercised by the ministers of the palace and treasury, the
fleet and army. The titles alone can differ; and in the revolution of
ages, the counts and praefects, the praetor and quaestor, insensibly
descended, while their servants rose above their heads to the first
honors of the state. 1. In a monarchy, which refers every object to the
person of the prince, the care and ceremonies of the palace form the
most respectable department. The Curopalata, <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> so illustrious in the
age of Justinian, was supplanted by the Protovestiare, whose primitive
functions were limited to the custody of the wardrobe. From thence his
jurisdiction was extended over the numerous menials of pomp and luxury;
and he presided with his silver wand at the public and private audience.
2. In the ancient system of Constantine, the name of Logothete, or
accountant, was applied to the receivers of the finances: the principal
officers were distinguished as the Logothetes of the domain, of
the posts, the army, the private and public treasure; and the great
Logothete, the supreme guardian of the laws and revenues, is compared
with the chancellor of the Latin monarchies. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> His discerning
eye pervaded the civil administration; and he was assisted, in due
subordination, by the eparch or praefect of the city, the first
secretary, and the keepers of the privy seal, the archives, and the red
or purple ink which was reserved for the sacred signature of the emperor
alone. <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> The introductor and interpreter of foreign ambassadors
were the great Chiauss <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> and the Dragoman, <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> two names of Turkish
origin, and which are still familiar to the Sublime Porte. 3. From the
humble style and service of guards, the Domestics insensibly rose to
the station of generals; the military themes of the East and West, the
legions of Europe and Asia, were often divided, till the great Domestic
was finally invested with the universal and absolute command of the land
forces. The Protostrator, in his original functions, was the assistant
of the emperor when he mounted on horseback: he gradually became the
lieutenant of the great Domestic in the field; and his jurisdiction
extended over the stables, the cavalry, and the royal train of hunting
and hawking. The Stratopedarch was the great judge of the camp: the
Protospathaire commanded the guards; the Constable, <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> the great
Aeteriarch, and the Acolyth, were the separate chiefs of the Franks, the
Barbarians, and the Varangi, or English, the mercenary strangers, who,
a the decay of the national spirit, formed the nerve of the Byzantine
armies. 4. The naval powers were under the command of the great Duke;
in his absence they obeyed the great Drungaire of the fleet; and, in
his place, the Emir, or Admiral, a name of Saracen extraction, <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> but
which has been naturalized in all the modern languages of Europe. Of
these officers, and of many more whom it would be useless to enumerate,
the civil and military hierarchy was framed. Their honors and
emoluments, their dress and titles, their mutual salutations and
respective preeminence, were balanced with more exquisite labor than
would have fixed the constitution of a free people; and the code was
almost perfect when this baseless fabric, the monument of pride and
servitude, was forever buried in the ruins of the empire. <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter LIII: Fate Of The Eastern Empire.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
The most lofty titles, and the most humble postures, which devotion has
applied to the Supreme Being, have been prostituted by flattery and fear
to creatures of the same nature with ourselves. The mode of adoration,
<a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> of falling prostrate on the ground, and kissing the feet of the
emperor, was borrowed by Diocletian from Persian servitude; but it
was continued and aggravated till the last age of the Greek monarchy.
Excepting only on Sundays, when it was waived, from a motive of
religious pride, this humiliating reverence was exacted from all who
entered the royal presence, from the princes invested with the diadem
and purple, and from the ambassadors who represented their independent
sovereigns, the caliphs of Asia, Egypt, or Spain, the kings of France
and Italy, and the Latin emperors of ancient Rome. In his transactions
of business, Liutprand, bishop of Cremona, <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> asserted the free spirit
of a Frank and the dignity of his master Otho. Yet his sincerity cannot
disguise the abasement of his first audience. When he approached the
throne, the birds of the golden tree began to warble their notes, which
were accompanied by the roarings of the two lions of gold. With his two
companions Liutprand was compelled to bow and to fall prostrate; and
thrice to touch the ground with his forehead. He arose, but in the short
interval, the throne had been hoisted from the floor to the ceiling,
the Imperial figure appeared in new and more gorgeous apparel, and the
interview was concluded in haughty and majestic silence. In this honest
and curious narrative, the Bishop of Cremona represents the ceremonies
of the Byzantine court, which are still practised in the Sublime Porte,
and which were preserved in the last age by the dukes of Muscovy
or Russia. After a long journey by sea and land, from Venice to
Constantinople, the ambassador halted at the golden gate, till he was
conducted by the formal officers to the hospitable palace prepared for
his reception; but this palace was a prison, and his jealous keepers
prohibited all social intercourse either with strangers or natives.
At his first audience, he offered the gifts of his master, slaves, and
golden vases, and costly armor. The ostentatious payment of the officers
and troops displayed before his eyes the riches of the empire: he was
entertained at a royal banquet, <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> in which the ambassadors of the
nations were marshalled by the esteem or contempt of the Greeks: from
his own table, the emperor, as the most signal favor, sent the plates
which he had tasted; and his favorites were dismissed with a robe
of honor. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> In the morning and evening of each day, his civil and
military servants attended their duty in the palace; their labors were
repaid by the sight, perhaps by the smile, of their lord; his commands
were signified by a nod or a sign: but all earthly greatness stood
silent and submissive in his presence. In his regular or extraordinary
processions through the capital, he unveiled his person to the public
view: the rites of policy were connected with those of religion, and his
visits to the principal churches were regulated by the festivals of the
Greek calendar. On the eve of these processions, the gracious or devout
intention of the monarch was proclaimed by the heralds. The streets were
cleared and purified; the pavement was strewed with flowers; the most
precious furniture, the gold and silver plate, and silken hangings,
were displayed from the windows and balconies, and a severe discipline
restrained and silenced the tumult of the populace. The march was opened
by the military officers at the head of their troops: they were followed
in long order by the magistrates and ministers of the civil government:
the person of the emperor was guarded by his eunuchs and domestics, and
at the church door he was solemnly received by the patriarch and
his clergy. The task of applause was not abandoned to the rude and
spontaneous voices of the crowd. The most convenient stations were
occupied by the bands of the blue and green factions of the circus; and
their furious conflicts, which had shaken the capital, were insensibly
sunk to an emulation of servitude. From either side they echoed in
responsive melody the praises of the emperor; their poets and musicians
directed the choir, and long life <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> and victory were the burden of
every song. The same acclamations were performed at the audience, the
banquet, and the church; and as an evidence of boundless sway, they were
repeated in the Latin, <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> Gothic, Persian, French, and even English
language, <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> by the mercenaries who sustained the real or fictitious
character of those nations. By the pen of Constantine Porphyrogenitus,
this science of form and flattery has been reduced into a pompous and
trifling volume, <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> which the vanity of succeeding times might enrich
with an ample supplement. Yet the calmer reflection of a prince
would surely suggest that the same acclamations were applied to every
character and every reign: and if he had risen from a private rank, he
might remember, that his own voice had been the loudest and most eager
in applause, at the very moment when he envied the fortune, or conspired
against the life, of his predecessor. <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a>

[ Et privato Othoni et nuper eadem dicenti nota adulatio,
(Tacit. Hist. 1,85.)]
</p>
<p>
The princes of the North, of the nations, says Constantine, without
faith or fame, were ambitious of mingling their blood with the blood of
the Caesars, by their marriage with a royal virgin, or by the nuptials
of their daughters with a Roman prince. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> The aged monarch, in his
instructions to his son, reveals the secret maxims of policy and pride;
and suggests the most decent reasons for refusing these insolent and
unreasonable demands. Every animal, says the discreet emperor, is
prompted by the distinction of language, religion, and manners. A just
regard to the purity of descent preserves the harmony of public and
private life; but the mixture of foreign blood is the fruitful source of
disorder and discord. Such had ever been the opinion and practice of the
sage Romans: their jurisprudence proscribed the marriage of a citizen
and a stranger: in the days of freedom and virtue, a senator would have
scorned to match his daughter with a king: the glory of Mark Antony was
sullied by an Egyptian wife: <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> and the emperor Titus was compelled,
by popular censure, to dismiss with reluctance the reluctant Berenice.
<a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> This perpetual interdict was ratified by the fabulous sanction of
the great Constantine. The ambassadors of the nations, more especially
of the unbelieving nations, were solemnly admonished, that such strange
alliances had been condemned by the founder of the church and city.
The irrevocable law was inscribed on the altar of St. Sophia; and the
impious prince who should stain the majesty of the purple was excluded
from the civil and ecclesiastical communion of the Romans. If the
ambassadors were instructed by any false brethren in the Byzantine
history, they might produce three memorable examples of the violation
of this imaginary law: the marriage of Leo, or rather of his father
Constantine the Fourth, with the daughter of the king of the Chozars,
the nuptials of the granddaughter of Romanus with a Bulgarian prince,
and the union of Bertha of France or Italy with young Romanus, the
son of Constantine Porphyrogenitus himself. To these objections three
answers were prepared, which solved the difficulty and established the
law. I.
</p>
<p>
The deed and the guilt of Constantine Copronymus were acknowledged.
The Isaurian heretic, who sullied the baptismal font, and declared war
against the holy images, had indeed embraced a Barbarian wife. By this
impious alliance he accomplished the measure of his crimes, and was
devoted to the just censure of the church and of posterity. II. Romanus
could not be alleged as a legitimate emperor; he was a plebeian usurper,
ignorant of the laws, and regardless of the honor, of the monarchy. His
son Christopher, the father of the bride, was the third in rank in
the college of princes, at once the subject and the accomplice of a
rebellious parent. The Bulgarians were sincere and devout Christians;
and the safety of the empire, with the redemption of many thousand
captives, depended on this preposterous alliance. Yet no consideration
could dispense from the law of Constantine: the clergy, the senate, and
the people, disapproved the conduct of Romanus; and he was reproached,
both in his life and death, as the author of the public disgrace. III.
For the marriage of his own son with the daughter of Hugo, king
of Italy, a more honorable defence is contrived by the wise
Porphyrogenitus. Constantine, the great and holy, esteemed the fidelity
and valor of the Franks; <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> and his prophetic spirit beheld the vision
of their future greatness. They alone were excepted from the general
prohibition: Hugo, king of France, was the lineal descendant of
Charlemagne; <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> and his daughter Bertha inherited the prerogatives of
her family and nation. The voice of truth and malice insensibly betrayed
the fraud or error of the Imperial court. The patrimonial estate of Hugo
was reduced from the monarchy of France to the simple county of Arles;
though it was not denied, that, in the confusion of the times, he had
usurped the sovereignty of Provence, and invaded the kingdom of Italy.
His father was a private noble; and if Bertha derived her female descent
from the Carlovingian line, every step was polluted with illegitimacy
or vice. The grandmother of Hugo was the famous Valdrada, the concubine,
rather than the wife, of the second Lothair; whose adultery, divorce,
and second nuptials, had provoked against him the thunders of
the Vatican. His mother, as she was styled, the great Bertha, was
successively the wife of the count of Arles and of the marquis of
Tuscany: France and Italy were scandalized by her gallantries; and, till
the age of threescore, her lovers, of every degree, were the zealous
servants of her ambition. The example of maternal incontinence was
copied by the king of Italy; and the three favorite concubines of Hugo
were decorated with the classic names of Venus, Juno, and Semele. <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a>
The daughter of Venus was granted to the solicitations of the Byzantine
court: her name of Bertha was changed to that of Eudoxia; and she was
wedded, or rather betrothed, to young Romanus, the future heir of
the empire of the East. The consummation of this foreign alliance was
suspended by the tender age of the two parties; and, at the end of five
years, the union was dissolved by the death of the virgin spouse. The
second wife of the emperor Romanus was a maiden of plebeian, but of
Roman, birth; and their two daughters, Theophano and Anne, were given
in marriage to the princes of the earth. The eldest was bestowed, as the
pledge of peace, on the eldest son of the great Otho, who had solicited
this alliance with arms and embassies. It might legally be questioned
how far a Saxon was entitled to the privilege of the French nation;
but every scruple was silenced by the fame and piety of a hero who had
restored the empire of the West. After the death of her father-in-law
and husband, Theophano governed Rome, Italy, and Germany, during the
minority of her son, the third Otho; and the Latins have praised the
virtues of an empress, who sacrificed to a superior duty the remembrance
of her country. <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> In the nuptials of her sister Anne, every prejudice
was lost, and every consideration of dignity was superseded, by
the stronger argument of necessity and fear. A Pagan of the North,
Wolodomir, great prince of Russia, aspired to a daughter of the Roman
purple; and his claim was enforced by the threats of war, the promise of
conversion, and the offer of a powerful succor against a domestic rebel.
A victim of her religion and country, the Grecian princess was torn
from the palace of her fathers, and condemned to a savage reign, and a
hopeless exile on the banks of the Borysthenes, or in the neighborhood
of the Polar circle. <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> Yet the marriage of Anne was fortunate and
fruitful: the daughter of her grandson Joroslaus was recommended by her
Imperial descent; and the king of France, Henry I., sought a wife on the
last borders of Europe and Christendom. <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a>

In the Byzantine palace, the emperor was the first slave of the
ceremonies which he imposed, of the rigid forms which regulated each
word and gesture, besieged him in the palace, and violated the leisure
of his rural solitude. But the lives and fortunes of millions hung on
his arbitrary will; and the firmest minds, superior to the allurements
of pomp and luxury, may be seduced by the more active pleasure of
commanding their equals. The legislative and executive powers were
centred in the person of the monarch, and the last remains of the
authority of the senate were finally eradicated by Leo the philosopher.
<a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> A lethargy of servitude had benumbed the minds of the Greeks: in
the wildest tumults of rebellion they never aspired to the idea of a
free constitution; and the private character of the prince was the only
source and measure of their public happiness. Superstition rivetted
their chains; in the church of St. Sophia he was solemnly crowned by
the patriarch; at the foot of the altar, they pledged their passive and
unconditional obedience to his government and family. On his side he
engaged to abstain as much as possible from the capital punishments of
death and mutilation; his orthodox creed was subscribed with his own
hand, and he promised to obey the decrees of the seven synods, and the
canons of the holy church. <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> But the assurance of mercy was loose and
indefinite: he swore, not to his people, but to an invisible judge; and
except in the inexpiable guilt of heresy, the ministers of heaven were
always prepared to preach the indefeasible right, and to absolve the
venial transgressions, of their sovereign. The Greek ecclesiastics were
themselves the subjects of the civil magistrate: at the nod of a tyrant,
the bishops were created, or transferred, or deposed, or punished with
an ignominious death: whatever might be their wealth or influence, they
could never succeed like the Latin clergy in the establishment of an
independent republic; and the patriarch of Constantinople condemned,
what he secretly envied, the temporal greatness of his Roman brother.
Yet the exercise of boundless despotism is happily checked by the laws
of nature and necessity. In proportion to his wisdom and virtue, the
master of an empire is confined to the path of his sacred and laborious
duty. In proportion to his vice and folly, he drops the sceptre too
weighty for his hands; and the motions of the royal image are ruled by
the imperceptible thread of some minister or favorite, who undertakes
for his private interest to exercise the task of the public oppression.
In some fatal moment, the most absolute monarch may dread the reason
or the caprice of a nation of slaves; and experience has proved, that
whatever is gained in the extent, is lost in the safety and solidity, of
regal power.

Whatever titles a despot may assume, whatever claims he may assert, it
is on the sword that he must ultimately depend to guard him against his
foreign and domestic enemies. From the age of Charlemagne to that of the
Crusades, the world (for I overlook the remote monarchy of China) was
occupied and disputed by the three great empires or nations of the
Greeks, the Saracens, and the Franks. Their military strength may be
ascertained by a comparison of their courage, their arts and riches, and
their obedience to a supreme head, who might call into action all the
energies of the state. The Greeks, far inferior to their rivals in the
first, were superior to the Franks, and at least equal to the Saracens,
in the second and third of these warlike qualifications.
</p>
<p>
The wealth of the Greeks enabled them to purchase the service of the
poorer nations, and to maintain a naval power for the protection of
their coasts and the annoyance of their enemies. <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> A commerce of
mutual benefit exchanged the gold of Constantinople for the blood
of Sclavonians and Turks, the Bulgarians and Russians: their valor
contributed to the victories of Nicephorus and Zimisces; and if a
hostile people pressed too closely on the frontier, they were recalled
to the defence of their country, and the desire of peace, by the
well-managed attack of a more distant tribe. <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> The command of the
Mediterranean, from the mouth of the Tanais to the columns of
Hercules, was always claimed, and often possessed, by the successors of
Constantine. Their capital was filled with naval stores and dexterous
artificers: the situation of Greece and Asia, the long coasts, deep
gulfs, and numerous islands, accustomed their subjects to the exercise
of navigation; and the trade of Venice and Amalfi supplied a nursery of
seamen to the Imperial fleet. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> Since the time of the Peloponnesian
and Punic wars, the sphere of action had not been enlarged; and the
science of naval architecture appears to have declined. The art of
constructing those stupendous machines which displayed three, or six,
or ten, ranges of oars, rising above, or falling behind, each other,
was unknown to the ship-builders of Constantinople, as well as to the
mechanicians of modern days. <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> The Dromones, <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> or light galleys of
the Byzantine empire, were content with two tier of oars; each tier was
composed of five-and-twenty benches; and two rowers were seated on each
bench, who plied their oars on either side of the vessel. To these we
must add the captain or centurion, who, in time of action, stood erect
with his armor-bearer on the poop, two steersmen at the helm, and two
officers at the prow, the one to manage the anchor, the other to point
and play against the enemy the tube of liquid fire. The whole crew, as
in the infancy of the art, performed the double service of mariners and
soldiers; they were provided with defensive and offensive arms, with
bows and arrows, which they used from the upper deck, with long pikes,
which they pushed through the portholes of the lower tier. Sometimes,
indeed, the ships of war were of a larger and more solid construction;
and the labors of combat and navigation were more regularly divided
between seventy soldiers and two hundred and thirty mariners. But for
the most part they were of the light and manageable size; and as
the Cape of Malea in Peloponnesus was still clothed with its ancient
terrors, an Imperial fleet was transported five miles over land across
the Isthmus of Corinth. <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> The principles of maritime tactics had not
undergone any change since the time of Thucydides: a squadron of galleys
still advanced in a crescent, charged to the front, and strove to impel
their sharp beaks against the feeble sides of their antagonists. A
machine for casting stones and darts was built of strong timbers, in the
midst of the deck; and the operation of boarding was effected by a crane
that hoisted baskets of armed men. The language of signals, so clear and
copious in the naval grammar of the moderns, was imperfectly expressed
by the various positions and colors of a commanding flag. In the
darkness of the night, the same orders to chase, to attack, to halt, to
retreat, to break, to form, were conveyed by the lights of the leading
galley. By land, the fire-signals were repeated from one mountain to
another; a chain of eight stations commanded a space of five hundred
miles; and Constantinople in a few hours was apprised of the hostile
motions of the Saracens of Tarsus. <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> Some estimate may be formed of
the power of the Greek emperors, by the curious and minute detail of the
armament which was prepared for the reduction of Crete. A fleet of one
hundred and twelve galleys, and seventy-five vessels of the Pamphylian
style, was equipped in the capital, the islands of the Aegean Sea, and
the seaports of Asia, Macedonia, and Greece. It carried thirty-four
thousand mariners, seven thousand three hundred and forty soldiers,
seven hundred Russians, and five thousand and eighty-seven Mardaites,
whose fathers had been transplanted from the mountains of Libanus. Their
pay, most probably of a month, was computed at thirty-four centenaries
of gold, about one hundred and thirty-six thousand pounds sterling. Our
fancy is bewildered by the endless recapitulation of arms and engines,
of clothes and linen, of bread for the men and forage for the horses,
and of stores and utensils of every description, inadequate to the
conquest of a petty island, but amply sufficient for the establishment
of a flourishing colony. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a>

The invention of the Greek fire did not, like that of gun powder,
produce a total revolution in the art of war. To these liquid
combustibles the city and empire of Constantine owed their deliverance;
and they were employed in sieges and sea-fights with terrible effect.
But they were either less improved, or less susceptible of improvement:
the engines of antiquity, the catapultae, balistae, and battering-rams,
were still of most frequent and powerful use in the attack and defence
of fortifications; nor was the decision of battles reduced to the quick
and heavy fire of a line of infantry, whom it were fruitless to protect
with armor against a similar fire of their enemies. Steel and iron were
still the common instruments of destruction and safety; and the helmets,
cuirasses, and shields, of the tenth century did not, either in form
or substance, essentially differ from those which had covered the
companions of Alexander or Achilles. <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> But instead of accustoming the
modern Greeks, like the legionaries of old, to the constant and easy use
of this salutary weight, their armor was laid aside in light chariots,
which followed the march, till, on the approach of an enemy, they
resumed with haste and reluctance the unusual encumbrance. Their
offensive weapons consisted of swords, battle-axes, and spears; but the
Macedonian pike was shortened a fourth of its length, and reduced to the
more convenient measure of twelve cubits or feet. The sharpness of the
Scythian and Arabian arrows had been severely felt; and the emperors
lament the decay of archery as a cause of the public misfortunes, and
recommend, as an advice and a command, that the military youth, till the
age of forty, should assiduously practise the exercise of the bow. <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a>
The bands, or regiments, were usually three hundred strong; and, as a
medium between the extremes of four and sixteen, the foot soldiers of
Leo and Constantine were formed eight deep; but the cavalry charged in
four ranks, from the reasonable consideration, that the weight of the
front could not be increased by any pressure of the hindmost horses.
If the ranks of the infantry or cavalry were sometimes doubled, this
cautious array betrayed a secret distrust of the courage of the troops,
whose numbers might swell the appearance of the line, but of whom only
a chosen band would dare to encounter the spears and swords of the
Barbarians. The order of battle must have varied according to the
ground, the object, and the adversary; but their ordinary disposition,
in two lines and a reserve, presented a succession of hopes and
resources most agreeable to the temper as well as the judgment of the
Greeks. <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> In case of a repulse, the first line fell back into the
intervals of the second; and the reserve, breaking into two divisions,
wheeled round the flanks to improve the victory or cover the retreat.
Whatever authority could enact was accomplished, at least in theory,
by the camps and marches, the exercises and evolutions, the edicts and
books, of the Byzantine monarch. <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> Whatever art could produce from
the forge, the loom, or the laboratory, was abundantly supplied by the
riches of the prince, and the industry of his numerous workmen. But
neither authority nor art could frame the most important machine, the
soldier himself; and if the ceremonies of Constantine always suppose the
safe and triumphal return of the emperor, <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> his tactics seldom soar
above the means of escaping a defeat, and procrastinating the war. <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a>
Notwithstanding some transient success, the Greeks were sunk in their
own esteem and that of their neighbors. A cold hand and a loquacious
tongue was the vulgar description of the nation: the author of the
tactics was besieged in his capital; and the last of the Barbarians, who
trembled at the name of the Saracens, or Franks, could proudly exhibit
the medals of gold and silver which they had extorted from the feeble
sovereign of Constantinople. What spirit their government and character
denied, might have been inspired in some degree by the influence of
religion; but the religion of the Greeks could only teach them to suffer
and to yield. The emperor Nicephorus, who restored for a moment the
discipline and glory of the Roman name, was desirous of bestowing the
honors of martyrdom on the Christians who lost their lives in a holy
war against the infidels. But this political law was defeated by the
opposition of the patriarch, the bishops, and the principal senators;
and they strenuously urged the canons of St. Basil, that all who were
polluted by the bloody trade of a soldier should be separated, during
three years, from the communion of the faithful. <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a>

<p>
These scruples of the Greeks have been compared with the tears of
the primitive Moslems when they were held back from battle; and this
contrast of base superstition and high-spirited enthusiasm, unfolds to
a philosophic eye the history of the rival nations. The subjects of the
last caliphs <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> had undoubtedly degenerated from the zeal and faith of
the companions of the prophet. Yet their martial creed still represented
the Deity as the author of war: <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> the vital though latent spark of
fanaticism still glowed in the heart of their religion, and among
the Saracens, who dwelt on the Christian borders, it was frequently
rekindled to a lively and active flame. Their regular force was formed
of the valiant slaves who had been educated to guard the person and
accompany the standard of their lord: but the Mussulman people of Syria
and Cilicia, of Africa and Spain, was awakened by the trumpet which
proclaimed a holy war against the infidels. The rich were ambitious of
death or victory in the cause of God; the poor were allured by the hopes
of plunder; and the old, the infirm, and the women, assumed their share
of meritorious service by sending their substitutes, with arms and
horses, into the field. These offensive and defensive arms were similar
in strength and temper to those of the Romans, whom they far excelled
in the management of the horse and the bow: the massy silver of their
belts, their bridles, and their swords, displayed the magnificence of a
prosperous nation; and except some black archers of the South, the Arabs
disdained the naked bravery of their ancestors. Instead of wagons, they
were attended by a long train of camels, mules, and asses: the multitude
of these animals, whom they bedecked with flags and streamers, appeared
to swell the pomp and magnitude of their host; and the horses of the
enemy were often disordered by the uncouth figure and odious smell of
the camels of the East. Invincible by their patience of thirst and heat,
their spirits were frozen by a winter's cold, and the consciousness of
their propensity to sleep exacted the most rigorous precautions against
the surprises of the night. Their order of battle was a long square of
two deep and solid lines; the first of archers, the second of cavalry.
In their engagements by sea and land, they sustained with patient
firmness the fury of the attack, and seldom advanced to the charge till
they could discern and oppress the lassitude of their foes. But if
they were repulsed and broken, they knew not how to rally or renew the
combat; and their dismay was heightened by the superstitious prejudice,
that God had declared himself on the side of their enemies. The decline
and fall of the caliphs countenanced this fearful opinion; nor were
there wanting, among the Mahometans and Christians, some obscure
prophecies <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> which prognosticated their alternate defeats. The unity
of the Arabian empire was dissolved, but the independent fragments were
equal to populous and powerful kingdoms; and in their naval and military
armaments, an emir of Aleppo or Tunis might command no despicable fund
of skill, and industry, and treasure. In their transactions of peace and
war with the Saracens, the princes of Constantinople too often felt that
these Barbarians had nothing barbarous in their discipline; and that
if they were destitute of original genius, they had been endowed with
a quick spirit of curiosity and imitation. The model was indeed more
perfect than the copy; their ships, and engines, and fortifications,
were of a less skilful construction; and they confess, without shame,
that the same God who has given a tongue to the Arabians, had more
nicely fashioned the hands of the Chinese, and the heads of the Greeks.

<h2>
    Chapter LIII: Fate Of The Eastern Empire.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
A name of some German tribes between the Rhine and the Weser had spread
its victorious influence over the greatest part of Gaul, Germany, and
Italy; and the common appellation of Franks <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> was applied by the
Greeks and Arabians to the Christians of the Latin church, the nations
of the West, who stretched beyond their knowledge to the shores of the
Atlantic Ocean. The vast body had been inspired and united by the
soul of Charlemagne; but the division and degeneracy of his race soon
annihilated the Imperial power, which would have rivalled the Caesars
of Byzantium, and revenged the indignities of the Christian name. The
enemies no longer feared, nor could the subjects any longer trust, the
application of a public revenue, the labors of trade and manufactures
in the military service, the mutual aid of provinces and armies, and
the naval squadrons which were regularly stationed from the mouth of the
Elbe to that of the Tyber. In the beginning of the tenth century, the
family of Charlemagne had almost disappeared; his monarchy was broken
into many hostile and independent states; the regal title was assumed
by the most ambitious chiefs; their revolt was imitated in a long
subordination of anarchy and discord, and the nobles of every province
disobeyed their sovereign, oppressed their vassals, and exercised
perpetual hostilities against their equals and neighbors. Their private
wars, which overturned the fabric of government, fomented the martial
spirit of the nation. In the system of modern Europe, the power of the
sword is possessed, at least in fact, by five or six mighty potentates;
their operations are conducted on a distant frontier, by an order of men
who devote their lives to the study and practice of the military art:
the rest of the country and community enjoys in the midst of war the
tranquillity of peace, and is only made sensible of the change by the
aggravation or decrease of the public taxes. In the disorders of the
tenth and eleventh centuries, every peasant was a soldier, and every
village a fortification; each wood or valley was a scene of murder
and rapine; and the lords of each castle were compelled to assume the
character of princes and warriors. To their own courage and policy they
boldly trusted for the safety of their family, the protection of their
lands, and the revenge of their injuries; and, like the conquerors of a
larger size, they were too apt to transgress the privilege of defensive
war. The powers of the mind and body were hardened by the presence of
danger and necessity of resolution: the same spirit refused to desert
a friend and to forgive an enemy; and, instead of sleeping under the

corrupted; and the bishop who exchanged his mitre for a helmet, was more
forcibly urged by the manners of the times than by the obligation of his
tenure. <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a>

The love of freedom and of arms was felt, with conscious pride, by the
Franks themselves, and is observed by the Greeks with some degree of
amazement and terror. "The Franks," says the emperor Constantine, "are
bold and valiant to the verge of temerity; and their dauntless spirit is
supported by the contempt of danger and death. In the field and in close
onset, they press to the front, and rush headlong against the enemy,
without deigning to compute either his numbers or their own. Their ranks
are formed by the firm connections of consanguinity and friendship; and
their martial deeds are prompted by the desire of saving or revenging
their dearest companions. In their eyes, a retreat is a shameful flight;
and flight is indelible infamy." <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a> A nation endowed with such
high and intrepid spirit, must have been secure of victory if these
advantages had not been counter-balanced by many weighty defects. The
decay of their naval power left the Greeks and Saracens in possession
of the sea, for every purpose of annoyance and supply. In the age
which preceded the institution of knighthood, the Franks were rude
and unskilful in the service of cavalry; <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a> and in all perilous
emergencies, their warriors were so conscious of their ignorance, that
they chose to dismount from their horses and fight on foot. Unpractised
in the use of pikes, or of missile weapons, they were encumbered by
the length of their swords, the weight of their armor, the magnitude of
their shields, and, if I may repeat the satire of the meagre Greeks, by
their unwieldy intemperance. Their independent spirit disdained the
yoke of subordination, and abandoned the standard of their chief, if
he attempted to keep the field beyond the term of their stipulation
or service. On all sides they were open to the snares of an enemy less
brave but more artful than themselves. They might be bribed, for the
Barbarians were venal; or surprised in the night, for they neglected the
precautions of a close encampment or vigilant sentinels. The fatigues of
a summer's campaign exhausted their strength and patience, and they sunk
in despair if their voracious appetite was disappointed of a plentiful
supply of wine and of food. This general character of the Franks was
marked with some national and local shades, which I should ascribe to
accident rather than to climate, but which were visible both to natives
and to foreigners. An ambassador of the great Otho declared, in the
palace of Constantinople, that the Saxons could dispute with swords
better than with pens, and that they preferred inevitable death to the
dishonor of turning their backs to an enemy. <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> It was the glory of
the nobles of France, that, in their humble dwellings, war and rapine
were the only pleasure, the sole occupation, of their lives. They
affected to deride the palaces, the banquets, the polished manner of the
Italians, who in the estimate of the Greeks themselves had degenerated
from the liberty and valor of the ancient Lombards. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a>

By the well-known edict of Caracalla, his subjects, from Britain to
Egypt, were entitled to the name and privileges of Romans, and their
national sovereign might fix his occasional or permanent residence in
any province of their common country. In the division of the East and
West, an ideal unity was scrupulously observed, and in their titles,
laws, and statutes, the successors of Arcadius and Honorius announced
themselves as the inseparable colleagues of the same office, as the
joint sovereigns of the Roman world and city, which were bounded by the
same limits. After the fall of the Western monarchy, the majesty of the
purple resided solely in the princes of Constantinople; and of these,
Justinian was the first who, after a divorce of sixty years, regained
the dominion of ancient Rome, and asserted, by the right of conquest,
the august title of Emperor of the Romans. <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> A motive of vanity or
discontent solicited one of his successors, Constans the Second, to
abandon the Thracian Bosphorus, and to restore the pristine honors of
the Tyber: an extravagant project, (exclaims the malicious Byzantine,)
as if he had despoiled a beautiful and blooming virgin, to enrich, or
rather to expose, the deformity of a wrinkled and decrepit matron.
<a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> But the sword of the Lombards opposed his settlement in Italy: he
entered Rome not as a conqueror, but as a fugitive, and, after a visit
of twelve days, he pillaged, and forever deserted, the ancient capital
of the world. <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> The final revolt and separation of Italy was
accomplished about two centuries after the conquests of Justinian, and
from his reign we may date the gradual oblivion of the Latin tongue.
That legislator had composed his Institutes, his Code, and his Pandects,
in a language which he celebrates as the proper and public style of
the Roman government, the consecrated idiom of the palace and senate of
Constantinople, of the campus and tribunals of the East. <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> But this
foreign dialect was unknown to the people and soldiers of the Asiatic
provinces, it was imperfectly understood by the greater part of the
interpreters of the laws and the ministers of the state. After a short
conflict, nature and habit prevailed over the obsolete institutions
of human power: for the general benefit of his subjects, Justinian
promulgated his novels in the two languages: the several parts of his
voluminous jurisprudence were successively translated; <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> the original
was forgotten, the version was studied, and the Greek, whose intrinsic
merit deserved indeed the preference, obtained a legal, as well as
popular establishment in the Byzantine monarchy. The birth and residence
of succeeding princes estranged them from the Roman idiom: Tiberius by
the Arabs, <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> and Maurice by the Italians, <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> are distinguished
as the first of the Greek Caesars, as the founders of a new dynasty
and empire: the silent revolution was accomplished before the death of
Heraclius; and the ruins of the Latin speech were darkly preserved in
the terms of jurisprudence and the acclamations of the palace. After
the restoration of the Western empire by Charlemagne and the Othos, the
names of Franks and Latins acquired an equal signification and extent;
and these haughty Barbarians asserted, with some justice, their superior
claim to the language and dominion of Rome. They insulted the alien
of the East who had renounced the dress and idiom of Romans; and their
reasonable practice will justify the frequent appellation of Greeks.
<a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> But this contemptuous appellation was indignantly rejected by the
prince and people to whom it was applied. Whatsoever changes had been
introduced by the lapse of ages, they alleged a lineal and unbroken
succession from Augustus and Constantine; and, in the lowest period of
degeneracy and decay, the name of Romans adhered to the last fragments
of the empire of Constantinople. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a>

While the government of the East was transacted in Latin, the Greek was
the language of literature and philosophy; nor could the masters of
this rich and perfect idiom be tempted to envy the borrowed learning and
imitative taste of their Roman disciples. After the fall of Paganism,
the loss of Syria and Egypt, and the extinction of the schools of
Alexandria and Athens, the studies of the Greeks insensibly retired
to some regular monasteries, and above all, to the royal college of
Constantinople, which was burnt in the reign of Leo the Isaurian. <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a>
In the pompous style of the age, the president of that foundation was

In the ninth century we trace the first dawnings of the restoration
of science. <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> After the fanaticism of the Arabs had subsided, the
caliphs aspired to conquer the arts, rather than the provinces, of the
empire: their liberal curiosity rekindled the emulation of the Greeks,
brushed away the dust from their ancient libraries, and taught them to
know and reward the philosophers, whose labors had been hitherto repaid
by the pleasure of study and the pursuit of truth. The Caesar Bardas,
the uncle of Michael the Third, was the generous protector of letters,
a title which alone has preserved his memory and excused his ambition. A
particle of the treasures of his nephew was sometimes diverted from
the indulgence of vice and folly; a school was opened in the palace
of Magnaura; and the presence of Bardas excited the emulation of the
masters and students. At their head was the philosopher Leo, archbishop
of Thessalonica: his profound skill in astronomy and the mathematics
was admired by the strangers of the East; and this occult science
was magnified by vulgar credulity, which modestly supposes that all
knowledge superior to its own must be the effect of inspiration
or magic. At the pressing entreaty of the Caesar, his friend, the
celebrated Photius, <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a> renounced the freedom of a secular and
studious life, ascended the patriarchal throne, and was alternately
excommunicated and absolved by the synods of the East and West. By the
confession even of priestly hatred, no art or science, except poetry,
was foreign to this universal scholar, who was deep in thought,
indefatigable in reading, and eloquent in diction. Whilst he exercised
the office of protospathaire or captain of the guards, Photius was sent
ambassador to the caliph of Bagdad. <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> The tedious hours of exile,
perhaps of confinement, were beguiled by the hasty composition of his
Library, a living monument of erudition and criticism. Two hundred and
fourscore writers, historians, orators, philosophers, theologians, are
reviewed without any regular method: he abridges their narrative or
doctrine, appreciates their style and character, and judges even the
fathers of the church with a discreet freedom, which often breaks
through the superstition of the times. The emperor Basil, who lamented
the defects of his own education, intrusted to the care of Photius his
son and successor, Leo the philosopher; and the reign of that prince and
of his son Constantine Porphyrogenitus forms one of the most prosperous
aeras of the Byzantine literature. By their munificence the treasures
of antiquity were deposited in the Imperial library; by their pens,
or those of their associates, they were imparted in such extracts
and abridgments as might amuse the curiosity, without oppressing the
indolence, of the public. Besides the Basilics, or code of laws, the
arts of husbandry and war, of feeding or destroying the human species,
were propagated with equal diligence; and the history of Greece and Rome
was digested into fifty-three heads or titles, of which two only (of
embassies, and of virtues and vices) have escaped the injuries of time.
In every station, the reader might contemplate the image of the past
world, apply the lesson or warning of each page, and learn to admire,
perhaps to imitate, the examples of a brighter period. I shall not
expatiate on the works of the Byzantine Greeks, who, by the assiduous
study of the ancients, have deserved, in some measure, the remembrance
and gratitude of the moderns. The scholars of the present age may still
enjoy the benefit of the philosophical commonplace book of Stobaeus, the
grammatical and historical lexicon of Suidas, the Chiliads of Tzetzes,
which comprise six hundred narratives in twelve thousand verses, and the
commentaries on Homer of Eustathius, archbishop of Thessalonica, who,
from his horn of plenty, has poured the names and authorities of four
hundred writers. From these originals, and from the numerous tribe
of scholiasts and critics, <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> some estimate may be formed of the
literary wealth of the twelfth century: Constantinople was enlightened
by the genius of Homer and Demosthenes, of Aristotle and Plato: and
in the enjoyment or neglect of our present riches, we must envy the
generation that could still peruse the history of Theopompus, the
orations of Hyperides, the comedies of Menander, <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> and the odes of
Alcaeus and Sappho. The frequent labor of illustration attests not only
the existence, but the popularity, of the Grecian classics: the general
knowledge of the age may be deduced from the example of two learned
females, the empress Eudocia, and the princess Anna Comnena, who
cultivated, in the purple, the arts of rhetoric and philosophy. <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a>
The vulgar dialect of the city was gross and barbarous: a more correct
and elaborate style distinguished the discourse, or at least the
compositions, of the church and palace, which sometimes affected to copy
the purity of the Attic models.

In our modern education, the painful though necessary attainment of two
languages, which are no longer living, may consume the time and damp
the ardor of the youthful student. The poets and orators were long
imprisoned in the barbarous dialects of our Western ancestors, devoid
of harmony or grace; and their genius, without precept or example, was
abandoned to the rule and native powers of their judgment and fancy. But
the Greeks of Constantinople, after purging away the impurities of their
vulgar speech, acquired the free use of their ancient language, the most
happy composition of human art, and a familiar knowledge of the sublime
masters who had pleased or instructed the first of nations. But these
advantages only tend to aggravate the reproach and shame of a degenerate
people. They held in their lifeless hands the riches of their fathers,
without inheriting the spirit which had created and improved that sacred
patrimony: they read, they praised, they compiled, but their languid
souls seemed alike incapable of thought and action. In the revolution of
ten centuries, not a single discovery was made to exalt the dignity or
promote the happiness of mankind. Not a single idea has been added
to the speculative systems of antiquity, and a succession of patient
disciples became in their turn the dogmatic teachers of the next
servile generation. Not a single composition of history, philosophy, or
literature, has been saved from oblivion by the intrinsic beauties of
style or sentiment, of original fancy, or even of successful imitation.
In prose, the least offensive of the Byzantine writers are absolved from
censure by their naked and unpresuming simplicity: but the orators, most
eloquent <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> in their own conceit, are the farthest removed from the
models whom they affect to emulate. In every page our taste and reason
are wounded by the choice of gigantic and obsolete words, a stiff and
intricate phraseology, the discord of images, the childish play of false
or unseasonable ornament, and the painful attempt to elevate themselves,
to astonish the reader, and to involve a trivial meaning in the smoke
of obscurity and exaggeration. Their prose is soaring to the vicious
affectation of poetry: their poetry is sinking below the flatness and
insipidity of prose. The tragic, epic, and lyric muses, were silent and
inglorious: the bards of Constantinople seldom rose above a riddle or
epigram, a panegyric or tale; they forgot even the rules of prosody; and
with the melody of Homer yet sounding in their ears, they confound
all measure of feet and syllables in the impotent strains which have
received the name of political or city verses. <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> The minds of the
Greek were bound in the fetters of a base and imperious superstition
which extends her dominion round the circle of profane science. Their
understandings were bewildered in metaphysical controversy: in the
belief of visions and miracles, they had lost all principles of moral
evidence, and their taste was vitiates by the homilies of the monks,
an absurd medley of declamation and Scripture. Even these contemptible
studies were no longer dignified by the abuse of superior talents: the
leaders of the Greek church were humbly content to admire and copy the
oracles of antiquity, nor did the schools of pulpit produce any rivals
of the fame of Athanasius and Chrysostom. <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a>

their easiness, they are styled by Leo Allatius, usually consist of
fifteen syllables. They are used by Constantine Manasses, John Tzetzes,

1762.)]

In all the pursuits of active and speculative life, the emulation of
states and individuals is the most powerful spring of the efforts and
improvements of mankind. The cities of ancient Greece were cast in the
happy mixture of union and independence, which is repeated on a larger
scale, but in a looser form, by the nations of modern Europe; the union
of language, religion, and manners, which renders them the spectators
and judges of each other's merit; <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> the independence of government
and interest, which asserts their separate freedom, and excites them
to strive for preeminence in the career of glory. The situation of the
Romans was less favorable; yet in the early ages of the republic, which
fixed the national character, a similar emulation was kindled among the
states of Latium and Italy; and in the arts and sciences, they aspired
to equal or surpass their Grecian masters. The empire of the Caesars
undoubtedly checked the activity and progress of the human mind; its
magnitude might indeed allow some scope for domestic competition; but
when it was gradually reduced, at first to the East and at last to
Greece and Constantinople, the Byzantine subjects were degraded to an
abject and languid temper, the natural effect of their solitary and
insulated state. From the North they were oppressed by nameless tribes
of Barbarians, to whom they scarcely imparted the appellation of
men. The language and religion of the more polished Arabs were an
insurmountable bar to all social intercourse. The conquerors of Europe
were their brethren in the Christian faith; but the speech of the Franks
or Latins was unknown, their manners were rude, and they were rarely
connected, in peace or war, with the successors of Heraclius. Alone in
the universe, the self-satisfied pride of the Greeks was not disturbed
by the comparison of foreign merit; and it is no wonder if they fainted
in the race, since they had neither competitors to urge their speed,
nor judges to crown their victory. The nations of Europe and Asia
were mingled by the expeditions to the Holy Land; and it is under the
Comnenian dynasty that a faint emulation of knowledge and military
virtue was rekindled in the Byzantine empire.
