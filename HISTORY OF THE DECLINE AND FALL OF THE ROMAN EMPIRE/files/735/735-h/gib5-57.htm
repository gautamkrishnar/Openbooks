From the Isle of Sicily, the reader must transport himself beyond the
Caspian Sea, to the original seat of the Turks or Turkmans, against whom
the first crusade was principally directed. Their Scythian empire of the
sixth century was long since dissolved; but the name was still famous
among the Greeks and Orientals; and the fragments of the nation, each
a powerful and independent people, were scattered over the desert from
China to the Oxus and the Danube: the colony of Hungarians was admitted
into the republic of Europe, and the thrones of Asia were occupied by
slaves and soldiers of Turkish extraction. While Apulia and Sicily
were subdued by the Norman lance, a swarm of these northern shepherds
overspread the kingdoms of Persia; their princes of the race of Seljuk
erected a splendid and solid empire from Samarcand to the confines of
Greece and Egypt; and the Turks have maintained their dominion in Asia
Minor, till the victorious crescent has been planted on the dome of St.
Sophia.
</p>
<p>
One of the greatest of the Turkish princes was Mahmood or Mahmud, <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a>
the Gaznevide, who reigned in the eastern provinces of Persia, one
thousand years after the birth of Christ. His father Sebectagi was the
slave of the slave of the slave of the commander of the faithful. But in
this descent of servitude, the first degree was merely titular, since it
was filled by the sovereign of Transoxiana and Chorasan, who still paid
a nominal allegiance to the caliph of Bagdad. The second rank was that
of a minister of state, a lieutenant of the Samanides, <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> who broke,
by his revolt, the bonds of political slavery. But the third step was a
state of real and domestic servitude in the family of that rebel; from
which Sebectagi, by his courage and dexterity, ascended to the supreme
command of the city and provinces of Gazna, <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> as the son-in-law and
successor of his grateful master.
</p>
<p>
The falling dynasty of the Samanides was at first protected, and at last
overthrown, by their servants; and, in the public disorders, the fortune
of Mahmud continually increased. From him the title of Sultan <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> was
first invented; and his kingdom was enlarged from Transoxiana to the
neighborhood of Ispahan, from the shores of the Caspian to the mouth of
the Indus. But the principal source of his fame and riches was the holy
war which he waged against the Gentoos of Hindostan. In this foreign
narrative I may not consume a page; and a volume would scarcely suffice
to recapitulate the battles and sieges of his twelve expeditions. Never
was the Mussulman hero dismayed by the inclemency of the seasons, the
height of the mountains, the breadth of the rivers, the barrenness of
the desert, the multitudes of the enemy, or the formidable array of
their elephants of war. <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> The sultan of Gazna surpassed the limits
of the conquests of Alexander: after a march of three months, over the
hills of Cashmir and Thibet, he reached the famous city of Kinnoge, <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a>
on the Upper Ganges; and, in a naval combat on one of the branches of
the Indus, he fought and vanquished four thousand boats of the natives.
Delhi, Lahor, and Multan, were compelled to open their gates: the
fertile kingdom of Guzarat attracted his ambition and tempted his stay;
and his avarice indulged the fruitless project of discovering the golden
and aromatic isles of the Southern Ocean. On the payment of a tribute,
the rajahs preserved their dominions; the people, their lives and
fortunes; but to the religion of Hindostan the zealous Mussulman was
cruel and inexorable: many hundred temples, or pagodas, were levelled
with the ground; many thousand idols were demolished; and the servants
of the prophet were stimulated and rewarded by the precious materials
of which they were composed. The pagoda of Sumnat was situate on the
promontory of Guzarat, in the neighborhood of Diu, one of the last
remaining possessions of the Portuguese. <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> It was endowed with the
revenue of two thousand villages; two thousand Brahmins were consecrated
to the service of the Deity, whom they washed each morning and evening
in water from the distant Ganges: the subordinate ministers consisted of
three hundred musicians, three hundred barbers, and five hundred dancing
girls, conspicuous for their birth or beauty. Three sides of the temple
were protected by the ocean, the narrow isthmus was fortified by a
natural or artificial precipice; and the city and adjacent country
were peopled by a nation of fanatics. They confessed the sins and the
punishment of Kinnoge and Delhi; but if the impious stranger should
presume to approach their holy precincts, he would surely be overwhelmed
by a blast of the divine vengeance. By this challenge, the faith of
Mahmud was animated to a personal trial of the strength of this Indian
deity. Fifty thousand of his worshippers were pierced by the spear of
the Moslems; the walls were scaled; the sanctuary was profaned; and the
conqueror aimed a blow of his iron mace at the head of the idol. The
trembling Brahmins are said to have offered ten millions <a href="#note-711" name="noteref-711"><small>711</small></a> sterling
for his ransom; and it was urged by the wisest counsellors, that the
destruction of a stone image would not change the hearts of the Gentoos;
and that such a sum might be dedicated to the relief of the true
believers. "Your reasons," replied the sultan, "are specious and strong;
but never in the eyes of posterity shall Mahmud appear as a merchant
of idols." <a href="#note-712" name="noteref-712"><small>712</small></a> He repeated his blows, and a treasure of pearls and
rubies, concealed in the belly of the statue, explained in some degree
the devout prodigality of the Brahmins. The fragments of the idol were
distributed to Gazna, Mecca, and Medina. Bagdad listened to the edifying
tale; and Mahmud was saluted by the caliph with the title of guardian of
the fortune and faith of Mahomet.

(Bibliotheque Orientale, Mahmud, p. 533-537,) M. De Guignes, (Histoire
des Huns, tom. iii. p. 155-173,) and our countryman Colonel Alexander
Dow, (vol. i. p. 23-83.) In the two first volumes of his History of
Hindostan, he styles himself the translator of the Persian Ferishta; but
in his florid text, it is not easy to distinguish the version and the
original. * Note: The European reader now possesses a more accurate
version of Ferishta, that of Col. Briggs. Of Col. Dow's work, Col.
Briggs observes, "that the author's name will be handed down to
posterity as one of the earliest and most indefatigable of our Oriental
scholars. Instead of confining himself, however, to mere translation,
he has filled his work with his own observations, which have been so
embodied in the text that Gibbon declares it impossible to distinguish
the translator from the original author." Preface p. vii.&mdash;M.]

century; and the name (Soldanus) is familiarly employed in the Greek
and Latin languages, after it had passed from the Gaznevides to the
Seljukides, and other emirs of Asia and Egypt. Ducange (Dissertation
xvi. sur Joinville, p. 238-240. Gloss. Graec. et Latin.) labors to find
the title of Sultan in the ancient kingdom of Persia: but his proofs are
mere shadows; a proper name in the Themes of Constantine, (ii. 11,) an
anticipation of Zonaras, &amp;c., and a medal of Kai Khosrou, not (as he
believes) the Sassanide of the vith, but the Seljukide of Iconium of the
xiiith century, (De Guignes, Hist. des Huns, tom. i. p. 246.)]

mentions the report of a gun in the Indian army. But as I am slow in
believing this premature (A.D. 1008) use of artillery, I must desire to
scrutinize first the text, and then the authority of Ferishta, who
lived in the Mogul court in the last century. * Note: This passage is
differently written in the various manuscripts I have seen; and in some
the word tope (gun) has been written for nupth, (naphtha, and toofung)
(musket) for khudung, (arrow.) But no Persian or Arabic history speaks
of gunpowder before the time usually assigned for its invention, (A.D.
1317;) long after which, it was first applied to the purposes of war.

at the bottom of the page, "ten millions," which is the explanation of
the word "crore." Mr. Gibbon says rashly that the sum offered by the
Brahmins was ten millions sterling. Note to Mill's India, vol. ii. p.
222. Col. Briggs's translation is "a quantity of gold." The treasure
found in the temple, "perhaps in the image," according to Major Price's
authorities, was twenty millions of dinars of gold, above nine millions
sterling; but this was a hundred-fold the ransom offered by the
Brahmins. Price, vol. ii. p. 290.&mdash;M.]

</p>
<p>
From the paths of blood (and such is the history of nations) I cannot
refuse to turn aside to gather some flowers of science or virtue.
The name of Mahmud the Gaznevide is still venerable in the East: his
subjects enjoyed the blessings of prosperity and peace; his vices
were concealed by the veil of religion; and two familiar examples will
testify his justice and magnanimity.
</p>
<p>
I. As he sat in the Divan, an unhappy subject bowed before the throne to
accuse the insolence of a Turkish soldier who had driven him from his
house and bed. "Suspend your clamors," said Mahmud; "inform me of his
next visit, and ourself in person will judge and punish the offender."
The sultan followed his guide, invested the house with his guards, and
extinguishing the torches, pronounced the death of the criminal, who had
been seized in the act of rapine and adultery. After the execution of
his sentence, the lights were rekindled, Mahmud fell prostrate in
prayer, and rising from the ground, demanded some homely fare, which he
devoured with the voraciousness of hunger. The poor man, whose injury he
had avenged, was unable to suppress his astonishment and curiosity; and
the courteous monarch condescended to explain the motives of this
singular behavior. "I had reason to suspect that none, except one of my
sons, could dare to perpetrate such an outrage; and I extinguished the
lights, that my justice might be blind and inexorable. My prayer was a
thanksgiving on the discovery of the offender; and so painful was my
anxiety, that I had passed three days without food since the first
moment of your complaint." 
</p>
<p>
II. The sultan of Gazna had declared war against the dynasty of the
Bowides, the sovereigns of the western Persia: he was disarmed by an
epistle of the sultana mother, and delayed his invasion till the manhood
of her son. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> "During the life of my husband," said the artful regent,
"I was ever apprehensive of your ambition: he was a prince and a soldier
worthy of your arms. He is now no more his sceptre has passed to a woman
and a child, and you dare not attack their infancy and weakness. How
inglorious would be your conquest, how shameful your defeat! and yet the
event of war is in the hand of the Almighty." Avarice was the only
defect that tarnished the illustrious character of Mahmud; and never has
that passion been more richly satiated. <a href="#note-811" name="noteref-811"><small>811</small></a> The Orientals exceed the
measure of credibility in the account of millions of gold and silver,
such as the avidity of man has never accumulated; in the magnitude of
pearls, diamonds, and rubies, such as have never been produced by the
workmanship of nature. <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> Yet the soil of Hindostan is impregnated with
precious minerals: her trade, in every age, has attracted the gold and
silver of the world; and her virgin spoils were rifled by the first of
the Mahometan conquerors. His behavior, in the last days of his life,
evinces the vanity of these possessions, so laboriously won, so
dangerously held, and so inevitably lost. He surveyed the vast and
various chambers of the treasury of Gazna, burst into tears, and again
closed the doors, without bestowing any portion of the wealth which he
could no longer hope to preserve. The following day he reviewed the
state of his military force; one hundred thousand foot, fifty-five
thousand horse, and thirteen hundred elephants of battle. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> He again
wept the instability of human greatness; and his grief was imbittered by
the hostile progress of the Turkmans, whom he had introduced into the
heart of his Persian kingdom.

</p>
<p>
In the modern depopulation of Asia, the regular operation of government
and agriculture is confined to the neighborhood of cities; and the
distant country is abandoned to the pastoral tribes of Arabs, Curds, and
Turkmans. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> Of the last-mentioned people, two considerable branches
extend on either side of the Caspian Sea: the western colony can muster
forty thousand soldiers; the eastern, less obvious to the traveller,
but more strong and populous, has increased to the number of one hundred
thousand families. In the midst of civilized nations, they preserve the
manners of the Scythian desert, remove their encampments with a change
of seasons, and feed their cattle among the ruins of palaces and
temples. Their flocks and herds are their only riches; their tents,
either black or white, according to the color of the banner, are covered
with felt, and of a circular form; their winter apparel is a sheep-skin;
a robe of cloth or cotton their summer garment: the features of the
men are harsh and ferocious; the countenance of their women is soft
and pleasing. Their wandering life maintains the spirit and exercise
of arms; they fight on horseback; and their courage is displayed in
frequent contests with each other and with their neighbors. For the
license of pasture they pay a slight tribute to the sovereign of the
land; but the domestic jurisdiction is in the hands of the chiefs and
elders. The first emigration of the Eastern Turkmans, the most ancient
of the race, may be ascribed to the tenth century of the Christian
aera. <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> In the decline of the caliphs, and the weakness of their
lieutenants, the barrier of the Jaxartes was often violated; in each
invasion, after the victory or retreat of their countrymen, some
wandering tribe, embracing the Mahometan faith, obtained a free
encampment in the spacious plains and pleasant climate of Transoxiana
and Carizme. The Turkish slaves who aspired to the throne encouraged
these emigrations which recruited their armies, awed their subjects
and rivals, and protected the frontier against the wilder natives of
Turkestan; and this policy was abused by Mahmud the Gaznevide beyond the
example of former times. He was admonished of his error by the chief of
the race of Seljuk, who dwelt in the territory of Bochara. The sultan
had inquired what supply of men he could furnish for military service.
"If you send," replied Ismael, "one of these arrows into our camp,
fifty thousand of your servants will mount on horseback."&mdash;"And if
that number," continued Mahmud, "should not be sufficient?"&mdash;"Send this
second arrow to the horde of Balik, and you will find fifty thousand
more."&mdash;"But," said the Gaznevide, dissembling his anxiety, "if I should
stand in need of the whole force of your kindred tribes?"&mdash;"Despatch my
bow," was the last reply of Ismael, "and as it is circulated around, the
summons will be obeyed by two hundred thousand horse." The apprehension
of such formidable friendship induced Mahmud to transport the most
obnoxious tribes into the heart of Chorasan, where they would be
separated from their brethren of the River Oxus, and enclosed on all
sides by the walls of obedient cities. But the face of the country was
an object of temptation rather than terror; and the vigor of government
was relaxed by the absence and death of the sultan of Gazna. The
shepherds were converted into robbers; the bands of robbers were
collected into an army of conquerors: as far as Ispahan and the Tigris,
Persia was afflicted by their predatory inroads; and the Turkmans were
not ashamed or afraid to measure their courage and numbers with the
proudest sovereigns of Asia. Massoud, the son and successor of Mahmud,
had too long neglected the advice of his wisest Omrahs. "Your enemies,"
they repeatedly urged, "were in their origin a swarm of ants; they are
now little snakes; and, unless they be instantly crushed, they will
acquire the venom and magnitude of serpents." After some alternatives
of truce and hostility, after the repulse or partial success of his
lieutenants, the sultan marched in person against the Turkmans, who
attacked him on all sides with barbarous shouts and irregular onset.
"Massoud," says the Persian historian, <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> "plunged singly to oppose
the torrent of gleaming arms, exhibiting such acts of gigantic force and
valor as never king had before displayed. A few of his friends, roused
by his words and actions, and that innate honor which inspires the
brave, seconded their lord so well, that wheresoever he turned his fatal
sword, the enemies were mowed down, or retreated before him. But now,
when victory seemed to blow on his standard, misfortune was active
behind it; for when he looked round, be beheld almost his whole army,
excepting that body he commanded in person, devouring the paths of
flight." The Gaznevide was abandoned by the cowardice or treachery of
some generals of Turkish race; and this memorable day of Zendecan <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a>
founded in Persia the dynasty of the shepherd kings. <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a>

<p>
The victorious Turkmans immediately proceeded to the election of a king;
and, if the probable tale of a Latin historian <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> deserves any credit,
they determined by lot the choice of their new master. A number of
arrows were successively inscribed with the name of a tribe, a family,
and a candidate; they were drawn from the bundle by the hand of a child;
and the important prize was obtained by Togrul Beg, the son of Michael
the son of Seljuk, whose surname was immortalized in the greatness of
his posterity. The sultan Mahmud, who valued himself on his skill in
national genealogy, professed his ignorance of the family of Seljuk;
yet the father of that race appears to have been a chief of power and
renown. <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> For a daring intrusion into the harem of his prince. Seljuk
was banished from Turkestan: with a numerous tribe of his friends
and vassals, he passed the Jaxartes, encamped in the neighborhood of
Samarcand, embraced the religion of Mahomet, and acquired the crown of
martyrdom in a war against the infidels. His age, of a hundred and seven
years, surpassed the life of his son, and Seljuk adopted the care of
his two grandsons, Togrul and Jaafar; the eldest of whom, at the age of
forty-five, was invested with the title of Sultan, in the royal city of
Nishabur. The blind determination of chance was justified by the virtues
of the successful candidate. It would be superfluous to praise the valor
of a Turk; and the ambition of Togrul <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> was equal to his valor. By
his arms, the Gasnevides were expelled from the eastern kingdoms of
Persia, and gradually driven to the banks of the Indus, in search of a
softer and more wealthy conquest. In the West he annihilated the dynasty
of the Bowides; and the sceptre of Irak passed from the Persian to the
Turkish nation. The princes who had felt, or who feared, the Seljukian
arrows, bowed their heads in the dust; by the conquest of Aderbijan, or
Media, he approached the Roman confines; and the shepherd presumed to
despatch an ambassador, or herald, to demand the tribute and obedience
of the emperor of Constantinople. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> In his own dominions, Togrul
was the father of his soldiers and people; by a firm and equal
administration, Persia was relieved from the evils of anarchy; and
the same hands which had been imbrued in blood became the guardians
of justice and the public peace. The more rustic, perhaps the wisest,
portion of the Turkmans <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> continued to dwell in the tents of their
ancestors; and, from the Oxus to the Euphrates, these military colonies
were protected and propagated by their native princes. But the Turks of
the court and city were refined by business and softened by pleasure:
they imitated the dress, language, and manners of Persia; and the royal
palaces of Nishabur and Rei displayed the order and magnificence of a
great monarchy. The most deserving of the Arabians and Persians were
promoted to the honors of the state; and the whole body of the Turkish
nation embraced, with fervor and sincerity, the religion of Mahomet. The
northern swarms of Barbarians, who overspread both Europe and Asia, have
been irreconcilably separated by the consequences of a similar conduct.
Among the Moslems, as among the Christians, their vague and local
traditions have yielded to the reason and authority of the prevailing
system, to the fame of antiquity, and the consent of nations. But
the triumph of the Koran is more pure and meritorious, as it was not
assisted by any visible splendor of worship which might allure the
Pagans by some resemblance of idolatry. The first of the Seljukian
sultans was conspicuous by his zeal and faith: each day he repeated the
five prayers which are enjoined to the true believers; of each week, the
two first days were consecrated by an extraordinary fast; and in
every city a mosch was completed, before Togrul presumed to lay the
foundations of a palace. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a>

<p>
With the belief of the Koran, the son of Seljuk imbibed a lively
reverence for the successor of the prophet. But that sublime character
was still disputed by the caliphs of Bagdad and Egypt, and each of the
rivals was solicitous to prove his title in the judgment of the strong,
though illiterate Barbarians. Mahmud the Gaznevide had declared himself
in favor of the line of Abbas; and had treated with indignity the
robe of honor which was presented by the Fatimite ambassador. Yet
the ungrateful Hashemite had changed with the change of fortune; he
applauded the victory of Zendecan, and named the Seljukian sultan
his temporal vicegerent over the Moslem world. As Togrul executed and
enlarged this important trust, he was called to the deliverance of the
caliph Cayem, and obeyed the holy summons, which gave a new kingdom to
his arms. <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> In the palace of Bagdad, the commander of the faithful
still slumbered, a venerable phantom. His servant or master, the prince
of the Bowides, could no longer protect him from the insolence of meaner
tyrants; and the Euphrates and Tigris were oppressed by the revolt of
the Turkish and Arabian emirs. The presence of a conqueror was implored
as a blessing; and the transient mischiefs of fire and sword were
excused as the sharp but salutary remedies which alone could restore the
health of the republic. At the head of an irresistible force, the sultan
of Persia marched from Hamadan: the proud were crushed, the prostrate
were spared; the prince of the Bowides disappeared; the heads of the
most obstinate rebels were laid at the feet of Togrul; and he inflicted
a lesson of obedience on the people of Mosul and Bagdad. After the
chastisement of the guilty, and the restoration of peace, the royal
shepherd accepted the reward of his labors; and a solemn comedy
represented the triumph of religious prejudice over Barbarian power.
<a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> The Turkish sultan embarked on the Tigris, landed at the gate of
Racca, and made his public entry on horseback. At the palace-gate he
respectfully dismounted, and walked on foot, preceded by his emirs
without arms. The caliph was seated behind his black veil: the black
garment of the Abbassides was cast over his shoulders, and he held in
his hand the staff of the apostle of God. The conqueror of the East
kissed the ground, stood some time in a modest posture, and was led
towards the throne by the vizier and interpreter. After Togrul had
seated himself on another throne, his commission was publicly read,
which declared him the temporal lieutenant of the vicar of the prophet.
He was successively invested with seven robes of honor, and presented
with seven slaves, the natives of the seven climates of the Arabian
empire. His mystic veil was perfumed with musk; two crowns <a href="#note-231" name="noteref-231"><small>231</small></a> were
placed on his head; two cimeters were girded to his side, as the symbols
of a double reign over the East and West. After this inauguration, the
sultan was prevented from prostrating himself a second time; but he
twice kissed the hand of the commander of the faithful, and his titles
were proclaimed by the voice of heralds and the applause of the Moslems.
In a second visit to Bagdad, the Seljukian prince again rescued the
caliph from his enemies and devoutly, on foot, led the bridle of his
mule from the prison to the palace. Their alliance was cemented by the
marriage of Togrul's sister with the successor of the prophet. Without
reluctance he had introduced a Turkish virgin into his harem; but Cayem
proudly refused his daughter to the sultan, disdained to mingle the
blood of the Hashemites with the blood of a Scythian shepherd; and
protracted the negotiation many months, till the gradual diminution of
his revenue admonished him that he was still in the hands of a master.
The royal nuptials were followed by the death of Togrul himself; <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a>
as he left no children, his nephew Alp Arslan succeeded to the title
and prerogatives of sultan; and his name, after that of the caliph, was
pronounced in the public prayers of the Moslems. Yet in this revolution,
the Abbassides acquired a larger measure of liberty and power. On the
throne of Asia, the Turkish monarchs were less jealous of the domestic
administration of Bagdad; and the commanders of the faithful were
relieved from the ignominious vexations to which they had been exposed
by the presence and poverty of the Persian dynasty.

<h2>
    Chapter LVII: The Turks.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
Since the fall of the caliphs, the discord and degeneracy of the
Saracens respected the Asiatic provinces of Rome; which, by the
victories of Nicephorus, Zimisces, and Basil, had been extended as far
as Antioch and the eastern boundaries of Armenia.
</p>
<p>
Twenty-five years after the death of Basil, his successors were suddenly
assaulted by an unknown race of Barbarians, who united the Scythian
valor with the fanaticism of new proselytes, and the art and riches of
a powerful monarchy. <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> The myriads of Turkish horse overspread a
frontier of six hundred miles from Tauris to Arzeroum, and the blood of
one hundred and thirty thousand Christians was a grateful sacrifice to
the Arabian prophet. Yet the arms of Togrul did not make any deep or
lasting impression on the Greek empire. The torrent rolled away from the
open country; the sultan retired without glory or success from the siege
of an Armenian city; the obscure hostilities were continued or suspended
with a vicissitude of events; and the bravery of the Macedonian legions
renewed the fame of the conqueror of Asia. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> The name of Alp Arslan,
the valiant lion, is expressive of the popular idea of the perfection of
man; and the successor of Togrul displayed the fierceness and generosity
of the royal animal. He passed the Euphrates at the head of the Turkish
cavalry, and entered Caesarea, the metropolis of Cappadocia, to which
he had been attracted by the fame and wealth of the temple of St. Basil.
The solid structure resisted the destroyer: but he carried away the
doors of the shrine incrusted with gold and pearls, and profaned the
relics of the tutelar saint, whose mortal frailties were now covered
by the venerable rust of antiquity. The final conquest of Armenia and
Georgia was achieved by Alp Arslan. In Armenia, the title of a
kingdom, and the spirit of a nation, were annihilated: the artificial
fortifications were yielded by the mercenaries of Constantinople; by
strangers without faith, veterans without pay or arms, and recruits
without experience or discipline. The loss of this important frontier
was the news of a day; and the Catholics were neither surprised nor
displeased, that a people so deeply infected with the Nestorian and
Eutychian errors had been delivered by Christ and his mother into the
hands of the infidels. <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> The woods and valleys of Mount Caucasus were
more strenuously defended by the native Georgians <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> or Iberians; but
the Turkish sultan and his son Malek were indefatigable in this holy
war: their captives were compelled to promise a spiritual, as well as
temporal, obedience; and, instead of their collars and bracelets, an
iron horseshoe, a badge of ignominy, was imposed on the infidels who
still adhered to the worship of their fathers. The change, however, was
not sincere or universal; and, through ages of servitude, the Georgians
have maintained the succession of their princes and bishops. But a race
of men, whom nature has cast in her most perfect mould, is degraded by
poverty, ignorance, and vice; their profession, and still more their
practice, of Christianity is an empty name; and if they have emerged
from heresy, it is only because they are too illiterate to remember a
metaphysical creed. <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a>

<p>
The false or genuine magnanimity of Mahmud the Gaznevide was not
imitated by Alp Arslan; and he attacked without scruple the Greek
empress Eudocia and her children. His alarming progress compelled her
to give herself and her sceptre to the hand of a soldier; and Romanus
Diogenes was invested with the Imperial purple. His patriotism, and
perhaps his pride, urged him from Constantinople within two months after
his accession; and the next campaign he most scandalously took the field
during the holy festival of Easter. In the palace, Diogenes was no more
than the husband of Eudocia: in the camp, he was the emperor of the
Romans, and he sustained that character with feeble resources and
invincible courage. By his spirit and success the soldiers were taught
to act, the subjects to hope, and the enemies to fear. The Turks
had penetrated into the heart of Phrygia; but the sultan himself had
resigned to his emirs the prosecution of the war; and their numerous
detachments were scattered over Asia in the security of conquest. Laden
with spoil, and careless of discipline, they were separately surprised
and defeated by the Greeks: the activity of the emperor seemed to
multiply his presence: and while they heard of his expedition to
Antioch, the enemy felt his sword on the hills of Trebizond. In three
laborious campaigns, the Turks were driven beyond the Euphrates; in
the fourth and last, Romanus undertook the deliverance of Armenia. The
desolation of the land obliged him to transport a supply of two months'
provisions; and he marched forwards to the siege of Malazkerd, <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> an
important fortress in the midway between the modern cities of Arzeroum
and Van. His army amounted, at the least, to one hundred thousand
men. The troops of Constantinople were reenforced by the disorderly
multitudes of Phrygia and Cappadocia; but the real strength was composed
of the subjects and allies of Europe, the legions of Macedonia, and the
squadrons of Bulgaria; the Uzi, a Moldavian horde, who were themselves
of the Turkish race; <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> and, above all, the mercenary and adventurous
bands of French and Normans. Their lances were commanded by the valiant
Ursel of Baliol, the kinsman or father of the Scottish kings, <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> and

</p>
<p>
On the report of this bold invasion, which threatened his hereditary
dominions, Alp Arslan flew to the scene of action at the head of forty
thousand horse. <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> His rapid and skilful evolutions distressed and
dismayed the superior numbers of the Greeks; and in the defeat of
Basilacius, one of their principal generals, he displayed the first
example of his valor and clemency. The imprudence of the emperor had
separated his forces after the reduction of Malazkerd. It was in vain
that he attempted to recall the mercenary Franks: they refused to obey
his summons; he disdained to await their return: the desertion of the
Uzi filled his mind with anxiety and suspicion; and against the most
salutary advice he rushed forwards to speedy and decisive action. Had he
listened to the fair proposals of the sultan, Romanus might have secured
a retreat, perhaps a peace; but in these overtures he supposed the fear
or weakness of the enemy, and his answer was conceived in the tone
of insult and defiance. "If the Barbarian wishes for peace, let him
evacuate the ground which he occupies for the encampment of the Romans,
and surrender his city and palace of Rei as a pledge of his sincerity."
Alp Arslan smiled at the vanity of the demand, but he wept the death of
so many faithful Moslems; and, after a devout prayer, proclaimed a free
permission to all who were desirous of retiring from the field. With his
own hands he tied up his horse's tail, exchanged his bow and arrows for
a mace and cimeter, clothed himself in a white garment, perfumed his
body with musk, and declared that if he were vanquished, that spot
should be the place of his burial. <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> The sultan himself had affected
to cast away his missile weapons: but his hopes of victory were placed
in the arrows of the Turkish cavalry, whose squadrons were loosely
distributed in the form of a crescent. Instead of the successive lines
and reserves of the Grecian tactics, Romulus led his army in a single
and solid phalanx, and pressed with vigor and impatience the artful and
yielding resistance of the Barbarians. In this desultory and fruitless
combat he spent the greater part of a summer's day, till prudence and
fatigue compelled him to return to his camp. But a retreat is always
perilous in the face of an active foe; and no sooner had the standard
been turned to the rear than the phalanx was broken by the base
cowardice, or the baser jealousy, of Andronicus, a rival prince, who
disgraced his birth and the purple of the Caesars. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> The Turkish
squadrons poured a cloud of arrows on this moment of confusion and
lassitude; and the horns of their formidable crescent were closed in the
rear of the Greeks. In the destruction of the army and pillage of
the camp, it would be needless to mention the number of the slain or
captives. The Byzantine writers deplore the loss of an inestimable
pearl: they forgot to mention, that in this fatal day the Asiatic
provinces of Rome were irretrievably sacrificed.

more explicitly of his treason.]
</p>
<p>
As long as a hope survived, Romanus attempted to rally and save the
relics of his army. When the centre, the Imperial station, was left
naked on all sides, and encompassed by the victorious Turks, he still,
with desperate courage, maintained the fight till the close of day, at
the head of the brave and faithful subjects who adhered to his standard.
They fell around him; his horse was slain; the emperor was wounded;
yet he stood alone and intrepid, till he was oppressed and bound by the
strength of multitudes. The glory of this illustrious prize was disputed
by a slave and a soldier; a slave who had seen him on the throne of
Constantinople, and a soldier whose extreme deformity had been excused
on the promise of some signal service.
</p>
<p>
Despoiled of his arms, his jewels, and his purple, Romanus spent a
dreary and perilous night on the field of battle, amidst a disorderly
crowd of the meaner Barbarians. In the morning the royal captive was
presented to Alp Arslan, who doubted of his fortune, till the identity
of the person was ascertained by the report of his ambassadors, and by
the more pathetic evidence of Basilacius, who embraced with tears
the feet of his unhappy sovereign. The successor of Constantine, in a
plebeian habit, was led into the Turkish divan, and commanded to kiss
the ground before the lord of Asia. He reluctantly obeyed; and Alp
Arslan, starting from his throne, is said to have planted his foot on
the neck of the Roman emperor. <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> But the fact is doubtful; and if, in
this moment of insolence, the sultan complied with the national custom,
the rest of his conduct has extorted the praise of his bigoted foes, and
may afford a lesson to the most civilized ages. He instantly raised the
royal captive from the ground; and thrice clasping his hand with tender
sympathy, assured him, that his life and dignity should be inviolate
in the hands of a prince who had learned to respect the majesty of his
equals and the vicissitudes of fortune. From the divan, Romanus was
conducted to an adjacent tent, where he was served with pomp and
reverence by the officers of the sultan, who, twice each day, seated
him in the place of honor at his own table. In a free and familiar
conversation of eight days, not a word, not a look, of insult escaped
from the conqueror; but he severely censured the unworthy subjects who
had deserted their valiant prince in the hour of danger, and gently
admonished his antagonist of some errors which he had committed in the
management of the war. In the preliminaries of negotiation, Alp
Arslan asked him what treatment he expected to receive, and the calm
indifference of the emperor displays the freedom of his mind. "If you
are cruel," said he, "you will take my life; if you listen to pride, you
will drag me at your chariot-wheels; if you consult your interest,
you will accept a ransom, and restore me to my country." "And what,"
continued the sultan, "would have been your own behavior, had fortune
smiled on your arms?" The reply of the Greek betrays a sentiment, which
prudence, and even gratitude, should have taught him to suppress. "Had I
vanquished," he fiercely said, "I would have inflicted on thy body many
a stripe." The Turkish conqueror smiled at the insolence of his captive
observed that the Christian law inculcated the love of enemies and
forgiveness of injuries; and nobly declared, that he would not imitate
an example which he condemned. After mature deliberation, Alp Arslan
dictated the terms of liberty and peace, a ransom of a million, <a href="#note-361" name="noteref-361"><small>361</small></a> an
annual tribute of three hundred and sixty thousand pieces of gold,
<a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> the marriage of the royal children, and the deliverance of all
the Moslems, who were in the power of the Greeks. Romanus, with a sigh,
subscribed this treaty, so disgraceful to the majesty of the empire; he
was immediately invested with a Turkish robe of honor; his nobles and
patricians were restored to their sovereign; and the sultan, after
a courteous embrace, dismissed him with rich presents and a military
guard. No sooner did he reach the confines of the empire, than he was
informed that the palace and provinces had disclaimed their allegiance
to a captive: a sum of two hundred thousand pieces was painfully
collected; and the fallen monarch transmitted this part of his ransom,
with a sad confession of his impotence and disgrace. The generosity, or
perhaps the ambition, of the sultan, prepared to espouse the cause of
his ally; but his designs were prevented by the defeat, imprisonment,
and death, of Romanus Diogenes. <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a>

<p>
In the treaty of peace, it does not appear that Alp Arslan extorted any
province or city from the captive emperor; and his revenge was satisfied
with the trophies of his victory, and the spoils of Anatolia, from
Antioch to the Black Sea. The fairest part of Asia was subject to his
laws: twelve hundred princes, or the sons of princes, stood before his
throne; and two hundred thousand soldiers marched under his banners.
The sultan disdained to pursue the fugitive Greeks; but he meditated the
more glorious conquest of Turkestan, the original seat of the house
of Seljuk. He moved from Bagdad to the banks of the Oxus; a bridge was
thrown over the river; and twenty days were consumed in the passage
of his troops. But the progress of the great king was retarded by the
governor of Berzem; and Joseph the Carizmian presumed to defend his
fortress against the powers of the East. When he was produced a captive
in the royal tent, the sultan, instead of praising his valor, severely
reproached his obstinate folly: and the insolent replies of the rebel
provoked a sentence, that he should be fastened to four stakes, and
left to expire in that painful situation. At this command, the desperate
Carizmian, drawing a dagger, rushed headlong towards the throne: the
guards raised their battle-axes; their zeal was checked by Alp Arslan,
the most skilful archer of the age: he drew his bow, but his foot
slipped, the arrow glanced aside, and he received in his breast the
dagger of Joseph, who was instantly cut in pieces.
</p>
<p>
The wound was mortal; and the Turkish prince bequeathed a dying
admonition to the pride of kings. "In my youth," said Alp Arslan, "I
was advised by a sage to humble myself before God; to distrust my
own strength; and never to despise the most contemptible foe. I have
neglected these lessons; and my neglect has been deservedly punished.
Yesterday, as from an eminence I beheld the numbers, the discipline, and
the spirit, of my armies, the earth seemed to tremble under my feet; and
I said in my heart, Surely thou art the king of the world, the greatest
and most invincible of warriors. These armies are no longer mine; and,
in the confidence of my personal strength, I now fall by the hand of
an assassin." <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> Alp Arslan possessed the virtues of a Turk and a
Mussulman; his voice and stature commanded the reverence of mankind; his
face was shaded with long whiskers; and his ample turban was fashioned
in the shape of a crown. The remains of the sultan were deposited in the
tomb of the Seljukian dynasty; and the passenger might read and meditate
this useful inscription: <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> "O ye who have seen the glory of Alp
Arslan exalted to the heavens, repair to Maru, and you will behold it
buried in the dust." The annihilation of the inscription, and the tomb
itself, more forcibly proclaims the instability of human greatness.

<p>
During the life of Alp Arslan, his eldest son had been acknowledged as
the future sultan of the Turks. On his father's death the inheritance
was disputed by an uncle, a cousin, and a brother: they drew their
cimeters, and assembled their followers; and the triple victory of Malek
Shah <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> established his own reputation and the right of primogeniture.
In every age, and more especially in Asia, the thirst of power has
inspired the same passions, and occasioned the same disorders; but,
from the long series of civil war, it would not be easy to extract a
sentiment more pure and magnanimous than is contained in the saying of
the Turkish prince. On the eve of the battle, he performed his devotions
at Thous, before the tomb of the Imam Riza. As the sultan rose from the
ground, he asked his vizier Nizam, who had knelt beside him, what had
been the object of his secret petition: "That your arms may be crowned
with victory," was the prudent, and most probably the sincere, answer of
the minister. "For my part," replied the generous Malek, "I implored
the Lord of Hosts that he would take from me my life and crown, if
my brother be more worthy than myself to reign over the Moslems." The
favorable judgment of heaven was ratified by the caliph; and for
the first time, the sacred title of Commander of the Faithful was
communicated to a Barbarian. But this Barbarian, by his personal merit,
and the extent of his empire, was the greatest prince of his age.
After the settlement of Persia and Syria, he marched at the head of
innumerable armies to achieve the conquest of Turkestan, which had been
undertaken by his father. In his passage of the Oxus, the boatmen, who
had been employed in transporting some troops, complained, that their
payment was assigned on the revenues of Antioch. The sultan frowned at
this preposterous choice; but he miled at the artful flattery of his
vizier. "It was not to postpone their reward, that I selected those
remote places, but to leave a memorial to posterity, that, under your
reign, Antioch and the Oxus were subject to the same sovereign." But
this description of his limits was unjust and parsimonious: beyond the
Oxus, he reduced to his obedience the cities of Bochara, Carizme, and
Samarcand, and crushed each rebellious slave, or independent savage, who
dared to resist. Malek passed the Sihon or Jaxartes, the last boundary
of Persian civilization: the hordes of Turkestan yielded to his
supremacy: his name was inserted on the coins, and in the prayers of
Cashgar, a Tartar kingdom on the extreme borders of China. From the
Chinese frontier, he stretched his immediate jurisdiction or feudatory
sway to the west and south, as far as the mountains of Georgia, the
neighborhood of Constantinople, the holy city of Jerusalem, and the
spicy groves of Arabia Felix. Instead of resigning himself to the luxury
of his harem, the shepherd king, both in peace and war, was in action
and in the field. By the perpetual motion of the royal camp, each
province was successively blessed with his presence; and he is said to
have perambulated twelve times the wide extent of his dominions,
which surpassed the Asiatic reign of Cyrus and the caliphs. Of these
expeditions, the most pious and splendid was the pilgrimage of Mecca:
the freedom and safety of the caravans were protected by his arms; the
citizens and pilgrims were enriched by the profusion of his alms; and
the desert was cheered by the places of relief and refreshment, which
he instituted for the use of his brethren. Hunting was the pleasure, and
even the passion, of the sultan, and his train consisted of forty-seven
thousand horses; but after the massacre of a Turkish chase, for each
piece of game, he bestowed a piece of gold on the poor, a slight
atonement, at the expense of the people, for the cost and mischief of
the amusement of kings. In the peaceful prosperity of his reign, the
cities of Asia were adorned with palaces and hospitals with moschs and
colleges; few departed from his Divan without reward, and none without
justice. The language and literature of Persia revived under the house
of Seljuk; <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> and if Malek emulated the liberality of a Turk less
potent than himself, <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> his palace might resound with the songs of a
hundred poets. The sultan bestowed a more serious and learned care
on the reformation of the calendar, which was effected by a general
assembly of the astronomers of the East. By a law of the prophet, the
Moslems are confined to the irregular course of the lunar months; in
Persia, since the age of Zoroaster, the revolution of the sun has been
known and celebrated as an annual festival; <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> but after the fall of
the Magian empire, the intercalation had been neglected; the fractions
of minutes and hours were multiplied into days; and the date of the
springs was removed from the sign of Aries to that of Pisces. The reign
of Malek was illustrated by the Gelalaean aera; and all errors, either
past or future, were corrected by a computation of time, which surpasses
the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian, style. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a>

In a period when Europe was plunged in the deepest barbarism, the light
and splendor of Asia may be ascribed to the docility rather than the
knowledge of the Turkish conquerors. An ample share of their wisdom and
virtue is due to a Persian vizier, who ruled the empire under the reigns
of Alp Arslan and his son. Nizam, one of the most illustrious ministers
of the East, was honored by the caliph as an oracle of religion and
science; he was trusted by the sultan as the faithful vicegerent of his
power and justice. After an administration of thirty years, the fame
of the vizier, his wealth, and even his services, were transformed into
crimes. He was overthrown by the insidious arts of a woman and a rival;
and his fall was hastened by a rash declaration, that his cap and
ink-horn, the badges of his office, were connected by the divine decree
with the throne and diadem of the sultan. At the age of ninety-three
years, the venerable statesman was dismissed by his master, accused by
his enemies, and murdered by a fanatic: <a href="#note-451" name="noteref-451"><small>451</small></a> the last words of Nizam
attested his innocence, and the remainder of Malek's life was short and
inglorious. From Ispahan, the scene of this disgraceful transaction, the
sultan moved to Bagdad, with the design of transplanting the caliph,
and of fixing his own residence in the capital of the Moslem world. The
feeble successor of Mahomet obtained a respite of ten days; and before
the expiration of the term, the Barbarian was summoned by the angel of
death. His ambassadors at Constantinople had asked in marriage a Roman
princess; but the proposal was decently eluded; and the daughter
of Alexius, who might herself have been the victim, expresses her
abhorrence of his unnatural conjunction. <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> The daughter of the sultan
was bestowed on the caliph Moctadi, with the imperious condition, that,
renouncing the society of his wives and concubines, he should forever
confine himself to this honorable alliance.

    Chapter LVII: The Turks.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
The greatness and unity of the Turkish empire expired in the person of
Malek Shah. His vacant throne was disputed by his brother and his
four sons; <a href="#note-461" name="noteref-461"><small>461</small></a> and, after a series of civil wars, the treaty which
reconciled the surviving candidates confirmed a lasting separation in
the Persian dynasty, the eldest and principal branch of the house of
Seljuk. The three younger dynasties were those of Kerman, of Syria, and
of Roum: the first of these commanded an extensive, though obscure, <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a>
dominion on the shores of the Indian Ocean: <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> the second expelled
the Arabian princes of Aleppo and Damascus; and the third, our peculiar
care, invaded the Roman provinces of Asia Minor. The generous policy
of Malek contributed to their elevation: he allowed the princes of
his blood, even those whom he had vanquished in the field, to seek
new kingdoms worthy of their ambition; nor was he displeased that they
should draw away the more ardent spirits, who might have disturbed the
tranquillity of his reign. As the supreme head of his family and nation,
the great sultan of Persia commanded the obedience and tribute of his
royal brethren: the thrones of Kerman and Nice, of Aleppo and Damascus;
the Atabeks, and emirs of Syria and Mesopotamia, erected their standards
under the shadow of his sceptre: <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> and the hordes of Turkmans
overspread the plains of the Western Asia.
</p>
<p>
After the death of Malek, the bands of union and subordination were
relaxed and finally dissolved: the indulgence of the house of Seljuk
invested their slaves with the inheritance of kingdoms; and, in the
Oriental style, a crowd of princes arose from the dust of their feet.

A prince of the royal line, Cutulmish, <a href="#note-501" name="noteref-501"><small>501</small></a> the son of Izrail, the
son of Seljuk, had fallen in a battle against Alp Arslan and the humane
victor had dropped a tear over his grave. His five sons, strong in arms,
ambitious of power, and eager for revenge, unsheathed their cimeters
against the son of Alp Arslan. The two armies expected the signal when
the caliph, forgetful of the majesty which secluded him from vulgar
eyes, interposed his venerable mediation. "Instead of shedding the blood
of your brethren, your brethren both in descent and faith, unite your
forces in a holy war against the Greeks, the enemies of God and his
apostle." They listened to his voice; the sultan embraced his rebellious
kinsmen; and the eldest, the valiant Soliman, accepted the royal
standard, which gave him the free conquest and hereditary command of the
provinces of the Roman empire, from Arzeroum to Constantinople, and the
unknown regions of the West. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> Accompanied by his four brothers,
he passed the Euphrates; the Turkish camp was soon seated in the
neighborhood of Kutaieh in Phrygia; and his flying cavalry laid waste
the country as far as the Hellespont and the Black Sea. Since the
decline of the empire, the peninsula of Asia Minor had been exposed to
the transient, though destructive, inroads of the Persians and Saracens;
but the fruits of a lasting conquest were reserved for the Turkish
sultan; and his arms were introduced by the Greeks, who aspired to reign
on the ruins of their country. Since the captivity of Romanus, six years
the feeble son of Eudocia had trembled under the weight of the Imperial
crown, till the provinces of the East and West were lost in the same
month by a double rebellion: of either chief Nicephorus was the common
name; but the surnames of Bryennius and Botoniates distinguish the
European and Asiatic candidates. Their reasons, or rather their
promises, were weighed in the Divan; and, after some hesitation, Soliman
declared himself in favor of Botoniates, opened a free passage to his
troops in their march from Antioch to Nice, and joined the banner of the
Crescent to that of the Cross. After his ally had ascended the throne of
Constantinople, the sultan was hospitably entertained in the suburb of
Chrysopolis or Scutari; and a body of two thousand Turks was transported
into Europe, to whose dexterity and courage the new emperor was indebted
for the defeat and captivity of his rival, Bryennius. But the conquest
of Europe was dearly purchased by the sacrifice of Asia: Constantinople
was deprived of the obedience and revenue of the provinces beyond the
Bosphorus and Hellespont; and the regular progress of the Turks, who
fortified the passes of the rivers and mountains, left not a hope of
their retreat or expulsion. Another candidate implored the aid of the
sultan: Melissenus, in his purple robes and red buskins, attended the
motions of the Turkish camp; and the desponding cities were tempted by
the summons of a Roman prince, who immediately surrendered them into the
hands of the Barbarians. These acquisitions were confirmed by a treaty
of peace with the emperor Alexius: his fear of Robert compelled him to
seek the friendship of Soliman; and it was not till after the sultan's
death that he extended as far as Nicomedia, about sixty miles from
Constantinople, the eastern boundary of the Roman world. Trebizond
alone, defended on either side by the sea and mountains, preserved at
the extremity of the Euxine the ancient character of a Greek colony, and
the future destiny of a Christian empire.

Since the first conquests of the caliphs, the establishment of the Turks
in Anatolia or Asia Minor was the most deplorable loss which the church
and empire had sustained. By the propagation of the Moslem faith,
Soliman deserved the name of Gazi, a holy champion; and his new
kingdoms, of the Romans, or of Roum, was added to the tables of
Oriental geography. It is described as extending from the Euphrates to
Constantinople, from the Black Sea to the confines of Syria; pregnant
with mines of silver and iron, of alum and copper, fruitful in corn and
wine, and productive of cattle and excellent horses. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> The wealth of
Lydia, the arts of the Greeks, the splendor of the Augustan age, existed
only in books and ruins, which were equally obscure in the eyes of the
Scythian conquerors. Yet, in the present decay, Anatolia still contains
some wealthy and populous cities; and, under the Byzantine empire, they
were far more flourishing in numbers, size, and opulence. By the choice
of the sultan, Nice, the metropolis of Bithynia, was preferred for
his palace and fortress: the seat of the Seljukian dynasty of Roum
was planted one hundred miles from Constantinople; and the divinity of
Christ was denied and derided in the same temple in which it had been
pronounced by the first general synod of the Catholics. The unity
of God, and the mission of Mahomet, were preached in the moschs; the
Arabian learning was taught in the schools; the Cadhis judged according
to the law of the Koran; the Turkish manners and language prevailed
in the cities; and Turkman camps were scattered over the plains and
mountains of Anatolia. On the hard conditions of tribute and servitude,
the Greek Christians might enjoy the exercise of their religion; but
their most holy churches were profaned; their priests and bishops were
insulted; <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> they were compelled to suffer the triumph of the Pagans,
and the apostasy of their brethren; many thousand children were marked
by the knife of circumcision; and many thousand captives were devoted
to the service or the pleasures of their masters. <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> After the loss
of Asia, Antioch still maintained her primitive allegiance to Christ and
Caesar; but the solitary province was separated from all Roman aid,
and surrounded on all sides by the Mahometan powers. The despair of
Philaretus the governor prepared the sacrifice of his religion and
loyalty, had not his guilt been prevented by his son, who hastened to
the Nicene palace, and offered to deliver this valuable prize into the
hands of Soliman. The ambitious sultan mounted on horseback, and in
twelve nights (for he reposed in the day) performed a march of six
hundred miles. Antioch was oppressed by the speed and secrecy of
his enterprise; and the dependent cities, as far as Laodicea and the
confines of Aleppo, <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> obeyed the example of the metropolis. From
Laodicea to the Thracian Bosphorus, or arm of St. George, the conquests
and reign of Soliman extended thirty days' journey in length, and in
breadth about ten or fifteen, between the rocks of Lycia and the Black
Sea. <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> The Turkish ignorance of navigation protected, for a while,
the inglorious safety of the emperor; but no sooner had a fleet of two
hundred ships been constructed by the hands of the captive Greeks, than
Alexius trembled behind the walls of his capital. His plaintive epistles
were dispersed over Europe, to excite the compassion of the Latins,
and to paint the danger, the weakness, and the riches of the city of
Constantine. <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a>

But the most interesting conquest of the Seljukian Turks was that of
Jerusalem, <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> which soon became the theatre of nations. In their
capitulation with Omar, the inhabitants had stipulated the assurance
of their religion and property; but the articles were interpreted by a
master against whom it was dangerous to dispute; and in the four hundred
years of the reign of the caliphs, the political climate of Jerusalem
was exposed to the vicissitudes of storm and sunshine. <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> By the
increase of proselytes and population, the Mahometans might excuse the
usurpation of three fourths of the city: but a peculiar quarter was
resolved for the patriarch with his clergy and people; a tribute of two
pieces of gold was the price of protection; and the sepulchre of Christ,
with the church of the Resurrection, was still left in the hands of his
votaries. Of these votaries, the most numerous and respectable portion
were strangers to Jerusalem: the pilgrimages to the Holy Land had been
stimulated, rather than suppressed, by the conquest of the Arabs; and
the enthusiasm which had always prompted these perilous journeys, was
nourished by the congenial passions of grief and indignation. A crowd of
pilgrims from the East and West continued to visit the holy sepulchre,
and the adjacent sanctuaries, more especially at the festival of Easter;
and the Greeks and Latins, the Nestorians and Jacobites, the Copts and
Abyssinians, the Armenians and Georgians, maintained the chapels, the
clergy, and the poor of their respective communions. The harmony of
prayer in so many various tongues, the worship of so many nations in
the common temple of their religion, might have afforded a spectacle
of edification and peace; but the zeal of the Christian sects was
imbittered by hatred and revenge; and in the kingdom of a suffering
Messiah, who had pardoned his enemies, they aspired to command and
persecute their spiritual brethren. The preeminence was asserted by the
spirit and numbers of the Franks; and the greatness of Charlemagne <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a>
protected both the Latin pilgrims and the Catholics of the East. The
poverty of Carthage, Alexandria, and Jerusalem, was relieved by the alms
of that pious emperor; and many monasteries of Palestine were founded
or restored by his liberal devotion. Harun Alrashid, the greatest of
the Abbassides, esteemed in his Christian brother a similar supremacy
of genius and power: their friendship was cemented by a frequent
intercourse of gifts and embassies; and the caliph, without resigning
the substantial dominion, presented the emperor with the keys of the
holy sepulchre, and perhaps of the city of Jerusalem. In the decline of
the Carlovingian monarchy, the republic of Amalphi promoted the interest
of trade and religion in the East. Her vessels transported the Latin
pilgrims to the coasts of Egypt and Palestine, and deserved, by their
useful imports, the favor and alliance of the Fatimite caliphs: <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> an
annual fair was instituted on Mount Calvary: and the Italian merchants
founded the convent and hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, the cradle of
the monastic and military order, which has since reigned in the isles of
Rhodes and of Malta. Had the Christian pilgrims been content to revere
the tomb of a prophet, the disciples of Mahomet, instead of blaming,
would have imitated, their piety: but these rigid Unitarians were
scandalized by a worship which represents the birth, death, and
resurrection, of a God; the Catholic images were branded with the name
of idols; and the Moslems smiled with indignation <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> at the miraculous
flame which was kindled on the eve of Easter in the holy sepulchre. <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a>
This pious fraud, first devised in the ninth century, <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> was devoutly
cherished by the Latin crusaders, and is annually repeated by the
clergy of the Greek, Armenian, and Coptic sects, <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> who impose on
the credulous spectators <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> for their own benefit, and that of their
tyrants. In every age, a principle of toleration has been fortified by
a sense of interest: and the revenue of the prince and his emir was
increased each year, by the expense and tribute of so many thousand
strangers.

The revolution which transferred the sceptre from the Abbassides to
the Fatimites was a benefit, rather than an injury, to the Holy Land.
A sovereign resident in Egypt was more sensible of the importance of
Christian trade; and the emirs of Palestine were less remote from the
justice and power of the throne. But the third of these Fatimite caliphs
was the famous Hakem, <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> a frantic youth, who was delivered by his
impiety and despotism from the fear either of God or man; and whose
reign was a wild mixture of vice and folly. Regardless of the
most ancient customs of Egypt, he imposed on the women an absolute
confinement; the restraint excited the clamors of both sexes; their
clamors provoked his fury; a part of Old Cairo was delivered to the
flames and the guards and citizens were engaged many days in a bloody
conflict. At first the caliph declared himself a zealous Mussulman, the
founder or benefactor of moschs and colleges: twelve hundred and ninety
copies of the Koran were transcribed at his expense in letters of gold;
and his edict extirpated the vineyards of the Upper Egypt. But his
vanity was soon flattered by the hope of introducing a new religion;
he aspired above the fame of a prophet, and styled himself the visible
image of the Most High God, who, after nine apparitions on earth, was at
length manifest in his royal person. At the name of Hakem, the lord of
the living and the dead, every knee was bent in religious adoration:
his mysteries were performed on a mountain near Cairo: sixteen thousand
converts had signed his profession of faith; and at the present hour, a
free and warlike people, the Druses of Mount Libanus, are persuaded
of the life and divinity of a madman and tyrant. <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> In his divine
character, Hakem hated the Jews and Christians, as the servants of his
rivals; while some remains of prejudice or prudence still pleaded in
favor of the law of Mahomet. Both in Egypt and Palestine, his cruel
and wanton persecution made some martyrs and many apostles: the common
rights and special privileges of the sectaries were equally disregarded;
and a general interdict was laid on the devotion of strangers
and natives. The temple of the Christian world, the church of the
Resurrection, was demolished to its foundations; the luminous prodigy of
Easter was interrupted, and much profane labor was exhausted to destroy
the cave in the rock which properly constitutes the holy sepulchre. At
the report of this sacrilege, the nations of Europe were astonished and
afflicted: but instead of arming in the defence of the Holy Land, they
contented themselves with burning, or banishing, the Jews, as the secret
advisers of the impious Barbarian. <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> Yet the calamities of Jerusalem
were in some measure alleviated by the inconstancy or repentance of
Hakem himself; and the royal mandate was sealed for the restitution of
the churches, when the tyrant was assassinated by the emissaries of
his sister. The succeeding caliphs resumed the maxims of religion and
policy: a free toleration was again granted; with the pious aid of the
emperor of Constantinople, the holy sepulchre arose from its ruins;
and, after a short abstinence, the pilgrims returned with an increase
of appetite to the spiritual feast. <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> In the sea-voyage of Palestine,
the dangers were frequent, and the opportunities rare: but the
conversion of Hungary opened a safe communication between Germany and
Greece. The charity of St. Stephen, the apostle of his kingdom, relieved
and conducted his itinerant brethren; <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> and from Belgrade to Antioch,
they traversed fifteen hundred miles of a Christian empire. Among the
Franks, the zeal of pilgrimage prevailed beyond the example of former
times: and the roads were covered with multitudes of either sex, and of
every rank, who professed their contempt of life, so soon as they should
have kissed the tomb of their Redeemer. Princes and prelates abandoned
the care of their dominions; and the numbers of these pious caravans
were a prelude to the armies which marched in the ensuing age under the
banner of the cross. About thirty years before the first crusade,
the arch bishop of Mentz, with the bishops of Utrecht, Bamberg, and
Ratisbon, undertook this laborious journey from the Rhine to the Jordan;
and the multitude of their followers amounted to seven thousand persons.
At Constantinople, they were hospitably entertained by the emperor; but
the ostentation of their wealth provoked the assault of the wild Arabs:
they drew their swords with scrupulous reluctance, and sustained
siege in the village of Capernaum, till they were rescued by the venal
protection of the Fatimite emir. After visiting the holy places, they
embarked for Italy, but only a remnant of two thousand arrived in safety
in their native land.

back. <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a>

[ The religion of the Druses is concealed by their ignorance
and hypocrisy. Their secret doctrines are confined to the elect
who profess a contemplative life; and the vulgar Druses, the most
indifferent of men, occasionally conform to the worship of the
Mahometans and Christians of their neighborhood. The little that is, or
deserves to be, known, may be seen in the industrious Niebuhr,
(Voyages, tom. ii. p. 354-357,) and the second volume of the recent and
instructive Travels of M. de Volney. * Note: The religion of the Druses
has, within the present year, been fully developed from their own
writings, which have long lain neglected in the libraries of Paris and
Oxford, in the "Expose de la Religion des Druses, by M. Silvestre de
Sacy." Deux tomes, Paris, 1838. The learned author has prefixed a life
of Hakem Biamr-Allah, which enables us to correct several errors in the
account of Gibbon. These errors chiefly arose from his want of knowledge
or of attention to the chronology of Hakem's life. Hakem succeeded to
the throne of Egypt in the year of the Hegira 386. He did not assume
his divinity till 408. His life was indeed "a wild mixture of vice and
folly," to which may be added, of the most sanguinary cruelty. During
his reign, 18,000 persons were victims of his ferocity. Yet such is the
god, observes M. de Sacy, whom the Druses have worshipped for 800 years!
(See p. ccccxxix.) All his wildest and most extravagant actions were
interpreted by his followers as having a mystic and allegoric meaning,
alluding to the destruction of other religions and the propagation
of his own. It does not seem to have been the "vanity" of Hakem which
induced him to introduce a new religion. The curious point in the new
faith is that Hamza, the son of Ali, the real founder of the Unitarian
religion, (such is its boastful title,) was content to take a secondary
part. While Hakem was God, the one Supreme, the Imam Hamza was his
Intelligence. It was not in his "divine character" that Hakem "hated
the Jews and Christians," but in that of a Mahometan bigot, which he
displayed in the earlier years of his reign. His barbarous persecution,
and the burning of the church of the Resurrection at Jerusalem, belong
entirely to that period; and his assumption of divinity was followed
by an edict of toleration to Jews and Christians. The Mahometans, whose
religion he then treated with hostility and contempt, being far the most
numerous, were his most dangerous enemies, and therefore the objects of
his most inveterate hatred. It is another singular fact, that the
religion of Hakem was by no means confined to Egypt and Syria. M. de
Sacy quotes a letter addressed to the chief of the sect in India; and
there is likewise a letter to the Byzantine emperor Constantine, son of
Armanous, (Romanus,) and the clergy of the empire. (Constantine VIII.,
M. de Sacy supposes, but this is irreconcilable with chronology; it must
mean Constantine XI., Monomachus.) The assassination of Hakem is, of
course, disbelieved by his sectaries. M. de Sacy seems to consider the
fact obscure and doubtful. According to his followers he disappeared,
but is hereafter to return. At his return the resurrection is to take
place; the triumph of Unitarianism, and the final discomfiture of all
other religions. The temple of Mecca is especially devoted to
destruction. It is remarkable that one of the signs of this final
consummation, and of the reappearance of Hakem, is that Christianity
shall be gaining a manifest predominance over Mahometanism. As for the
religion of the Druses, I cannot agree with Gibbon that it does not
"deserve" to be better known; and am grateful to M. de Sacy,
notwithstanding the prolixity and occasional repetition in his two large
volumes, for the full examination of the most extraordinary religious
aberration which ever extensively affected the mind of man. The worship
of a mad tyrant is the basis of a subtle metaphysical creed, and of a
severe, and even ascetic, morality.&mdash;M.]

After the defeat of the Romans, the tranquillity of the Fatimite caliphs
was invaded by the Turks. <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> One of the lieutenants of Malek Shah,
Atsiz the Carizmian, marched into Syria at the head of a powerful army,
and reduced Damascus by famine and the sword. Hems, and the other cities
of the province, acknowledged the caliph of Bagdad and the sultan of
Persia; and the victorious emir advanced without resistance to the banks
of the Nile: the Fatimite was preparing to fly into the heart of
Africa; but the negroes of his guard and the inhabitants of Cairo made
a desperate sally, and repulsed the Turk from the confines of Egypt. In
his retreat he indulged the license of slaughter and rapine: the judge
and notaries of Jerusalem were invited to his camp; and their execution
was followed by the massacre of three thousand citizens. The cruelty or
the defeat of Atsiz was soon punished by the sultan Toucush, the brother
of Malek Shah, who, with a higher title and more formidable powers,
asserted the dominion of Syria and Palestine. The house of Seljuk
reigned about twenty years in Jerusalem; <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> but the hereditary command
of the holy city and territory was intrusted or abandoned to the emir
Ortok, the chief of a tribe of Turkmans, whose children, after their
expulsion from Palestine, formed two dynasties on the borders of
Armenia and Assyria. <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> The Oriental Christians and the Latin pilgrims
deplored a revolution, which, instead of the regular government and old
alliance of the caliphs, imposed on their necks the iron yoke of the
strangers of the North. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a> In his court and camp the great sultan had
adopted in some degree the arts and manners of Persia; but the body
of the Turkish nation, and more especially the pastoral tribes, still
breathed the fierceness of the desert. From Nice to Jerusalem,
the western countries of Asia were a scene of foreign and domestic
hostility; and the shepherds of Palestine, who held a precarious sway on
a doubtful frontier, had neither leisure nor capacity to await the slow
profits of commercial and religious freedom. The pilgrims, who, through
innumerable perils, had reached the gates of Jerusalem, were the
victims of private rapine or public oppression, and often sunk under the
pressure of famine and disease, before they were permitted to salute the
holy sepulchre. A spirit of native barbarism, or recent zeal, prompted
the Turkmans to insult the clergy of every sect: the patriarch was
dragged by the hair along the pavement, and cast into a dungeon, to
extort a ransom from the sympathy of his flock; and the divine worship
in the church of the Resurrection was often disturbed by the savage
rudeness of its masters. The pathetic tale excited the millions of the
West to march under the standard of the cross to the relief of the Holy
Land; and yet how trifling is the sum of these accumulated evils, if
compared with the single act of the sacrilege of Hakem, which had been
so patiently endured by the Latin Christians! A slighter provocation
inflamed the more irascible temper of their descendants: a new spirit
had arisen of religious chivalry and papal dominion; a nerve was touched
of exquisite feeling; and the sensation vibrated to the heart of Europe.

[ From the expedition of Isar Atsiz, (A. H. 469, A.D. 1076,)
to the expulsion of the Ortokides, (A.D. 1096.) Yet William of Tyre (l.
i. c. 6, p. 633) asserts, that Jerusalem was thirty-eight years in the
hands of the Turks; and an Arabic chronicle, quoted by Pagi, (tom. iv.
p. 202) supposes that the city was reduced by a Carizmian general to
the obedience of the caliph of Bagdad, A. H. 463, A.D. 1070. These early
dates are not very compatible with the general history of Asia; and I am
sure, that as late as A.D. 1064, the regnum Babylonicum (of Cairo) still
prevailed in Palestine, (Baronius, A.D. 1064, No. 56.)]
