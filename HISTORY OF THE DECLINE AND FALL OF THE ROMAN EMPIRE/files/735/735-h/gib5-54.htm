In the profession of Christianity, the variety of national characters
may be clearly distinguished. The natives of Syria and Egypt abandoned
their lives to lazy and contemplative devotion: Rome again aspired to
the dominion of the world; and the wit of the lively and loquacious
Greeks was consumed in the disputes of metaphysical theology. The
incomprehensible mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation, instead
of commanding their silent submission, were agitated in vehement and
subtile controversies, which enlarged their faith at the expense,
perhaps, of their charity and reason. From the council of Nice to
the end of the seventh century, the peace and unity of the church was
invaded by these spiritual wars; and so deeply did they affect the
decline and fall of the empire, that the historian has too often been
compelled to attend the synods, to explore the creeds, and to enumerate
the sects, of this busy period of ecclesiastical annals. From the
beginning of the eighth century to the last ages of the Byzantine
empire, the sound of controversy was seldom heard: curiosity was
exhausted, zeal was fatigued, and, in the decrees of six councils, the
articles of the Catholic faith had been irrevocably defined. The spirit
of dispute, however vain and pernicious, requires some energy and
exercise of the mental faculties; and the prostrate Greeks were content
to fast, to pray, and to believe in blind obedience to the patriarch
and his clergy. During a long dream of superstition, the Virgin and
the Saints, their visions and miracles, their relics and images, were
preached by the monks, and worshipped by the people; and the appellation
of people might be extended, without injustice, to the first ranks
of civil society. At an unseasonable moment, the Isaurian emperors
attempted somewhat rudely to awaken their subjects: under their
influence reason might obtain some proselytes, a far greater number was
swayed by interest or fear; but the Eastern world embraced or deplored
their visible deities, and the restoration of images was celebrated
as the feast of orthodoxy. In this passive and unanimous state the
ecclesiastical rulers were relieved from the toil, or deprived of the
pleasure, of persecution. The Pagans had disappeared; the Jews were
silent and obscure; the disputes with the Latins were rare and remote
hostilities against a national enemy; and the sects of Egypt and Syria
enjoyed a free toleration under the shadow of the Arabian caliphs. About
the middle of the seventh century, a branch of Manichaeans was selected
as the victims of spiritual tyranny; their patience was at length
exasperated to despair and rebellion; and their exile has scattered over
the West the seeds of reformation. These important events will justify
some inquiry into the doctrine and story of the Paulicians; <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> and, as
they cannot plead for themselves, our candid criticism will magnify
the good, and abate or suspect the evil, that is reported by their
adversaries.

[ The errors and virtues of the Paulicians are weighed,
with his usual judgment and candor, by the learned Mosheim, (Hist.
Ecclesiast. seculum ix. p. 311, &amp;c.) He draws his original intelligence
from Photius (contra Manichaeos, l. i.) and Peter Siculus, (Hist.
Manichaeorum.) The first of these accounts has not fallen into my
hands; the second, which Mosheim prefers, I have read in a Latin version
inserted in the Maxima Bibliotheca Patrum, (tom. xvi. p. 754-764,) from
the edition of the Jesuit Raderus, (Ingolstadii, 1604, in 4to.) * Note:
Compare Hallam's Middle Ages, p. 461-471. Mr. Hallam justly observes
that this chapter "appears to be accurate as well as luminous, and is at
least far superior to any modern work on the subject."&mdash;M.]

The Gnostics, who had distracted the infancy, were oppressed by
the greatness and authority, of the church. Instead of emulating or
surpassing the wealth, learning, and numbers of the Catholics, their
obscure remnant was driven from the capitals of the East and West,
and confined to the villages and mountains along the borders of the
Euphrates. Some vestige of the Marcionites may be detected in the fifth
century; <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> but the numerous sects were finally lost in the odious name
of the Manichaeans; and these heretics, who presumed to reconcile the
doctrines of Zoroaster and Christ, were pursued by the two religions
with equal and unrelenting hatred. Under the grandson of Heraclius, in
the neighborhood of Samosata, more famous for the birth of Lucian than
for the title of a Syrian kingdom, a reformer arose, esteemed by the
Paulicians as the chosen messenger of truth. In his humble dwelling of
Mananalis, Constantine entertained a deacon, who returned from Syrian
captivity, and received the inestimable gift of the New Testament, which
was already concealed from the vulgar by the prudence of the Greek, and
perhaps of the Gnostic, clergy. <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> These books became the measure of
his studies and the rule of his faith; and the Catholics, who dispute
his interpretation, acknowledge that his text was genuine and sincere.
But he attached himself with peculiar devotion to the writings and
character of St. Paul: the name of the Paulicians is derived by their
enemies from some unknown and domestic teacher; but I am confident
that they gloried in their affinity to the apostle of the Gentiles.
His disciples, Titus, Timothy, Sylvanus, Tychicus, were represented by
Constantine and his fellow-laborers: the names of the apostolic churches
were applied to the congregations which they assembled in Armenia and
Cappadocia; and this innocent allegory revived the example and memory
of the first ages. In the Gospel, and the Epistles of St. Paul, his
faithful follower investigated the Creed of primitive Christianity;
and, whatever might be the success, a Protestant reader will applaud
the spirit, of the inquiry. But if the Scriptures of the Paulicians were
pure, they were not perfect. Their founders rejected the two Epistles of
St. Peter, <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> the apostle of the circumcision, whose dispute with their
favorite for the observance of the law could not easily be forgiven. <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a>
They agreed with their Gnostic brethren in the universal contempt for
the Old Testament, the books of Moses and the prophets, which have been
consecrated by the decrees of the Catholic church. With equal boldness,
and doubtless with more reason, Constantine, the new Sylvanus,
disclaimed the visions, which, in so many bulky and splendid volumes,
had been published by the Oriental sects; <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> the fabulous productions
of the Hebrew patriarchs and the sages of the East; the spurious
gospels, epistles, and acts, which in the first age had overwhelmed the
orthodox code; the theology of Manes, and the authors of the kindred
heresies; and the thirty generations, or aeons, which had been created
by the fruitful fancy of Valentine. The Paulicians sincerely condemned
the memory and opinions of the Manichaean sect, and complained of the
injustice which impressed that invidious name on the simple votaries of
St. Paul and of Christ.

contained eight hundred villages. Of these, two were inhabited by Arians
and Eunomians, and eight by Marcionites, whom the laborious bishop

Sicul. p. 756;) but as such neglect is not imputed as a crime, the
Greeks of the ixth century must have been careless of the credit and
honor of the Revelations.]

consult the researches of Beausobre, (Hist. Critique du Manicheisme,
tom. i. p. 305-437.) Even in Africa, St. Austin could describe the
Manichaean books, tam multi, tam grandes, tam pretiosi codices, (contra
Faust. xiii. 14;) but he adds, without pity, Incendite omnes illas
membranas: and his advice had been rigorously followed.]
</p>
<p>
Of the ecclesiastical chain, many links had been broken by the Paulician
reformers; and their liberty was enlarged, as they reduced the number of
masters, at whose voice profane reason must bow to mystery and miracle.
The early separation of the Gnostics had preceded the establishment of
the Catholic worship; and against the gradual innovations of discipline
and doctrine they were as strongly guarded by habit and aversion, as by
the silence of St. Paul and the evangelists. The objects which had been
transformed by the magic of superstition, appeared to the eyes of the
Paulicians in their genuine and naked colors. An image made without
hands was the common workmanship of a mortal artist, to whose skill
alone the wood and canvas must be indebted for their merit or value. The
miraculous relics were a heap of bones and ashes, destitute of life or
virtue, or of any relation, perhaps, with the person to whom they were
ascribed. The true and vivifying cross was a piece of sound or rotten
timber, the body and blood of Christ, a loaf of bread and a cup of wine,
the gifts of nature and the symbols of grace. The mother of God was
degraded from her celestial honors and immaculate virginity; and the
saints and angels were no longer solicited to exercise the laborious
office of meditation in heaven, and ministry upon earth. In the
practice, or at least in the theory, of the sacraments, the Paulicians
were inclined to abolish all visible objects of worship, and the words
of the gospel were, in their judgment, the baptism and communion of the
faithful. They indulged a convenient latitude for the interpretation of
Scripture: and as often as they were pressed by the literal sense, they
could escape to the intricate mazes of figure and allegory. Their utmost
diligence must have been employed to dissolve the connection between the
Old and the New Testament; since they adored the latter as the oracles
of God, and abhorred the former as the fabulous and absurd invention of
men or daemons. We cannot be surprised, that they should have found
in the Gospel the orthodox mystery of the Trinity: but, instead of
confessing the human nature and substantial sufferings of Christ, they
amused their fancy with a celestial body that passed through the virgin
like water through a pipe; with a fantastic crucifixion, that eluded the
vain and important malice of the Jews. A creed thus simple and spiritual
was not adapted to the genius of the times; <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> and the rational
Christian, who might have been contented with the light yoke and
easy burden of Jesus and his apostles, was justly offended, that the
Paulicians should dare to violate the unity of God, the first article of
natural and revealed religion. Their belief and their trust was in the
Father, of Christ, of the human soul, and of the invisible world.
</p>
<p>
But they likewise held the eternity of matter; a stubborn and rebellious
substance, the origin of a second principle of an active being, who has
created this visible world, and exercises his temporal reign till the
final consummation of death and sin. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> The appearances of moral
and physical evil had established the two principles in the ancient
philosophy and religion of the East; from whence this doctrine was
transfused to the various swarms of the Gnostics. A thousand shades may
be devised in the nature and character of Ahriman, from a rival god to
a subordinate daemon, from passion and frailty to pure and perfect
malevolence: but, in spite of our efforts, the goodness, and the power,
of Ormusd are placed at the opposite extremities of the line; and every
step that approaches the one must recede in equal proportion from the
other. <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a>

[ Two learned critics, Beausobre (Hist. Critique du
Manicheisme, l. i. iv. v. vi.) and Mosheim, (Institut. Hist. Eccles. and
de Rebus Christianis ante Constantinum, sec. i. ii. iii.,) have labored
to explore and discriminate the various systems of the Gnostics on the
subject of the two principles.]
</p>
<p>
The apostolic labors of Constantine Sylvanus soon multiplied the number
of his disciples, the secret recompense of spiritual ambition. The
remnant of the Gnostic sects, and especially the Manichaeans of Armenia,
were united under his standard; many Catholics were converted or seduced
by his arguments; and he preached with success in the regions of Pontus
<a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> and Cappadocia, which had long since imbibed the religion of
Zoroaster. The Paulician teachers were distinguished only by their
Scriptural names, by the modest title of Fellow-pilgrims, by the
austerity of their lives, their zeal or knowledge, and the credit of
some extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit. But they were incapable
of desiring, or at least of obtaining, the wealth and honors of the
Catholic prelacy; such anti-Christian pride they bitterly censured; and
even the rank of elders or presbyters was condemned as an institution of
the Jewish synagogue. The new sect was loosely spread over the provinces
of Asia Minor to the westward of the Euphrates; six of their principal
congregations represented the churches to which St. Paul had addressed
his epistles; and their founder chose his residence in the neighborhood
of Colonia, <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> in the same district of Pontus which had been
celebrated by the altars of Bellona <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> and the miracles of Gregory.
<a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> After a mission of twenty-seven years, Sylvanus, who had retired
from the tolerating government of the Arabs, fell a sacrifice to Roman
persecution. The laws of the pious emperors, which seldom touched the
lives of less odious heretics, proscribed without mercy or disguise the
tenets, the books, and the persons of the Montanists and Manichaeans:
the books were delivered to the flames; and all who should presume to
secrete such writings, or to profess such opinions, were devoted to an
ignominious death. <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> A Greek minister, armed with legal and military
powers, appeared at Colonia to strike the shepherd, and to reclaim, if
possible, the lost sheep. By a refinement of cruelty, Simeon placed the
unfortunate Sylvanus before a line of his disciples, who were commanded,
as the price of their pardon and the proof of their repentance, to
massacre their spiritual father. They turned aside from the impious
office; the stones dropped from their filial hands, and of the whole
number, only one executioner could be found, a new David, as he is
styled by the Catholics, who boldly overthrew the giant of heresy.
This apostate (Justin was his name) again deceived and betrayed his
unsuspecting brethren, and a new conformity to the acts of St. Paul may
be found in the conversion of Simeon: like the apostle, he embraced the
doctrine which he had been sent to persecute, renounced his honors and
fortunes, and required among the Paulicians the fame of a missionary and
a martyr. They were not ambitious of martyrdom, <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> but in a calamitous
period of one hundred and fifty years, their patience sustained
whatever zeal could inflict; and power was insufficient to eradicate the
obstinate vegetation of fanaticism and reason. From the blood and
ashes of the first victims, a succession of teachers and congregations
repeatedly arose: amidst their foreign hostilities, they found leisure
for domestic quarrels: they preached, they disputed, they suffered;
and the virtues, the apparent virtues, of Sergius, in a pilgrimage
of thirty-three years, are reluctantly confessed by the orthodox
historians. <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> The native cruelty of Justinian the Second was
stimulated by a pious cause; and he vainly hoped to extinguish, in a
single conflagration, the name and memory of the Paulicians. By their
primitive simplicity, their abhorrence of popular superstition,
the Iconoclast princes might have been reconciled to some erroneous
doctrines; but they themselves were exposed to the calumnies of the
monks, and they chose to be the tyrants, lest they should be accused
as the accomplices, of the Manichaeans. Such a reproach has sullied the
clemency of Nicephorus, who relaxed in their favor the severity of
the penal statutes, nor will his character sustain the honor of a
more liberal motive. The feeble Michael the First, the rigid Leo the
Armenian, were foremost in the race of persecution; but the prize
must doubtless be adjudged to the sanguinary devotion of Theodora, who
restored the images to the Oriental church. Her inquisitors explored
the cities and mountains of the Lesser Asia, and the flatterers of
the empress have affirmed that, in a short reign, one hundred thousand
Paulicians were extirpated by the sword, the gibbet, or the flames. Her
guilt or merit has perhaps been stretched beyond the measure of truth:
but if the account be allowed, it must be presumed that many simple
Iconoclasts were punished under a more odious name; and that some who
were driven from the church, unwillingly took refuge in the bosom of
heresy.

The most furious and desperate of rebels are the sectaries of a religion
long persecuted, and at length provoked. In a holy cause they are no
longer susceptible of fear or remorse: the justice of their arms hardens
them against the feelings of humanity; and they revenge their fathers'
wrongs on the children of their tyrants. Such have been the Hussites of
Bohemia and the Calvinists of France, and such, in the ninth century,
were the Paulicians of Armenia and the adjacent provinces. <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> They
were first awakened to the massacre of a governor and bishop, who
exercised the Imperial mandate of converting or destroying the heretics;
and the deepest recesses of Mount Argaeus protected their independence
and revenge. A more dangerous and consuming flame was kindled by the
persecution of Theodora, and the revolt of Carbeas, a valiant Paulician,
who commanded the guards of the general of the East. His father had been
impaled by the Catholic inquisitors; and religion, or at least nature,
might justify his desertion and revenge. Five thousand of his brethren
were united by the same motives; they renounced the allegiance of
anti-Christian Rome; a Saracen emir introduced Carbeas to the caliph;
and the commander of the faithful extended his sceptre to the implacable
enemy of the Greeks. In the mountains between Siwas and Trebizond he
founded or fortified the city of Tephrice, <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> which is still occupied
by a fierce or licentious people, and the neighboring hills were covered
with the Paulician fugitives, who now reconciled the use of the Bible
and the sword. During more than thirty years, Asia was afflicted by the
calamities of foreign and domestic war; in their hostile inroads,
the disciples of St. Paul were joined with those of Mahomet; and
the peaceful Christians, the aged parent and tender virgin, who were
delivered into barbarous servitude, might justly accuse the intolerant
spirit of their sovereign. So urgent was the mischief, so intolerable
the shame, that even the dissolute Michael, the son of Theodora, was
compelled to march in person against the Paulicians: he was defeated
under the walls of Samosata; and the Roman emperor fled before the
heretics whom his mother had condemned to the flames. The Saracens
fought under the same banners, but the victory was ascribed to Carbeas;
and the captive generals, with more than a hundred tribunes, were either
released by his avarice, or tortured by his fanaticism. The valor and
ambition of Chrysocheir, <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> his successor, embraced a wider circle
of rapine and revenge. In alliance with his faithful Moslems, he boldly
penetrated into the heart of Asia; the troops of the frontier and
the palace were repeatedly overthrown; the edicts of persecution were
answered by the pillage of Nice and Nicomedia, of Ancyra and Ephesus;
nor could the apostle St. John protect from violation his city and
sepulchre. The cathedral of Ephesus was turned into a stable for mules
and horses; and the Paulicians vied with the Saracens in their contempt
and abhorrence of images and relics. It is not unpleasing to observe
the triumph of rebellion over the same despotism which had disdained
the prayers of an injured people. The emperor Basil, the Macedonian,
was reduced to sue for peace, to offer a ransom for the captives, and
to request, in the language of moderation and charity, that Chrysocheir
would spare his fellow-Christians, and content himself with a royal
donative of gold and silver and silk garments. "If the emperor," replied
the insolent fanatic, "be desirous of peace, let him abdicate the East,
and reign without molestation in the West. If he refuse, the servants
of the Lord will precipitate him from the throne." The reluctant Basil
suspended the treaty, accepted the defiance, and led his army into the
land of heresy, which he wasted with fire and sword. The open country
of the Paulicians was exposed to the same calamities which they had
inflicted; but when he had explored the strength of Tephrice, the
multitude of the Barbarians, and the ample magazines of arms and
provisions, he desisted with a sigh from the hopeless siege. On his
return to Constantinople, he labored, by the foundation of convents and
churches, to secure the aid of his celestial patrons, of Michael the
archangel and the prophet Elijah; and it was his daily prayer that he
might live to transpierce, with three arrows, the head of his impious
adversary. Beyond his expectations, the wish was accomplished: after a
successful inroad, Chrysocheir was surprised and slain in his retreat;
and the rebel's head was triumphantly presented at the foot of the
throne. On the reception of this welcome trophy, Basil instantly called
for his bow, discharged three arrows with unerring aim, and accepted the
applause of the court, who hailed the victory of the royal archer. With
Chrysocheir, the glory of the Paulicians faded and withered: <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> on the
second expedition of the emperor, the impregnable Tephrice, was deserted
by the heretics, who sued for mercy or escaped to the borders. The city
was ruined, but the spirit of independence survived in the mountains:
the Paulicians defended, above a century, their religion and liberty,
infested the Roman limits, and maintained their perpetual alliance with
the enemies of the empire and the gospel.

<h2>
    Chapter LIV: Origin And Doctrine Of The Paulicians.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
About the middle of the eight century, Constantine, surnamed Copronymus
by the worshippers of images, had made an expedition into Armenia, and
found, in the cities of Melitene and Theodosiopolis, a great number
of Paulicians, his kindred heretics. As a favor, or punishment, he
transplanted them from the banks of the Euphrates to Constantinople
and Thrace; and by this emigration their doctrine was introduced and
diffused in Europe. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> If the sectaries of the metropolis were soon
mingled with the promiscuous mass, those of the country struck a deep
root in a foreign soil. The Paulicians of Thrace resisted the storms
of persecution, maintained a secret correspondence with their Armenian
brethren, and gave aid and comfort to their preachers, who solicited,
not without success, the infant faith of the Bulgarians. <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> In the
tenth century, they were restored and multiplied by a more powerful
colony, which John Zimisces <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> transported from the Chalybian hills
to the valleys of Mount Haemus. The Oriental clergy who would have
preferred the destruction, impatiently sighed for the absence, of the
Manichaeans: the warlike emperor had felt and esteemed their valor:
their attachment to the Saracens was pregnant with mischief; but, on
the side of the Danube, against the Barbarians of Scythia, their service
might be useful, and their loss would be desirable. Their exile in a
distant land was softened by a free toleration: the Paulicians held the
city of Philippopolis and the keys of Thrace; the Catholics were their
subjects; the Jacobite emigrants their associates: they occupied a
line of villages and castles in Macedonia and Epirus; and many native
Bulgarians were associated to the communion of arms and heresy. As long
as they were awed by power and treated with moderation, their voluntary
bands were distinguished in the armies of the empire; and the courage of
these dogs, ever greedy of war, ever thirsty of human blood, is noticed
with astonishment, and almost with reproach, by the pusillanimous
Greeks. The same spirit rendered them arrogant and contumacious: they
were easily provoked by caprice or injury; and their privileges were
often violated by the faithless bigotry of the government and clergy.
In the midst of the Norman war, two thousand five hundred Manichaeans
deserted the standard of Alexius Comnenus, <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> and retired to their
native homes. He dissembled till the moment of revenge; invited the
chiefs to a friendly conference; and punished the innocent and guilty
by imprisonment, confiscation, and baptism. In an interval of peace, the
emperor undertook the pious office of reconciling them to the church
and state: his winter quarters were fixed at Philippopolis; and the
thirteenth apostle, as he is styled by his pious daughter, consumed
whole days and nights in theological controversy. His arguments were
fortified, their obstinacy was melted, by the honors and rewards which
he bestowed on the most eminent proselytes; and a new city, surrounded
with gardens, enriched with immunities, and dignified with his own name,
was founded by Alexius for the residence of his vulgar converts. The
important station of Philippopolis was wrested from their hands; the
contumacious leaders were secured in a dungeon, or banished from their
country; and their lives were spared by the prudence, rather than the
mercy, of an emperor, at whose command a poor and solitary heretic was
burnt alive before the church of St. Sophia. <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> But the proud hope of
eradicating the prejudices of a nation was speedily overturned by the
invincible zeal of the Paulicians, who ceased to dissemble or refused to
obey. After the departure and death of Alexius, they soon resumed their
civil and religious laws. In the beginning of the thirteenth century,
their pope or primate (a manifest corruption) resided on the confines of
Bulgaria, Croatia, and Dalmatia, and governed, by his vicars, the
filial congregations of Italy and France. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> From that aera, a minute
scrutiny might prolong and perpetuate the chain of tradition. At the end
of the last age, the sect or colony still inhabited the valleys of Mount
Haemus, where their ignorance and poverty were more frequently
tormented by the Greek clergy than by the Turkish government. The modern
Paulicians have lost all memory of their origin; and their religion
is disgraced by the worship of the cross, and the practice of bloody
sacrifice, which some captives have imported from the wilds of Tartary.

In the West, the first teachers of the Manichaean theology had been
repulsed by the people, or suppressed by the prince. The favor and
success of the Paulicians in the eleventh and twelfth centuries must be
imputed to the strong, though secret, discontent which armed the most
pious Christians against the church of Rome. Her avarice was oppressive,
her despotism odious; less degenerate perhaps than the Greeks in the
worship of saints and images, her innovations were more rapid and
scandalous: she had rigorously defined and imposed the doctrine of
transubstantiation: the lives of the Latin clergy were more corrupt, and
the Eastern bishops might pass for the successors of the apostles, if
they were compared with the lordly prelates, who wielded by turns
the crosier, the sceptre, and the sword. Three different roads might
introduce the Paulicians into the heart of Europe. After the conversion
of Hungary, the pilgrims who visited Jerusalem might safely follow the
course of the Danube: in their journey and return they passed through
Philippopolis; and the sectaries, disguising their name and heresy,
might accompany the French or German caravans to their respective
countries. The trade and dominion of Venice pervaded the coast of the
Adriatic, and the hospitable republic opened her bosom to foreigners of
every climate and religion. Under the Byzantine standard, the Paulicians
were often transported to the Greek provinces of Italy and Sicily: in
peace and war, they freely conversed with strangers and natives, and
their opinions were silently propagated in Rome, Milan, and the kingdoms
beyond the Alps. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> It was soon discovered, that many thousand
Catholics of every rank, and of either sex, had embraced the Manichaean
heresy; and the flames which consumed twelve canons of Orleans was the
first act and signal of persecution. The Bulgarians, <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> a name so
innocent in its origin, so odious in its application, spread their
branches over the face of Europe. United in common hatred of idolatry
and Rome, they were connected by a form of episcopal and presbyterian
government; their various sects were discriminated by some fainter
or darker shades of theology; but they generally agreed in the two
principles, the contempt of the Old Testament and the denial of the
body of Christ, either on the cross or in the eucharist. A confession of
simple worship and blameless manners is extorted from their enemies;
and so high was their standard of perfection, that the increasing
congregations were divided into two classes of disciples, of those
who practised, and of those who aspired. It was in the country of the
Albigeois, <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> in the southern provinces of France, that the Paulicians
were most deeply implanted; and the same vicissitudes of martyrdom and
revenge which had been displayed in the neighborhood of the Euphrates,
were repeated in the thirteenth century on the banks of the Rhone. The
laws of the Eastern emperors were revived by Frederic the Second. The
insurgents of Tephrice were represented by the barons and cities of
Languedoc: Pope Innocent III. surpassed the sanguinary fame of Theodora.
It was in cruelty alone that her soldiers could equal the heroes of
the Crusades, and the cruelty of her priests was far excelled by the
founders of the Inquisition; <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> an office more adapted to confirm,
than to refute, the belief of an evil principle. The visible assemblies
of the Paulicians, or Albigeois, were extirpated by fire and sword;
and the bleeding remnant escaped by flight, concealment, or Catholic
conformity. But the invincible spirit which they had kindled still lived
and breathed in the Western world. In the state, in the church, and even
in the cloister, a latent succession was preserved of the disciples of
St. Paul; who protested against the tyranny of Rome, embraced the Bible
as the rule of faith, and purified their creed from all the visions of
the Gnostic theology. <a href="#note-3111" name="noteref-3111"><small>3111</small></a> The struggles of Wickliff in England,
of Huss in Bohemia, were premature and ineffectual; but the names of
Zuinglius, Luther, and Calvin, are pronounced with gratitude as the
deliverers of nations.

<p>
A philosopher, who calculates the degree of their merit and the value of
their reformation, will prudently ask from what articles of faith, above
or against our reason, they have enfranchised the Christians; for such
enfranchisement is doubtless a benefit so far as it may be compatible
with truth and piety. After a fair discussion, we shall rather be
surprised by the timidity, than scandalized by the freedom, of our first
reformers. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> With the Jews, they adopted the belief and defence of
all the Hebrew Scriptures, with all their prodigies, from the garden of
Eden to the visions of the prophet Daniel; and they were bound, like the
Catholics, to justify against the Jews the abolition of a divine law.
In the great mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation the reformers were
severely orthodox: they freely adopted the theology of the four, or the
six first councils; and with the Athanasian creed, they pronounced
the eternal damnation of all who did not believe the Catholic faith.
Transubstantiation, the invisible change of the bread and wine into the
body and blood of Christ, is a tenet that may defy the power of argument
and pleasantry; but instead of consulting the evidence of their senses,
of their sight, their feeling, and their taste, the first Protestants
were entangled in their own scruples, and awed by the words of Jesus
in the institution of the sacrament. Luther maintained a corporeal, and
Calvin a real, presence of Christ in the eucharist; and the opinion
of Zuinglius, that it is no more than a spiritual communion, a simple
memorial, has slowly prevailed in the reformed churches. <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> But the
loss of one mystery was amply compensated by the stupendous doctrines of
original sin, redemption, faith, grace, and predestination, which have
been strained from the epistles of St. Paul. These subtile questions had
most assuredly been prepared by the fathers and schoolmen; but the final
improvement and popular use may be attributed to the first reformers,
who enforced them as the absolute and essential terms of salvation.
Hitherto the weight of supernatural belief inclines against the
Protestants; and many a sober Christian would rather admit that a wafer
is God, than that God is a cruel and capricious tyrant.

obliterated in the original copy, to please the people or the Lutherans,
or Queen Elizabeth, (Burnet's History of the Reformation, vol. ii. p.
82, 128, 302.)]
</p>
<p>
Yet the services of Luther and his rivals are solid and important; and
the philosopher must own his obligations to these fearless enthusiasts.
<a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> I. By their hands the lofty fabric of superstition, from the abuse
of indulgences to the intercesson of the Virgin, has been levelled
with the ground. Myriads of both sexes of the monastic profession were
restored to the liberty and labors of social life. A hierarchy of saints
and angels, of imperfect and subordinate deities, were stripped of their
temporal power, and reduced to the enjoyment of celestial happiness;
their images and relics were banished from the church; and the credulity
of the people was no longer nourished with the daily repetition of
miracles and visions. The imitation of Paganism was supplied by a pure
and spiritual worship of prayer and thanksgiving, the most worthy
of man, the least unworthy of the Deity. It only remains to observe,
whether such sublime simplicity be consistent with popular devotion;
whether the vulgar, in the absence of all visible objects, will not
be inflamed by enthusiasm, or insensibly subside in languor and
indifference. II. The chain of authority was broken, which restrains
the bigot from thinking as he pleases, and the slave from speaking as he
thinks: the popes, fathers, and councils, were no longer the supreme
and infallible judges of the world; and each Christian was taught
to acknowledge no law but the Scriptures, no interpreter but his own
conscience. This freedom, however, was the consequence, rather than
the design, of the Reformation. The patriot reformers were ambitious of
succeeding the tyrants whom they had dethroned. They imposed with equal
rigor their creeds and confessions; they asserted the right of the
magistrate to punish heretics with death. The pious or personal
animosity of Calvin proscribed in Servetus <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> the guilt of his own
rebellion; <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> and the flames of Smithfield, in which he was afterwards
consumed, had been kindled for the Anabaptists by the zeal of Cranmer.
<a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> The nature of the tiger wa s the same, but he was gradually
deprived of his teeth and fangs. A spiritual and temporal kingdom was
possessed by the Roman pontiff; the Protestant doctors were subjects
of an humble rank, without revenue or jurisdiction. His decrees were
consecrated by the antiquity of the Catholic church: their arguments
and disputes were submitted to the people; and their appeal to private
judgment was accepted beyond their wishes, by curiosity and enthusiasm.
Since the days of Luther and Calvin, a secret reformation has been
silently working in the bosom of the reformed churches; many weeds of
prejudice were eradicated; and the disciples of Erasmus <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> diffused
a spirit of freedom and moderation. The liberty of conscience has
been claimed as a common benefit, an inalienable right: <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> the free
governments of Holland <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> and England <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> introduced the practice of
toleration; and the narrow allowance of the laws has been enlarged by
the prudence and humanity of the times. In the exercise, the mind has
understood the limits of its powers, and the words and shadows that
might amuse the child can no longer satisfy his manly reason. The
volumes of controversy are overspread with cobwebs: the doctrine of a
Protestant church is far removed from the knowledge or belief of its
private members; and the forms of orthodoxy, the articles of faith,
are subscribed with a sigh, or a smile, by the modern clergy. Yet the
friends of Christianity are alarmed at the boundless impulse of inquiry
and scepticism. The predictions of the Catholics are accomplished: the
web of mystery is unravelled by the Arminians, Arians, and Socinians,
whose number must not be computed from their separate congregations; and
the pillars of Revelation are shaken by those men who preserve the name
without the substance of religion, who indulge the license without the
temper of philosophy. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> <a href="#note-4211" name="noteref-4211"><small>4211</small></a>

their common enemies, the judges of Vienna, and betrayed, for his
destruction, the sacred trust of a private correspondence. 2. The deed

who neither preached, nor printed, nor made proselytes. 3. A Catholic

[ Erasmus may be considered as the father of rational
theology. After a slumber of a hundred years, it was revived by the
Arminians of Holland, Grotius, Limborch, and Le Clerc; in England by
Chillingworth, the latitudinarians of Cambridge, (Burnet, Hist. of Own
Times, vol. i. p. 261-268, octavo edition.) Tillotson, Clarke, Hoadley,
&amp;c.]

[ I am sorry to observe, that the three writers of the
last age, by whom the rights of toleration have been so nobly defended,
Bayle, Leibnitz, and Locke, are all laymen and philosophers.]

[ See the excellent chapter of Sir William Temple on the
Religion of the United Provinces. I am not satisfied with Grotius, (de
Rebus Belgicis, Annal. l. i. p. 13, 14, edit. in 12mo.,) who approves
the Imperial laws of persecution, and only condemns the bloody tribunal
of the inquisition.]

[ Sir William Blackstone (Commentaries, vol. iv. p. 53,
54) explains the law of England as it was fixed at the Revolution. The
exceptions of Papists, and of those who deny the Trinity, would still
have a tolerable scope for persecution if the national spirit were not
more effectual than a hundred statutes.]

[ I shall recommend to public animadversion two passages in
Dr. Priestley, which betray the ultimate tendency of his opinions. At
the first of these (Hist. of the Corruptions of Christianity, vol. i.
p. 275, 276) the priest, at the second (vol. ii. p. 484) the magistrate,
may tremble!]

[ There is something ludicrous, if it were not offensive,
in Gibbon holding up to "public animadversion" the opinions of any
believer in Christianity, however imperfect his creed. The observations
which the whole of this passage on the effects of the reformation,
in which much truth and justice is mingled with much prejudice, would
suggest, could not possibly be compressed into a note; and would indeed
embrace the whole religious and irreligious history of the time which
has elapsed since Gibbon wrote.&mdash;M.]
