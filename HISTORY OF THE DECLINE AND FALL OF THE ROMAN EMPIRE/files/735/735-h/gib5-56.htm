<p>
The three great nations of the world, the Greeks, the Saracens, and the
Franks, encountered each other on the theatre of Italy. <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> The southern
provinces, which now compose the kingdom of Naples, were subject, for
the most part, to the Lombard dukes and princes of Beneventum; <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a>
so powerful in war, that they checked for a moment the genius of
Charlemagne; so liberal in peace, that they maintained in their capital
an academy of thirty-two philosophers and grammarians. The division of
this flourishing state produced the rival principalities of Benevento,
Salerno, and Capua; and the thoughtless ambition or revenge of
the competitors invited the Saracens to the ruin of their common
inheritance. During a calamitous period of two hundred years, Italy was
exposed to a repetition of wounds, which the invaders were not capable
of healing by the union and tranquility of a perfect conquest. Their
frequent and almost annual squadrons issued from the port of Palermo,
and were entertained with too much indulgence by the Christians of
Naples: the more formidable fleets were prepared on the African coast;
and even the Arabs of Andalusia were sometimes tempted to assist or
oppose the Moslems of an adverse sect. In the revolution of human
events, a new ambuscade was concealed in the Caudine Forks, the fields
of Cannae were bedewed a second time with the blood of the Africans, and
the sovereign of Rome again attacked or defended the walls of Capua and
Tarentum. A colony of Saracens had been planted at Bari, which commands
the entrance of the Adriatic Gulf; and their impartial depredations
provoked the resentment, and conciliated the union of the two emperors.
An offensive alliance was concluded between Basil the Macedonian, the
first of his race, and Lewis the great-grandson of Charlemagne; <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> and
each party supplied the deficiencies of his associate. It would have
been imprudent in the Byzantine monarch to transport his stationary
troops of Asia to an Italian campaign; and the Latin arms would have
been insufficient if his superior navy had not occupied the mouth of the
Gulf. The fortress of Bari was invested by the infantry of the Franks,
and by the cavalry and galleys of the Greeks; and, after a defence of
four years, the Arabian emir submitted to the clemency of Lewis, who
commanded in person the operations of the siege. This important conquest
had been achieved by the concord of the East and West; but their recent
amity was soon imbittered by the mutual complaints of jealousy and
pride. The Greeks assumed as their own the merit of the conquest and
the pomp of the triumph; extolled the greatness of their powers,
and affected to deride the intemperance and sloth of the handful of
Barbarians who appeared under the banners of the Carlovingian prince.
His reply is expressed with the eloquence of indignation and truth: "We
confess the magnitude of your preparation," says the great-grandson of
Charlemagne. "Your armies were indeed as numerous as a cloud of summer
locusts, who darken the day, flap their wings, and, after a short
flight, tumble weary and breathless to the ground. Like them, ye sunk
after a feeble effort; ye were vanquished by your own cowardice; and
withdrew from the scene of action to injure and despoil our Christian
subjects of the Sclavonian coast. We were few in number, and why were
we few? Because, after a tedious expectation of your arrival, I had
dismissed my host, and retained only a chosen band of warriors to
continue the blockade of the city. If they indulged their hospitable
feasts in the face of danger and death, did these feasts abate the vigor
of their enterprise? Is it by your fasting that the walls of Bari have
been overturned? Did not these valiant Franks, diminished as they were
by languor and fatigue, intercept and vanish the three most powerful
emirs of the Saracens? and did not their defeat precipitate the fall
of the city? Bari is now fallen; Tarentum trembles; Calabria will be
delivered; and, if we command the sea, the Island of Sicily may be
rescued from the hands of the infidels. My brother," accelerate (a
name most offensive to the vanity of the Greek,) "accelerate your naval
succors, respect your allies, and distrust your flatterers." <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a>

viith and viiith volumes (the octavo edition) of the Annali d' Italia
of Muratori, and the 2d volume of the Abrege Chronologique of M. de St.
Marc, a work which, under a superficial title, contains much genuine
learning and industry. But my long-accustomed reader will give me credit
for saying, that I myself have ascended to the fountain head, as often
as such ascent could be either profitable or possible; and that I have

[ The oriental epistle of the emperor Lewis II. to the
emperor Basil, a curious record of the age, was first published by
Baronius, (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 871, No. 51-71,) from the Vatican Ms.
of Erchempert, or rather of the anonymous historian of Salerno.] These
lofty hopes were soon extinguished by the death of Lewis, and the decay
of the Carlovingian house; and whoever might deserve the honor, the
Greek emperors, Basil, and his son Leo, secured the advantage, of the
reduction of Bari The Italians of Apulia and Calabria were persuaded or
compelled to acknowledge their supremacy, and an ideal line from Mount
Garganus to the Bay of Salerno, leaves the far greater part of the
kingdom of Naples under the dominion of the Eastern empire. Beyond that
line, the dukes or republics of Amalfi <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> and Naples, who had never
forfeited their voluntary allegiance, rejoiced in the neighborhood of
their lawful sovereign; and Amalfi was enriched by supplying Europe
with the produce and manufactures of Asia. But the Lombard princes
of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua, <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> were reluctantly torn from the
communion of the Latin world, and too often violated their oaths of
servitude and tribute. The city of Bari rose to dignity and wealth, as
the metropolis of the new theme or province of Lombardy: the title of
patrician, and afterwards the singular name of Catapan, <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> was assigned
to the supreme governor; and the policy both of the church and state was
modelled in exact subordination to the throne of Constantinople. As long
as the sceptre was disputed by the princes of Italy, their efforts were
feeble and adverse; and the Greeks resisted or eluded the forces of
Germany, which descended from the Alps under the Imperial standard of
the Othos. The first and greatest of those Saxon princes was compelled
to relinquish the siege of Bari: the second, after the loss of his
stoutest bishops and barons, escaped with honor from the bloody field of
Crotona. On that day the scale of war was turned against the Franks by
the valor of the Saracens. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> These corsairs had indeed been driven
by the Byzantine fleets from the fortresses and coasts of Italy; but a
sense of interest was more prevalent than superstition or resentment,
and the caliph of Egypt had transported forty thousand Moslems to the
aid of his Christian ally. The successors of Basil amused themselves
with the belief, that the conquest of Lombardy had been achieved, and
was still preserved by the justice of their laws, the virtues of their
ministers, and the gratitude of a people whom they had rescued from
anarchy and oppression. A series of rebellions might dart a ray of truth
into the palace of Constantinople; and the illusions of flattery were
dispelled by the easy and rapid success of the Norman adventurers.

</p>
<p>
The revolution of human affairs had produced in Apulia and Calabria a
melancholy contrast between the age of Pythagoras and the tenth century
of the Christian aera. At the former period, the coast of Great Greece
(as it was then styled) was planted with free and opulent cities: these
cities were peopled with soldiers, artists, and philosophers; and the
military strength of Tarentum; Sybaris, or Crotona, was not inferior to
that of a powerful kingdom. At the second aera, these once flourishing
provinces were clouded with ignorance impoverished by tyranny, and
depopulated by Barbarian war nor can we severely accuse the exaggeration
of a contemporary, that a fair and ample district was reduced to the
same desolation which had covered the earth after the general deluge.
<a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> Among the hostilities of the Arabs, the Franks, and the Greeks, in
the southern Italy, I shall select two or three anecdotes expressive
of their national manners. 1. It was the amusement of the Saracens to
profane, as well as to pillage, the monasteries and churches. At
the siege of Salerno, a Mussulman chief spread his couch on the
communion-table, and on that altar sacrificed each night the virginity
of a Christian nun. As he wrestled with a reluctant maid, a beam in the
roof was accidentally or dexterously thrown down on his head; and the
death of the lustful emir was imputed to the wrath of Christ, which was
at length awakened to the defence of his faithful spouse. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> 2. The
Saracens besieged the cities of Beneventum and Capua: after a vain
appeal to the successors of Charlemagne, the Lombards implored the
clemency and aid of the Greek emperor. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> A fearless citizen dropped
from the walls, passed the intrenchments, accomplished his commission,
and fell into the hands of the Barbarians as he was returning with the
welcome news. They commanded him to assist their enterprise, and deceive
his countrymen, with the assurance that wealth and honors should be the
reward of his falsehood, and that his sincerity would be punished with
immediate death. He affected to yield, but as soon as he was conducted
within hearing of the Christians on the rampart, "Friends and brethren,"
he cried with a loud voice, "be bold and patient, maintain the city;
your sovereign is informed of your distress, and your deliverers are
at hand. I know my doom, and commit my wife and children to your
gratitude." The rage of the Arabs confirmed his evidence; and the
self-devoted patriot was transpierced with a hundred spears. He deserves
to live in the memory of the virtuous, but the repetition of the same
story in ancient and modern times, may sprinkle some doubts on the
reality of this generous deed. <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> 3. The recital of a third incident
may provoke a smile amidst the horrors of war. Theobald, marquis of
Camerino and Spoleto, <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> supported the rebels of Beneventum; and his
wanton cruelty was not incompatible in that age with the character of a
hero. His captives of the Greek nation or party were castrated without
mercy, and the outrage was aggravated by a cruel jest, that he wished
to present the emperor with a supply of eunuchs, the most precious
ornaments of the Byzantine court. The garrison of a castle had been
defeated in a sally, and the prisoners were sentenced to the customary
operation. But the sacrifice was disturbed by the intrusion of a frantic
female, who, with bleeding cheeks dishevelled hair, and importunate
clamors, compelled the marquis to listen to her complaint. "Is it thus,"
she cried, "ye magnanimous heroes, that ye wage war against women,
against women who have never injured ye, and whose only arms are the
distaff and the loom?" Theobald denied the charge, and protested that,
since the Amazons, he had never heard of a female war. "And how," she
furiously exclaimed, "can you attack us more directly, how can you wound
us in a more vital part, than by robbing our husbands of what we most
dearly cherish, the source of our joys, and the hope of our posterity?
The plunder of our flocks and herds I have endured without a murmur, but
this fatal injury, this irreparable loss, subdues my patience, and calls
aloud on the justice of heaven and earth." A general laugh applauded her
eloquence; the savage Franks, inaccessible to pity, were moved by
her ridiculous, yet rational despair; and with the deliverance of the
captives, she obtained the restitution of her effects. As she returned
in triumph to the castle, she was overtaken by a messenger, to inquire,
in the name of Theobald, what punishment should be inflicted on her
husband, were he again taken in arms. "Should such," she answered
without hesitation, "be his guilt and misfortune, he has eyes, and a
nose, and hands, and feet. These are his own, and these he may deserve
to forfeit by his personal offences. But let my lord be pleased to spare
what his little handmaid presumes to claim as her peculiar and lawful
property." <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a>

different, and the guilt is imputed to the Greeks themselves, which in

said to have devoted himself in a similar manner. His behavior is the

<p>
The establishment of the Normans in the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily
<a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> is an event most romantic in its origin, and in its consequences
most important both to Italy and the Eastern empire. The broken
provinces of the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, were exposed to every
invader, and every sea and land were invaded by the adventurous spirit
of the Scandinavian pirates. After a long indulgence of rapine and
slaughter, a fair and ample territory was accepted, occupied, and named,
by the Normans of France: they renounced their gods for the God of the
Christians; <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> and the dukes of Normandy acknowledged themselves
the vassals of the successors of Charlemagne and Capet. The savage
fierceness which they had brought from the snowy mountains of Norway was
refined, without being corrupted, in a warmer climate; the companions
of Rollo insensibly mingled with the natives; they imbibed the manners,
language, <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> and gallantry, of the French nation; and in a
martial age, the Normans might claim the palm of valor and glorious
achievements. Of the fashionable superstitions, they embraced with ardor
the pilgrimages of Rome, Italy, and the Holy Land. <a href="#note-171" name="noteref-171"><small>171</small></a> In this active
devotion, the minds and bodies were invigorated by exercise: danger was
the incentive, novelty the recompense; and the prospect of the world was
decorated by wonder, credulity, and ambitious hope. They confederated
for their mutual defence; and the robbers of the Alps, who had been
allured by the garb of a pilgrim, were often chastised by the arm of a
warrior. In one of these pious visits to the cavern of Mount Garganus
in Apulia, which had been sanctified by the apparition of the archangel
Michael, <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> they were accosted by a stranger in the Greek habit, but
who soon revealed himself as a rebel, a fugitive, and a mortal foe of
the Greek empire. His name was Melo; a noble citizen of Bari, who, after
an unsuccessful revolt, was compelled to seek new allies and avengers
of his country. The bold appearance of the Normans revived his hopes
and solicited his confidence: they listened to the complaints, and
still more to the promises, of the patriot. The assurance of wealth
demonstrated the justice of his cause; and they viewed, as the
inheritance of the brave, the fruitful land which was oppressed by
effeminate tyrants. On their return to Normandy, they kindled a spark of
enterprise, and a small but intrepid band was freely associated for the
deliverance of Apulia. They passed the Alps by separate roads, and in
the disguise of pilgrims; but in the neighborhood of Rome they were
saluted by the chief of Bari, who supplied the more indigent with arms
and horses, and instantly led them to the field of action. In the first
conflict, their valor prevailed; but in the second engagement they
were overwhelmed by the numbers and military engines of the Greeks,
and indignantly retreated with their faces to the enemy. <a href="#note-1811" name="noteref-1811"><small>1811</small></a> The
unfortunate Melo ended his life a suppliant at the court of Germany: his
Norman followers, excluded from their native and their promised land,
wandered among the hills and valleys of Italy, and earned their daily
subsistence by the sword. To that formidable sword the princes of Capua,
Beneventum, Salerno, and Naples, alternately appealed in their domestic
quarrels; the superior spirit and discipline of the Normans gave victory
to the side which they espoused; and their cautious policy observed
the balance of power, lest the preponderance of any rival state should
render their aid less important, and their service less profitable.
Their first asylum was a strong camp in the depth of the marshes of
Campania: but they were soon endowed by the liberality of the duke of
Naples with a more plentiful and permanent seat. Eight miles from his
residence, as a bulwark against Capua, the town of Aversa was built
and fortified for their use; and they enjoyed as their own the corn and
fruits, the meadows and groves, of that fertile district. The report of
their success attracted every year new swarms of pilgrims and soldiers:
the poor were urged by necessity; the rich were excited by hope; and
the brave and active spirits of Normandy were impatient of ease and
ambitious of renown. The independent standard of Aversa afforded shelter
and encouragement to the outlaws of the province, to every fugitive who
had escaped from the injustice or justice of his superiors; and these
foreign associates were quickly assimilated in manners and language to
the Gallic colony. The first leader of the Normans was Count Rainulf;
and, in the origin of society, preeminence of rank is the reward and the
proof of superior merit. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> <a href="#note-1911" name="noteref-1911"><small>1911</small></a>

[ This account is not accurate. After the retreat of the
emperor Henry II. the Normans, united under the command of Rainulf, had
taken possession of Aversa, then a small castle in the duchy of Naples.
They had been masters of it a few years when Pandulf IV., prince of
Capua, found means to take Naples by surprise. Sergius, master of
the soldiers, and head of the republic, with the principal citizens,
abandoned a city in which he could not behold, without horror, the
establishment of a foreign dominion he retired to Aversa; and when, with
the assistance of the Greeks and that of the citizens faithful to their
country, he had collected money enough to satisfy the rapacity of the
Norman adventurers, he advanced at their head to attack the garrison of
the prince of Capua, defeated it, and reentered Naples. It was then that
he confirmed the Normans in the possession of Aversa and its territory,
which he raised into a count's fief, and granted the investiture to
Rainulf. Hist. des Rep. Ital. tom. i. p. 267]

Since the conquest of Sicily by the Arabs, the Grecian emperors had been
anxious to regain that valuable possession; but their efforts, however
strenuous, had been opposed by the distance and the sea. Their costly
armaments, after a gleam of success, added new pages of calamity and
disgrace to the Byzantine annals: twenty thousand of their best troops
were lost in a single expedition; and the victorious Moslems derided the
policy of a nation which intrusted eunuchs not only with the custody of
their women, but with the command of their men <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> After a reign of
two hundred years, the Saracens were ruined by their divisions. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a>
The emir disclaimed the authority of the king of Tunis; the people rose
against the emir; the cities were usurped by the chiefs; each meaner
rebel was independent in his village or castle; and the weaker of two
rival brothers implored the friendship of the Christians. In every
service of danger the Normans were prompt and useful; and five hundred
knights, or warriors on horseback, were enrolled by Arduin, the agent
and interpreter of the Greeks, under the standard of Maniaces, governor
of Lombardy. Before their landing, the brothers were reconciled; the
union of Sicily and Africa was restored; and the island was guarded to
the water's edge. The Normans led the van and the Arabs of Messina felt
the valor of an untried foe. In a second action the emir of Syracuse was
unhorsed and transpierced by the iron arm of William of Hauteville. In a
third engagement, his intrepid companions discomfited the host of sixty
thousand Saracens, and left the Greeks no more than the labor of the
pursuit: a splendid victory; but of which the pen of the historian may
divide the merit with the lance of the Normans. It is, however, true,
that they essentially promoted the success of Maniaces, who reduced
thirteen cities, and the greater part of Sicily, under the obedience
of the emperor. But his military fame was sullied by ingratitude
and tyranny. In the division of the spoils, the deserts of his brave
auxiliaries were forgotten; and neither their avarice nor their pride
could brook this injurious treatment. They complained by the mouth of
their interpreter: their complaint was disregarded; their interpreter
was scourged; the sufferings were his; the insult and resentment
belonged to those whose sentiments he had delivered. Yet they dissembled
till they had obtained, or stolen, a safe passage to the Italian
continent: their brethren of Aversa sympathized in their indignation,
and the province of Apulia was invaded as the forfeit of the debt. <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a>
Above twenty years after the first emigration, the Normans took the
field with no more than seven hundred horse and five hundred foot; and
after the recall of the Byzantine legions <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> from the Sicilian war,
their numbers are magnified to the amount of threescore thousand men.
Their herald proposed the option of battle or retreat; "of battle," was
the unanimous cry of the Normans; and one of their stoutest warriors,
with a stroke of his fist, felled to the ground the horse of the Greek
messenger. He was dismissed with a fresh horse; the insult was concealed
from the Imperial troops; but in two successive battles they were more
fatally instructed of the prowess of their adversaries. In the plains of
Cannae, the Asiatics fled before the adventurers of France; the duke of
Lombardy was made prisoner; the Apulians acquiesced in a new dominion;
and the four places of Bari, Otranto, Brundusium, and Tarentum, were
alone saved in the shipwreck of the Grecian fortunes. From this aera we
may date the establishment of the Norman power, which soon eclipsed the
infant colony of Aversa. Twelve counts <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> were chosen by the popular
suffrage; and age, birth, and merit, were the motives of their choice.
The tributes of their peculiar districts were appropriated to their use;
and each count erected a fortress in the midst of his lands, and at
the head of his vassals. In the centre of the province, the common
habitation of Melphi was reserved as the metropolis and citadel of
the republic; a house and separate quarter was allotted to each of the
twelve counts: and the national concerns were regulated by this military
senate. The first of his peers, their president and general, was
entitled count of Apulia; and this dignity was conferred on William
of the iron arm, who, in the language of the age, is styled a lion in
battle, a lamb in society, and an angel in council. <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> The manners
of his countrymen are fairly delineated by a contemporary and national
historian. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> "The Normans," says Malaterra, "are a cunning and
revengeful people; eloquence and dissimulation appear to be their
hereditary qualities: they can stoop to flatter; but unless they are
curbed by the restraint of law, they indulge the licentiousness
of nature and passion. Their princes affect the praises of popular
munificence; the people observe the medium, or rather blond the
extremes, of avarice and prodigality; and in their eager thirst of
wealth and dominion, they despise whatever they possess, and hope
whatever they desire. Arms and horses, the luxury of dress, the
exercises of hunting and hawking <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> are the delight of the Normans;
but, on pressing occasions, they can endure with incredible patience
the inclemency of every climate, and the toil and absence of a military
life." <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter LVI: The Saracens, The Franks And The Normans.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
The Normans of Apulia were seated on the verge of the two empires; and,
according to the policy of the hour, they accepted the investiture of
their lands, from the sovereigns of Germany or Constantinople. But
the firmest title of these adventurers was the right of conquest: they
neither loved nor trusted; they were neither trusted nor beloved: the
contempt of the princes was mixed with fear, and the fear of the natives
was mingled with hatred and resentment. Every object of desire, a
horse, a woman, a garden, tempted and gratified the rapaciousness of the
strangers; <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> and the avarice of their chiefs was only colored by
the more specious names of ambition and glory. The twelve counts were
sometimes joined in the league of injustice: in their domestic quarrels
they disputed the spoils of the people: the virtues of William were
buried in his grave; and Drogo, his brother and successor, was better
qualified to lead the valor, than to restrain the violence, of his
peers. Under the reign of Constantine Monomachus, the policy, rather
than benevolence, of the Byzantine court, attempted to relieve Italy
from this adherent mischief, more grievous than a flight of Barbarians;
<a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> and Argyrus, the son of Melo, was invested for this purpose with
the most lofty titles <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> and the most ample commission. The memory
of his father might recommend him to the Normans; and he had already
engaged their voluntary service to quell the revolt of Maniaces, and to
avenge their own and the public injury. It was the design of Constantine
to transplant the warlike colony from the Italian provinces to the
Persian war; and the son of Melo distributed among the chiefs the gold
and manufactures of Greece, as the first-fruits of the Imperial bounty.
But his arts were baffled by the sense and spirit of the conquerors of
Apulia: his gifts, or at least his proposals, were rejected; and they
unanimously refused to relinquish their possessions and their hopes for
the distant prospect of Asiatic fortune. After the means of persuasion
had failed, Argyrus resolved to compel or to destroy: the Latin powers
were solicited against the common enemy; and an offensive alliance was
formed of the pope and the two emperors of the East and West. The throne
of St. Peter was occupied by Leo the Ninth, a simple saint, <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> of a
temper most apt to deceive himself and the world, and whose venerable
character would consecrate with the name of piety the measures least
compatible with the practice of religion. His humanity was affected by
the complaints, perhaps the calumnies, of an injured people: the impious
Normans had interrupted the payment of tithes; and the temporal sword
might be lawfully unsheathed against the sacrilegious robbers, who were
deaf to the censures of the church. As a German of noble birth and royal
kindred, Leo had free access to the court and confidence of the emperor
Henry the Third; and in search of arms and allies, his ardent zeal
transported him from Apulia to Saxony, from the Elbe to the Tyber.
During these hostile preparations, Argyrus indulged himself in the use
of secret and guilty weapons: a crowd of Normans became the victims
of public or private revenge; and the valiant Drogo was murdered in a
church. But his spirit survived in his brother Humphrey, the third count
of Apulia. The assassins were chastised; and the son of Melo, overthrown
and wounded, was driven from the field, to hide his shame behind the
walls of Bari, and to await the tardy succor of his allies.

</p>
<p>
But the power of Constantine was distracted by a Turkish war; the mind
of Henry was feeble and irresolute; and the pope, instead of repassing
the Alps with a German army, was accompanied only by a guard of seven
hundred Swabians and some volunteers of Lorraine. In his long progress
from Mantua to Beneventum, a vile and promiscuous multitude of Italians
was enlisted under the holy standard: <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> the priest and the robber
slept in the same tent; the pikes and crosses were intermingled in the
front; and the martial saint repeated the lessons of his youth in the
order of march, of encampment, and of combat. The Normans of Apulia
could muster in the field no more than three thousand horse, with a
handful of infantry: the defection of the natives intercepted their
provisions and retreat; and their spirit, incapable of fear, was chilled
for a moment by superstitious awe. On the hostile approach of Leo, they
knelt without disgrace or reluctance before their spiritual father.
But the pope was inexorable; his lofty Germans affected to deride the
diminutive stature of their adversaries; and the Normans were informed
that death or exile was their only alternative. Flight they disdained,
and, as many of them had been three days without tasting food, they
embraced the assurance of a more easy and honorable death. They climbed
the hill of Civitella, descended into the plain, and charged in three
divisions the army of the pope. On the left, and in the centre, Richard
count of Aversa, and Robert the famous Guiscard, attacked, broke,
routed, and pursued the Italian multitudes, who fought without
discipline, and fled without shame. A harder trial was reserved for
the valor of Count Humphrey, who led the cavalry of the right wing. The
Germans <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> have been described as unskillful in the management of the
horse and the lance, but on foot they formed a strong and impenetrable
phalanx; and neither man, nor steed, nor armor, could resist the weight
of their long and two-handed swords. After a severe conflict, they were
encompassed by the squadrons returning from the pursuit; and died in the
ranks with the esteem of their foes, and the satisfaction of revenge.
The gates of Civitella were shut against the flying pope, and he was
overtaken by the pious conquerors, who kissed his feet, to implore his
blessing and the absolution of their sinful victory. The soldiers beheld
in their enemy and captive the vicar of Christ; and, though we may
suppose the policy of the chiefs, it is probable that they were infected
by the popular superstition. In the calm of retirement, the well-meaning
pope deplored the effusion of Christian blood, which must be imputed to
his account: he felt, that he had been the author of sin and scandal;
and as his undertaking had failed, the indecency of his military
character was universally condemned. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> With these dispositions, he
listened to the offers of a beneficial treaty; deserted an alliance
which he had preached as the cause of God; and ratified the past
and future conquests of the Normans. By whatever hands they had been
usurped, the provinces of Apulia and Calabria were a part of the
donation of Constantine and the patrimony of St. Peter: the grant
and the acceptance confirmed the mutual claims of the pontiff and the
adventurers. They promised to support each other with spiritual and
temporal arms; a tribute or quitrent of twelve pence was afterwards
stipulated for every ploughland; and since this memorable transaction,
the kingdom of Naples has remained above seven hundred years a fief of
the Holy See. <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The pedigree of Robert of Guiscard <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> is variously deduced from the
peasants and the dukes of Normandy: from the peasants, by the pride and
ignorance of a Grecian princess; <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> from the dukes, by the ignorance
and flattery of the Italian subjects. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> His genuine descent may be
ascribed to the second or middle order of private nobility. <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a>
He sprang from a race of valvassors or bannerets, of the diocese of
Coutances, in the Lower Normandy: the castle of Hauteville was their
honorable seat: his father Tancred was conspicuous in the court and army
of the duke; and his military service was furnished by ten soldiers or
knights. Two marriages, of a rank not unworthy of his own, made him
the father of twelve sons, who were educated at home by the impartial
tenderness of his second wife. But a narrow patrimony was insufficient
for this numerous and daring progeny; they saw around the neighborhood
the mischiefs of poverty and discord, and resolved to seek in foreign
wars a more glorious inheritance. Two only remained to perpetuate
the race, and cherish their father's age: their ten brothers, as they
successfully attained the vigor of manhood, departed from the castle,
passed the Alps, and joined the Apulian camp of the Normans. The elder
were prompted by native spirit; their success encouraged their younger
brethren, and the three first in seniority, William, Drogo, and
Humphrey, deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of
the new republic. Robert was the eldest of the seven sons of the second
marriage; and even the reluctant praise of his foes has endowed him with
the heroic qualities of a soldier and a statesman. His lofty stature
surpassed the tallest of his army: his limbs were cast in the true
proportion of strength and gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he
maintained the patient vigor of health and the commanding dignity of his
form. His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad, his hair and
beard were long and of a flaxen color, his eyes sparkled with fire, and
his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress obedience and terror
amidst the tumult of battle. In the ruder ages of chivalry, such
qualifications are not below the notice of the poet or historians: they
may observe that Robert, at once, and with equal dexterity, could wield
in the right hand his sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle
of Civitella he was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of that
memorable day he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valor from
the warriors of the two armies. <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> His boundless ambition was founded
on the consciousness of superior worth: in the pursuit of greatness, he
was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and seldom moved by the
feelings of humanity: though not insensible of fame, the choice of open
or clandestine means was determined only by his present advantage. The
surname of Guiscard <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> was applied to this master of political wisdom,
which is too often confounded with the practice of dissimulation and
deceit; and Robert is praised by the Apulian poet for excelling the
cunning of Ulysses and the eloquence of Cicero. Yet these arts were
disguised by an appearance of military frankness: in his highest
fortune, he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers; and
while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he affected in
his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion of his country. He
grasped with a rapacious, that he might distribute with a liberal, hand:
his primitive indigence had taught the habits of frugality; the gain of
a merchant was not below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured
with slow and unfeeling cruelty, to force a discovery of their secret
treasure. According to the Greeks, he departed from Normandy with only
five followers on horseback and thirty on foot; yet even this allowance
appears too bountiful: the sixth son of Tancred of Hauteville passed
the Alps as a pilgrim; and his first military band was levied among
the adventurers of Italy. His brothers and countrymen had divided the
fertile lands of Apulia; but they guarded their shares with the jealousy
of avarice; the aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of
Calabria, and in his first exploits against the Greeks and the natives,
it is not easy to discriminate the hero from the robber. To surprise
a castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the
adjacent villages for necessary food, were the obscure labors which
formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body. The volunteers of
Normandy adhered to his standard; and, under his command, the peasants
of Calabria assumed the name and character of Normans.

</p>
<p>
As the genius of Robert expanded with his fortune, he awakened the
jealousy of his elder brother, by whom, in a transient quarrel, his life
was threatened and his liberty restrained. After the death of Humphrey,
the tender age of his sons excluded them from the command; they were
reduced to a private estate, by the ambition of their guardian and
uncle; and Guiscard was exalted on a buckler, and saluted count of
Apulia and general of the republic. With an increase of authority and of
force, he resumed the conquest of Calabria, and soon aspired to a rank
that should raise him forever above the heads of his equals.
</p>
<p>
By some acts of rapine or sacrilege, he had incurred a papal
excommunication; but Nicholas the Second was easily persuaded that the
divisions of friends could terminate only in their mutual prejudice;
that the Normans were the faithful champions of the Holy See; and it
was safer to trust the alliance of a prince than the caprice of an
aristocracy. A synod of one hundred bishops was convened at Melphi; and
the count interrupted an important enterprise to guard the person and
execute the decrees of the Roman pontiff. His gratitude and policy
conferred on Robert and his posterity the ducal title, <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> with the
investiture of Apulia, Calabria, and all the lands, both in Italy and
Sicily, which his sword could rescue from the schismatic Greeks and the
unbelieving Saracens. <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> This apostolic sanction might justify his
arms; but the obedience of a free and victorious people could not be
transferred without their consent; and Guiscard dissembled his elevation
till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by the conquest of
Consenza and Reggio. In the hour of triumph, he assembled his troops,
and solicited the Normans to confirm by their suffrage the judgment of
the vicar of Christ: the soldiers hailed with joyful acclamations their
valiant duke; and the counts, his former equals, pronounced the oath
of fidelity with hollow smiles and secret indignation. After this
inauguration, Robert styled himself, "By the grace of God and St. Peter,
duke of Apulia, Calabria, and hereafter of Sicily;" and it was the labor
of twenty years to deserve and realize these lofty appellations. Such
sardy progress, in a narrow space, may seem unworthy of the abilities
of the chief and the spirit of the nation; but the Normans were few in
number; their resources were scanty; their service was voluntary and
precarious. The bravest designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by
the free voice of his parliament of barons: the twelve counts of popular
election conspired against his authority; and against their perfidious
uncle, the sons of Humphrey demanded justice and revenge. By his policy
and vigor, Guiscard discovered their plots, suppressed their rebellions,
and punished the guilty with death or exile: but in these domestic
feuds, his years, and the national strength, were unprofitably consumed.
After the defeat of his foreign enemies, the Greeks, Lombards, and
Saracens, their broken forces retreated to the strong and populous
cities of the sea-coast. They excelled in the arts of fortification and
defence; the Normans were accustomed to serve on horseback in the field,
and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts of persevering
courage. The resistance of Salerno was maintained above eight months;
the siege or blockade of Bari lasted near four years. In these actions
the Norman duke was the foremost in every danger; in every fatigue the
last and most patient. As he pressed the citadel of Salerno, a huge
stone from the rampart shattered one of his military engines; and by
a splinter he was wounded in the breast. Before the gates of Bari, he
lodged in a miserable hut or barrack, composed of dry branches, and
thatched with straw; a perilous station, on all sides open to the
inclemency of the winter and the spears of the enemy. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a>

The Italian conquests of Robert correspond with the limits of the
present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms have
not been dissevered by the revolutions of seven hundred years. <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a>
The monarchy has been composed of the Greek provinces of Calabria and
Apulia, of the Lombard principality of Salerno, the republic of
Amalphi, and the inland dependencies of the large and ancient duchy of
Beneventum. Three districts only were exempted from the common law
of subjection; the first forever, the two last till the middle of the
succeeding century. The city and immediate territory of Benevento had
been transferred, by gift or exchange, from the German emperor to the
Roman pontiff; and although this holy land was sometimes invaded, the
name of St. Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans.
Their first colony of Aversa subdued and held the state of Capua; and
her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace of their
fathers. The dukes of Naples, the present metropolis, maintained the
popular freedom, under the shadow of the Byzantine empire. Among the new
acquisitions of Guiscard, the science of Salerno, <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> and the trade of
Amalphi, <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> may detain for a moment the curiosity of the reader. I. Of
the learned faculties, jurisprudence implies the previous establishment
of laws and property; and theology may perhaps be superseded by the full
light of religion and reason. But the savage and the sage must alike
implore the assistance of physic; and, if our diseases are inflamed by
luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be more frequent in
the ruder ages of society. The treasures of Grecian medicine had been
communicated to the Arabian colonies of Africa, Spain, and Sicily;
and in the intercourse of peace and war, a spark of knowledge had been
kindled and cherished at Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men
were honest and the women beautiful. <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> A school, the first that
arose in the darkness of Europe, was consecrated to the healing art:
the conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and
lucrative profession; and a crowd of patients, of the most eminent rank,
and most distant climates, invited or visited the physicians of Salerno.
They were protected by the Norman conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred
in arms, could discern the merit and value of a philosopher. After a
pilgrimage of thirty-nine years, Constantine, an African Christian,
returned from Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the
Arabians; and Salerno was enriched by the practice, the lessons, and the
writings of the pupil of Avicenna. The school of medicine has long slept
in the name of a university; but her precepts are abridged in a string
of aphorisms, bound together in the Leonine verses, or Latin rhymes, of
the twelfth century. <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> II. Seven miles to the west of Salerno, and
thirty to the south of Naples, the obscure town of Amalphi displayed the
power and rewards of industry. The land, however fertile, was of narrow
extent; but the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants first
assumed the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures
and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the source
of their opulence and freedom. The government was popular, under the
administration of a duke and the supremacy of the Greek emperor. Fifty
thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of Amalphi; nor was any
city more abundantly provided with gold, silver, and the objects of
precious luxury. The mariners who swarmed in her port, excelled in the
theory and practice of navigation and astronomy: and the discovery of
the compass, which has opened the globe, is owing to their ingenuity or
good fortune. Their trade was extended to the coasts, or at least to
the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and India: and their settlements
in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria, acquired the
privileges of independent colonies. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> After three hundred years of
prosperity, Amalphi was oppressed by the arms of the Normans, and
sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but the poverty of one thousand <a href="#note-5111" name="noteref-5111"><small>5111</small></a>
fisherman is yet dignified by the remains of an arsenal, a cathedral,
and the palaces of royal merchants.

<h2>
    Chapter LVI: The Saracens, The Franks And The Normans.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
Roger, the twelfth and last of the sons of Tancred, had been long
detained in Normandy by his own and his father' age. He accepted the
welcome summons; hastened to the Apulian camp; and deserved at first the
esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder brother. Their valor and
ambition were equal; but the youth, the beauty, the elegant manners,
of Roger engaged the disinterested love of the soldiers and people.
So scanty was his allowance for himself and forty followers, that he
descended from conquest to robbery, and from robbery to domestic theft;
and so loose were the notions of property, that, by his own historian,
at his special command, he is accused of stealing horses from a stable
at Melphi. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace: from these
base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy war; and the
invasion of Sicily was seconded by the zeal and policy of his brother
Guiscard. After the retreat of the Greeks, the idolaters, a most
audacious reproach of the Catholics, had retrieved their losses and
possessions; but the deliverance of the island, so vainly undertaken by
the forces of the Eastern empire, was achieved by a small and private
band of adventurers. <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> In the first attempt, Roger braved, in an open
boat, the real and fabulous dangers of Scylla and Charybdis; landed with
only sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the Saracens to the gates
of Messina and safely returned with the spoils of the adjacent country.
In the fortress of Trani, his active and patient courage were equally
conspicuous. In his old age he related with pleasure, that, by the
distress of the siege, himself, and the countess his wife, had been
reduced to a single cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that
in a sally his horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the
Saracens; but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had
retreated with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might
be left in the hands of the miscreants. In the siege of Trani, three
hundred Normans withstood and repulsed the forces of the island. In the
field of Ceramio, fifty thousand horse and foot were overthrown by one
hundred and thirty-six Christian soldiers, without reckoning St. George,
who fought on horseback in the foremost ranks. The captive banners, with
four camels, were reserved for the successor of St. Peter; and had these
barbaric spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol,
they might have revived the memory of the Punic triumphs. These
insufficient numbers of the Normans most probably denote their knights,
the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of whom was attended
by five or six followers in the field; <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> yet, with the aid of this
interpretation, and after every fair allowance on the side of valor,
arms, and reputation, the discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce
the prudent reader to the alternative of a miracle or a fable. The Arabs
of Sicily derived a frequent and powerful succor from their countrymen
of Africa: in the siege of Palermo, the Norman cavalry was assisted by
the galleys of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of the two
brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible emulation. After a
war of thirty years, <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> Roger, with the title of great count,
obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most fruitful island of the
Mediterranean; and his administration displays a liberal and enlightened
mind, above the limits of his age and education. The Moslems were
maintained in the free enjoyment of their religion and property: <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> a
philosopher and physician of Mazara, of the race of Mahomet, harangued
the conqueror, and was invited to court; his geography of the seven
climates was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent perusal,
preferred the work of the Arabian to the writings of the Grecian
Ptolemy. <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> A remnant of Christian natives had promoted the success of
the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of the cross. The island
was restored to the jurisdiction of the Roman pontiff; new bishops
were planted in the principal cities; and the clergy was satisfied by
a liberal endowment of churches and monasteries. Yet the Catholic hero
asserted the rights of the civil magistrate. Instead of resigning the
investiture of benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the
papal claims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged, by
the singular bull, which declares the princes of Sicily hereditary and
perpetual legates of the Holy See. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a>

To Robert Guiscard, the conquest of Sicily was more glorious than
beneficial: the possession of Apulia and Calabria was inadequate to his
ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the first occasion of
invading, perhaps of subduing, the Roman empire of the East. <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> From
his first wife, the partner of his humble fortune, he had been divorced
under the pretence of consanguinity; and her son Bohemond was destined
to imitate, rather than to succeed, his illustrious father. The second
wife of Guiscard was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the
Lombards acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger; their
five daughters were given in honorable nuptials, <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> and one of them
was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a beautiful youth,
the son and heir of the emperor Michael. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> But the throne of
Constantinople was shaken by a revolution: the Imperial family of Ducas
was confined to the palace or the cloister; and Robert deplored, and
resented, the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally.
A Greek, who styled himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared
at Salerno, and related the adventures of his fall and flight. That
unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the
pomp and titles of Imperial dignity: in his triumphal progress through
Apulia and Calabria, Michael <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> was saluted with the tears and
acclamations of the people; and Pope Gregory the Seventh exhorted the
bishops to preach, and the Catholics to fight, in the pious work of his
restoration. His conversations with Robert were frequent and familiar;
and their mutual promises were justified by the valor of the Normans and
the treasures of the East. Yet this Michael, by the confession of the
Greeks and Latins, was a pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled
from his convent, or a domestic who had served in the palace. The fraud
had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after
this pretender had given a decent color to his arms, he would sink, at
the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity. But victory was
the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks; and
the ardor of the Latins was much inferior to their credulity: the Norman
veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils, and the unwarlike
Italians trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine
expedition. In his new levies, Robert exerted the influence of gifts and
promises, the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some
acts of violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy
were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting
prince. After two years' incessant preparations the land and naval
forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme promontory, of
Italy; and Robert was accompanied by his wife, who fought by his
side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of the emperor Michael.
Thirteen hundred knights <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> of Norman race or discipline, formed
the sinews of the army, which might be swelled to thirty thousand <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a>
followers of every denomination. The men, the horses, the arms, the
engines, the wooden towers, covered with raw hides, were embarked on
board one hundred and fifty vessels: the transports had been built in
the ports of Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the
republic of Ragusa.

At the mouth of the Adriatic Gulf, the shores of Italy and Epirus
incline towards each other. The space between Brundusium and Durazzo,
the Roman passage, is no more than one hundred miles; <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> at the last
station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> and this narrow
distance had suggested to Pyrrhus and Pompey the sublime or extravagant
idea of a bridge. Before the general embarkation, the Norman duke
despatched Bohemond with fifteen galleys to seize or threaten the Isle
of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbor in the
neighborhood of Vallona for the landing of the troops. They passed
and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment
displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks. The
islands of Epirus and the maritime towns were subdued by the arms or the
name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from Corfu (I use the modern
appellation) to the siege of Durazzo. That city, the western key of the
empire, was guarded by ancient renown, and recent fortifications, by
George Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious in the Oriental wars, and a
numerous garrison of Albanians and Macedonians, who, in every age,
have maintained the character of soldiers. In the prosecution of his
enterprise, the courage of Guiscard was assailed by every form of danger
and mischance. In the most propitious season of the year, as his fleet
passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow unexpectedly arose:
the Adriatic was swelled by the raging blast of the south, and a new
shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the Acroceraunian rocks. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> The
sails, the masts, and the oars, were shattered or torn away; the sea
and shore were covered with the fragments of vessels, with arms and dead
bodies; and the greatest part of the provisions were either drowned or
damaged. The ducal galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and
Robert halted seven days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of
his loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers. The Normans
were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had explored the
ocean from Greenland to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers
of the Mediterranean. They had wept during the tempest; they were
alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited
by the prayers and promises of the Byzantine court. The first day's
action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a>
who led the naval powers of his father. All night the galleys of the
republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory
of the second day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions, the
station of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed
aid of the Greek fire. The Apulian and Ragusian vessels fled to the
shore, several were cut from their cables, and dragged away by the
conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the
tents of the Norman duke. A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo,
and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the
islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute
and provision. That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease;
five hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; and the list of
burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted to ten thousand
persons. Under these calamities, the mind of Guiscard alone was firm and
invincible; and while he collected new forces from Apulia and Sicily, he
battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo. But his industry
and valor were encountered by equal valor and more perfect industry. A
movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain five hundred soldiers,
had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart: but the descent of
the door or drawbridge was checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden
structure was constantly consumed by artificial flames.

<p>
While the Roman empire was attacked by the Turks in the East, east, and
the Normans in the West, the aged successor of Michael surrendered the
sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the founder
of the Comnenian dynasty. The princess Anne, his daughter and historian,
observes, in her affected style, that even Hercules was unequal to a
double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a hasty peace with
the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of
Durazzo. On his accession, Alexius found the camp without soldiers, and
the treasury without money; yet such were the vigor and activity of his
measures, that in six months he assembled an army of seventy thousand
men, <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> and performed a march of five hundred miles. His troops were
levied in Europe and Asia, from Peloponnesus to the Black Sea; his
majesty was displayed in the silver arms and rich trappings of the
companies of Horse-guards; and the emperor was attended by a train of
nobles and princes, some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed
with the purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a
life of affluence and dignity. Their youthful ardor might animate the
multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were
pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their importunate clamors for
speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who
might have surrounded and starved the besieging army. The enumeration of
provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the
Roman world: the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror;
and the garrisons of Anatolia, or Asia Minor, had been purchased by the
evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the
Turks. The strength of the Greek army consisted in the Varangians, the
Scandinavian guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony
of exiles and volunteers from the British Island of Thule. Under the
yoke of the Norman conqueror, the Danes and English were oppressed
and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land
of slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long
pilgrimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty
and revenge. They were entertained in the service of the Greek emperor;
and their first station was in a new city on the Asiatic shore: but
Alexius soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; and
bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and valor.
<a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> The name of a Norman invader revived the memory of their wrongs:
they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and panted
to regain in Epirus the glory which they had lost in the battle of
Hastings. The Varangians were supported by some companies of Franks or
Latins; and the rebels, who had fled to Constantinople from the tyranny
of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their
revenge. In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the impure
aid of the Paulicians or Manichaeans of Thrace and Bulgaria; and these
heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit and discipline
of active valor. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> The treaty with the sultan had procured a supply
of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the Scythian horse were
opposed to the lances of the Norman cavalry. On the report and distant
prospect of these formidable numbers, Robert assembled a council of his
principal officers. "You behold," said he, "your danger: it is urgent
and inevitable. The hills are covered with arms and standards; and the
emperor of the Greeks is accustomed to wars and triumphs. Obedience and
union are our only safety; and I am ready to yield the command to a more
worthy leader." The vote and acclamation even of his secret enemies,
assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence;
and the duke thus continued: "Let us trust in the rewards of victory,
and deprive cowardice of the means of escape. Let us burn our vessels
and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the
place of our nativity and our burial." The resolution was unanimously
approved; and, without confining himself to his lines, Guiscard awaited
in battle-array the nearer approach of the enemy. His rear was covered
by a small river; his right wing extended to the sea; his left to the
hills: nor was he conscious, perhaps, that on the same ground Caesar and
Pompey had formerly disputed the empire of the world. <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a>

<p>
Against the advice of his wisest captains, Alexius resolved to risk
the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of Durazzo to
assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town. He
marched in two columns to surprise the Normans before daybreak on two
different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the
archers formed the second line; and the Varangians claimed the honors of
the vanguard. In the first onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made
a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which was
now reduced to fifteen thousand men. The Lombards and Calabrians
ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the
sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the
garrison, and the coast was lined with the Venetian galleys, who played
their engines among the disorderly throng. On the verge of ruin, they
were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs. Gaita, the wife of
Robert, is painted by the Greeks as a warlike Amazon, a second Pallas;
less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than the Athenian
goddess: <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> though wounded by an arrow, she stood her ground, and
strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying troops. <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a>
Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of
the Norman duke, as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council:
"Whither," he cried aloud, "whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable;
and death is less grievous than servitude." The moment was decisive: as
the Varangians advanced before the line, they discovered the nakedness
of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight hundred knights,
stood firm and entire; they couched their lances, and the Greeks deplore
the furious and irresistible shock of the French cavalry. <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> Alexius
was not deficient in the duties of a soldier or a general; but he no
sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, and the flight of the
Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired of his fortune. The
princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced
to praise the strength and swiftness of her father's horse, and his
vigorous struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a
lance, which had shivered the Imperial helmet. His desperate valor broke
through a squadron of Franks who opposed his flight; and after wandering
two days and as many nights in the mountains, he found some repose,
of body, though not of mind, in the walls of Lychnidus. The victorious
Robert reproached the tardy and feeble pursuit which had suffered the
escape of so illustrious a prize: but he consoled his disappointment by
the trophies and standards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the
Byzantine camp, and the glory of defeating an army five times more
numerous than his own. A multitude of Italians had been the victims
of their own fears; but only thirty of his knights were slain in
this memorable day. In the Roman host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and
English, amounted to five or six thousand: <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a> the plain of Durazzo was
stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of the impostor Michael
was more honorable than his life.

It is more than probable that Guiscard was not afflicted by the loss of
a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision of
the Greeks. After their defeat, they still persevered in the defence
of Durazzo; and a Venetian commander supplied the place of George
Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station.
The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the
inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison,
Robert insinuated, that his patience was at least equal to their
obstinacy. <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence
with a Venetian noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable
marriage. At the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from
the walls; the light Calabrians ascended in silence; and the Greeks were
awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror. Yet they defended
the streets three days against an enemy already master of the rampart;
and near seven months elapsed between the first investment and the final
surrender of the place. From Durazzo, the Norman duke advanced into the
heart of Epirus or Albania; traversed the first mountains of Thessaly;
surprised three hundred English in the city of Castoria; approached
Thessalonica; and made Constantinople tremble. A more pressing duty
suspended the prosecution of his ambitious designs. By shipwreck,
pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a third of the
original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he was
informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers which had
been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities and barons of
Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach or invasion of Henry
king of Germany. Highly presuming that his person was sufficient for the
public safety, he repassed the sea in a single brigantine, and left the
remains of the army under the command of his son and the Norman counts,
exhorting Bohemond to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts
to obey the authority of their leader. The son of Guiscard trod in the
footsteps of his father; and the two destroyers are compared, by the
Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours

battles against the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly,
and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> which
contained the treasure and magazines of the Byzantine camp. Yet a just
praise must not be refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who
bravely struggled with the calamities of the times. In the poverty
of the state, he presumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the
churches: the desertion of the Manichaeans was supplied by some tribes
of Moldavia: a reenforcement of seven thousand Turks replaced and
revenged the loss of their brethren; and the Greek soldiers were
exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of
ambuscades and evolutions. Alexius had been taught by experience, that
the formidable cavalry of the Franks on foot was unfit for action, and
almost incapable of motion; <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> his archers were directed to aim their
arrows at the horse rather than the man; and a variety of spikes and
snares were scattered over the ground on which he might expect an
attack. In the neighborhood of Larissa the events of war were protracted
and balanced. The courage of Bohemond was always conspicuous, and often
successful; but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the
city was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted
his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the
emperor. Alexius returned to Constantinople with the advantage, rather
than the honor, of victory. After evacuating the conquests which he
could no longer defend, the son of Guiscard embarked for Italy, and
was embraced by a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his
misfortune.

<h2>
    Chapter LVI: The Saracens, The Franks And The Normans.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
Of the Latin princes, the allies of Alexius and enemies of Robert, the
most prompt and powerful was Henry the Third or Fourth, king of Germany
and Italy, and future emperor of the West. The epistle of the Greek
monarch <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> to his brother is filled with the warmest professions of
friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their alliance
by every public and private tie. He congratulates Henry on his success
in a just and pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own
empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the Norman Robert.
The lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age&mdash;a radiated
crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a case of
relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase of crystal, a
vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and one hundred
pieces of purple. To these he added a more solid present, of one hundred
and forty-four thousand Byzantines of gold, with a further assurance of
two hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as Henry should have entered
in arms the Apulian territories, and confirmed by an oath the league
against the common enemy. The German, <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a> who was already in Lombardy
at the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers,
and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound of the
battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty
return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the Grecian bribe. Henry was
the severe adversary of the Normans, the allies and vassals of Gregory
the Seventh, his implacable foe. The long quarrel of the throne and
mitre had been recently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty
priest: <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> the king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had
seated a rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
After the defeat and death of his Swabian rebel, Henry descended into
Italy, to assume the Imperial crown, and to drive from the Vatican the
tyrant of the church. <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> But the Roman people adhered to the cause
of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money
from Apulia; and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the
king of Germany. In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with
Byzantine gold, the nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been
ruined by the war. The gates, the bridges, and fifty hostages, were
delivered into his hands: the anti-pope, Clement the Third, was
consecrated in the Lateran: the grateful pontiff crowned his protector
in the Vatican; and the emperor Henry fixed his residence in the
Capitol, as the lawful successor of Augustus and Charlemagne. The ruins
of the Septizonium were still defended by the nephew of Gregory: the
pope himself was invested in the castle of St. Angelo; and his last hope
was in the courage and fidelity of his Norman vassal. Their friendship
had been interrupted by some reciprocal injuries and complaints; but,
on this pressing occasion, Guiscard was urged by the obligation of his
oath, by his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and
his enmity to the two emperors. Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved
to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of
his armies, six thousand horse, and thirty thousand foot, was instantly
assembled; and his march from Salerno to Rome was animated by the public
applause and the promise of the divine favor. Henry, invincible
in sixty-six battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some
indispensable affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted
the Romans to persevere in their allegiance; and hastily retreated three
days before the entrance of the Normans. In less than three years, the
son of Tancred of Hauteville enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope,
and of compelling the two emperors, of the East and West, to fly before
his victorious arms. <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> But the triumph of Robert was clouded by the
calamities of Rome. By the aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had
been perforated or scaled; but the Imperial faction was still powerful
and active; on the third day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and
a hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal
of fire and pillage. <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> The Saracens of Sicily, the subjects of Roger,
and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling
and profaning the holy city of the Christians: many thousands of the
citizens, in the sight, and by the allies, of their spiritual father
were exposed to violation, captivity, or death; and a spacious quarter
of the city, from the Lateran to the Coliseum, was consumed by the
flames, and devoted to perpetual solitude. <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a> From a city, where he
was now hated, and might be no longer feared, Gregory retired to end
his days in the palace of Salerno. The artful pontiff might flatter the
vanity of Guiscard with the hope of a Roman or Imperial crown; but this
dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the Norman,
must forever have alienated the most faithful princes of Germany.

</p>
<p>
The deliverer and scourge of Rome might have indulged himself in a
season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the German
emperor, the indefatigable Robert resumed the design of his eastern
conquests. The zeal or gratitude of Gregory had promised to his valor
the kingdoms of Greece and Asia; <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> his troops were assembled in
arms, flushed with success, and eager for action. Their numbers, in the
language of Homer, are compared by Anna to a swarm of bees; <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> yet the
utmost and moderate limits of the powers of Guiscard have been already
defined; they were contained on this second occasion in one hundred
and twenty vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbor of
Brundusium <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a> was preferred to the open road of Otranto. Alexius,
apprehensive of a second attack, had assiduously labored to restore the
naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the republic of Venice an
important succor of thirty-six transports, fourteen galleys, and
nine galiots or ships of extra-ordinary strength and magnitude. Their
services were liberally paid by the license or monopoly of trade, a
profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople,
and a tribute to St. Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce
of a tax on their rivals at Amalphi. By the union of the Greeks and
Venetians, the Adriatic was covered with a hostile fleet; but their
own neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the
shelter of a mist, opened a free passage; and the Norman troops were
safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus. With twenty strong and
well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought the
enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his
own life, and the lives of his brother and two sons, to the event of a
naval combat. The dominion of the sea was disputed in three engagements,
in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in the two former, the skill and numbers
of the allies were superior; but in the third, the Normans obtained a
final and complete victory. <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a> The light brigantines of the Greeks
were scattered in ignominious flight: the nine castles of the Venetians
maintained a more obstinate conflict; seven were sunk, two were taken;
two thousand five hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the
victor; and the daughter of Alexius deplores the loss of thirteen
thousand of his subjects or allies. The want of experience had been
supplied by the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had
sounded a retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and
invented new methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the
advantages of the enemy. The winter season suspended his progress: with
the return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople;
but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms
against Greece and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labor,
and where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations
with vigor and effect. But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects
were fatally blasted by an epidemical disease: Robert himself, in the
seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion of
poison was imputed, by public rumor, to his wife, or to the Greek
emperor. <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> This premature death might allow a boundless scope for the
imagination of his future exploits; and the event sufficiently declares,
that the Norman greatness was founded on his life. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> Without the
appearance of an enemy, a victorious army dispersed or retreated in
disorder and consternation; and Alexius, who had trembled for his
empire, rejoiced in his deliverance. The galley which transported the
remains of Guiscard was ship-wrecked on the Italian shore; but the
duke's body was recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre
of Venusia, <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> a place more illustrious for the birth of Horace <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a>
than for the burial of the Norman heroes. Roger, his second son and
successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia:
the esteem or partiality of his father left the valiant Bohemond to the
inheritance of his sword.

Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and
soon bounded by the sepulchre. The male line of Robert Guiscard was
extinguished, both in Apulia and at Antioch, in the second generation;
but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the
son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and the
spirit, of the first Roger. <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> The heir of that Norman adventurer was
born in Sicily; and, at the age of only four years, he succeeded to
the sovereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she
indulge for a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion.
Had Roger been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful
people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration
could have restored the prosperous times of the Greek colonies, <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> the
opulence and power of Sicily alone might have equalled the widest
scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war. But the
ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it
was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice. He sought to
obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which one moiety had been
ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his Calabrian limits
beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched the
declining health of his cousin William of Apulia, the grandson of
Robert. On the first intelligence of his premature death, Roger sailed
from Palermo with seven galleys, cast anchor in the Bay of Salerno,
received, after ten days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the
Norman capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a
legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure
either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal. The sacred spot
of Benevento was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St. Peter;
but the reduction of Capua and Naples completed the design of his uncle
Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the Norman conquests was possessed
by the victorious Roger. A conscious superiority of power and merit
prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; and the Isle of
Sicily, with a third perhaps of the continent of Italy, might form the
basis of a kingdom <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> which would only yield to the monarchies of
France and England. The chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation
at Palermo might doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign
over them; but the example of a Greek tyrant or a Saracen emir was
insufficient to justify his regal character; and the nine kings of the
Latin world <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> might disclaim their new associate, unless he were
consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff. The pride of
Anacletus was pleased to confer a title, which the pride of the Norman
had stooped to solicit; <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> but his own legitimacy was attacked by the
adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while Anacletus sat in
the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by the nations of
Europe. The infant monarchy of Roger was shaken, and almost overthrown,
by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of
Lothaire the Second of Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the
fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St. Bernard, were united for the ruin of
the Sicilian robber. After a gallant resistance, the Norman prince was
driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of Apulia was invested by
the pope and the emperor, each of whom held one end of the gonfanon,
or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted their right, and suspended
their quarrel. But such jealous friendship was of short and precarious
duration: the German armies soon vanished in disease and desertion:
<a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> the Apulian duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a
conqueror who seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his
predecessor Leo the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff became
the captive and friend of the Normans; and their reconciliation was
celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who now revered the title and
virtues of the king of Sicily.

As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St. Peter,
that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross,
and he accomplished with ardor a vow so propitious to his interest and
revenge. The recent injuries of Sicily might provoke a just retaliation
on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been mingled
with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate
the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their
strength they contended with the decline of an African power. When the
Fatimite caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded the real
merit and apparent fidelity of his servant Joseph with a gift of his
royal mantle, and forty Arabian horses, his palace with its sumptuous
furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of Tunis and Algiers. The
Zeirides, <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegiance and
gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of
prosperity; and after running the little course of an Oriental dynasty,
were now fainting in their own weakness. On the side of the land, they
were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco, while
the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the Greeks and Franks, who,
before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted a ransom of two
hundred thousand pieces of gold. By the first arms of Roger, the island
or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a military and
religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily.
Tripoli, <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> a strong and maritime city, was the next object of his
attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females,
might be justified by the frequent practice of the Moslems themselves.
The capital of the Zeirides was named Africa from the country, and
Mahadia <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> from the Arabian founder: it is strongly built on a neck
of land, but the imperfection of the harbor is not compensated by the
fertility of the adjacent plain. Mahadia was besieged by George the
Sicilian admiral, with a fleet of one hundred and fifty galleys, amply
provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the sovereign had
fled, the Moorish governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and
irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the Moslem inhabitants
abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks. In
successive expeditions, the king of Sicily or his lieutenants reduced
the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of the
sea-coast; <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was
tributary, and a boast that it held Africa in subjection might be
inscribed with some flattery on the sword of Roger. <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a> After his
death, that sword was broken; and these transmarine possessions
were neglected, evacuated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his
successor. <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> The triumphs of Scipio and Belisarius have proved, that
the African continent is neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the
great princes and powers of Christendom have repeatedly failed in their
armaments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest
and long servitude of Spain.

the admiral Majo.]
</p>
<p>
Since the decease of Robert Guiscard, the Normans had relinquished,
above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East.
The policy of Roger solicited a public and private union with the Greek
princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded
in marriage a daughter of the Comnenian family, and the first steps of
the treaty seemed to promise a favorable event. But the contemptuous
treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch;
and the insolence of the Byzantine court was expiated, according to the
laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people. <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> With the
fleet of seventy galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily, appeared before
Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his hands by the
disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege is still
more calamitous than a tribute. In this invasion, of some moment in the
annals of commerce, the Normans spread themselves by sea, and over
the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and
Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty. Of the wrongs of Athens,
no memorial remains. The ancient walls, which encompassed, without
guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the Latin Christians;
but their sole use of the gospel was to sanctify an oath, that the
lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or
industry. On the approach of the Normans, the lower town of Corinth
was evacuated; the Greeks retired to the citadel, which was seated on a
lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene;
an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by any
advantages of art or nature. As soon as the besiegers had surmounted the
labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill, their general, from
the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and testified his
gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from the altar the precious image of
Theodore, the tutelary saint. The silk weavers of both sexes, whom
George transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the
spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the
sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the
distaff and loom were the only weapons which the Greeks were capable of
using. The progress of this naval armament was marked by two conspicuous
events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the
Byzantine capital. In his return by sea from an unfortunate crusade,
Louis the Seventh was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely violated the
laws of honor and religion. The fortunate encounter of the Norman
fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and honorable
entertainment in the court of Sicily, Louis continued his journey to
Rome and Paris. <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> In the absence of the emperor, Constantinople and
the Hellespont were left without defence and without the suspicion
of danger. The clergy and people (for the soldiers had followed
the standard of Manuel) were astonished and dismayed at the hostile
appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front
of the Imperial city. The forces of the Sicilian admiral were inadequate
to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but
George enjoyed the glory of humbling the Greek arrogance, and of marking
the path of conquest to the navies of the West. He landed some soldiers
to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silver, or
most probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged against the
palace of the Caesars. <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a> This playful outrage of the pirates of
Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded moment, Manuel affected to
despise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were
awakened to revenge. The Archipelago and Ionian Sea were covered with
his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favorable
allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or
even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of fifteen
hundred vessels, which is proposed by a Byzantine historian. These
operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward
voyage George lost nineteen of his galleys, which were separated and
taken: after an obstinate defence, Corfu implored the clemency of her
lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the Norman prince, be
found, unless as a captive, within the limits of the Eastern empire. The
prosperity and the health of Roger were already in a declining state:
while he listened in his palace of Palermo to the messengers of victory
or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was
celebrated by the Greeks and Latins as the Alexander or the Hercules of
the age.

    Chapter LVI: The Saracens, The Franks And The Normans.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>
<p>
A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled
the insolence of a Barbarian. It was the right and duty, it might be
the interest and glory, of Manuel to restore the ancient majesty of the
empire, to recover the provinces of Italy and Sicily, and to chastise
this pretended king, the grandson of a Norman vassal. <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> The natives
of Calabria were still attached to the Greek language and worship, which
had been inexorably proscribed by the Latin clergy: after the loss of
her dukes, Apulia was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of
Sicily; the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his
death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his
subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of
rebellion; and a nephew of Roger himself invited the enemies of his
family and nation. The majesty of the purple, and a series of Hungarian
and Turkish wars, prevented Manuel from embarking his person in the
Italian expedition. To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant,
the Greek monarch intrusted a fleet and army: the siege of Bari was his
first exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was the
instrument of victory. Salerno, and some places along the western
coast, maintained their fidelity to the Norman king; but he lost in
two campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the
modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content
with the reduction of three hundred cities or villages of Apulia and
Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of
the palace. The prejudices of the Latins were gratified by a genuine or
fictitious donation under the seal of the German Caesars; <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> but
the successor of Constantine soon renounced this ignominious pretence,
claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of
chasing the Barbarians beyond the Alps. By the artful speeches, liberal
gifts, and unbounded promises, of their Eastern ally, the free cities
were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the
despotism of Frederic Barbarossa: the walls of Milan were rebuilt by the
contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river
of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the Greeks was
fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians. <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> The situation
and trade of Ancona rendered it an important garrison in the heart
of Italy: it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial
forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was
animated by the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid
patriots, the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and
honors of the Byzantine court. <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> The pride of Manuel disdained and
rejected a Barbarian colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of
stripping the purple from the German usurpers, and of establishing,
in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the
Romans. With this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the
bishop of Rome. Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the Greek
monarch; the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured
the support of that powerful family, <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> and his royal standard or
image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis.
<a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> During the quarrel between Frederic and Alexander the Third, the
pope twice received in the Vatican the ambassadors of Constantinople.
They flattered his piety by the long-promised union of the two churches,
tempted the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the Roman pontiff
to seize the just provocation, the favorable moment, to humble
the savage insolence of the Alemanni and to acknowledge the true
representative of Constantine and Augustus. <a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a>

<p>
But these Italian conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from the
hand of the Greek emperor. His first demands were eluded by the
prudence of Alexander the Third, who paused on this deep and momentous
revolution; <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a> nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dispute to
renounce the perpetual inheritance of the Latin name. After the reunion
with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, confirmed the
acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of Manuel,
and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least the
empires, of Constantinople and Rome. <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> The free cities of Lombardy
no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without preserving
the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of Venice. <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a>
By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the Greek emperor
was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the effects, of the
Venetian merchants. This violation of the public faith exasperated a
free and commercial people: one hundred galleys were launched and armed
in as many days; they swept the coasts of Dalmatia and Greece: but after
some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement, inglorious
to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a complete vengeance
of these and of fresh injuries was reserved for the succeeding
generation. The lieutenant of Manuel had informed his sovereign that he
was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt of Apulia and Calabria;
but that his forces were inadequate to resist the impending attack
of the king of Sicily. His prophecy was soon verified: the death of
Palaeologus devolved the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in
rank, alike defective in military talents; the Greeks were oppressed
by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the
Normans and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the person or
dominions of their conqueror. <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> Yet the king of Sicily esteemed the
courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed a second army on the
Italian shore; he respectfully addressed the new Justinian; solicited a
peace or truce of thirty years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and
acknowledged himself the military vassal of the Roman empire. <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a>
The Byzantine Caesars acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without
expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a Norman army; and
the truce of thirty years was not disturbed by any hostilities between
Sicily and Constantinople. About the end of that period, the throne of
Manuel was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence
of his country and mankind: the sword of William the Second, the
grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive of the Comnenian race; and
the subjects of Andronicus might salute the strangers as friends,
since they detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies. The Latin
historians <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a> expatiate on the rapid progress of the four counts
who invaded Romania with a fleet and army, and reduced many castles and
cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily. The Greeks <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a> accuse
and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruelties that were perpetrated
in the sack of Thessalonica, the second city of the empire. The former
deplore the fate of those invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were
destroyed by the arts of a vanquished foe. The latter applaud, in songs
of triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of
Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the walls
of Durazzo. A revolution which punished the crimes of Andronicus,
had united against the Franks the zeal and courage of the successful
insurgents: ten thousand were slain in battle, and Isaac Angelus, the
new emperor, might indulge his vanity or vengeance in the treatment of
four thousand captives. Such was the event of the last contest between
the Greeks and Normans: before the expiration of twenty years, the rival
nations were lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors
of Constantine did not long survive to insult the fall of the Sicilian
monarchy.

The sceptre of Roger successively devolved to his son and grandson:
they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly
discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these
epithets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue,
cannot strictly be applied to either of the Norman princes. When he was
roused to arms by danger and shame, the first William did not degenerate
from the valor of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners
were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the monarch
is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of Majo,
the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired against the
life, of his benefactor. From the Arabian conquest, Sicily had imbibed a
deep tincture of Oriental manners; the despotism, the pomp, and even the
harem, of a sultan; and a Christian people was oppressed and insulted
by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly
cherished, the religion of Mahomet. An eloquent historian of the times
<a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> has delineated the misfortunes of his country: <a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a> the ambition
and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his
assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself; the
private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the various
forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, the island, and
the continent, during the reign of William the First, and the minority
of his son. The youth, innocence, and beauty of William the Second,
<a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; the
laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death of that
amiable prince, Sicily enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and
happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past
and the dread of futurity. The legitimate male posterity of Tancred
of Hauteville was extinct in the person of the second William; but his
aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince of the
age; and Henry the Sixth, the son of Frederic Barbarossa, descended from
the Alps to claim the Imperial crown and the inheritance of his wife.
Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheritance could only
be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense
of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot,
with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
"Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in the
pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners, of this
fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the Barbarians with our
treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to contaminate the
beauties of her venerable parent. Already I behold the swarms of angry
Barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourishing in a long peace,
are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and
polluted by intemperance and lust. I see the massacre or captivity
of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons. <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a> In this
extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the Sicilians act? By
the unanimous election of a king of valor and experience, Sicily
and Calabria might yet be preserved; <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> for in the levity of
the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither
confidence nor hope. <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a> Should Calabria be lost, the lofty towers,
the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of Messina, <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a> might
guard the passage against a foreign invader. If the savage Germans
coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if they destroy with fire the
fruitful region, so often wasted by the fires of Mount Aetna, <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> what
resource will be left for the interior parts of the island, these noble
cities which should never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a
Barbarian? <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a> Catana has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the
ancient virtue of Syracuse expires in poverty and solitude; <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a> but
Palermo is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls enclose the
active multitudes of Christians and Saracens. If the two nations,
under one king, can unite for their common safety, they may rush on
the Barbarians with invincible arms. But if the Saracens, fatigued by
a repetition of injuries, should now retire and rebel; if they should
occupy the castles of the mountains and sea-coast, the unfortunate
Christians, exposed to a double attack, and placed as it were between
the hammer and the anvil, must resign themselves to hopeless and
inevitable servitude." <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a> We must not forget, that a priest here
prefers his country to his religion; and that the Moslems, whose
alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the state of
Sicily.

extends from 1154 to 1169, is inserted in the viiith volume of
Muratori's Collection, (tom. vii. p. 259-344,) and preceded by a
eloquent preface or epistle, (p. 251-258, de Calamitatibus Siciliae.)
Falcandus has been styled the Tacitus of Sicily; and, after a just, but
immense, abatement, from the ist to the xiith century, from a senator to
a monk, I would not strip him of his title: his narrative is rapid and
perspicuous, his style bold and elegant, his observation keen; he had
studied mankind, and feels like a man. I can only regret the narrow and
barren field on which his labors have been cast.]

Foucault. According to them, Hugues Foucalt, a Frenchman by birth,
and at length abbot of St. Denys, had followed into Sicily his patron
Stephen de la Perche, uncle to the mother of William II., archbishop of
Palermo, and great chancellor of the kingdom. Yet Falcandus has all the
feelings of a Sicilian; and the title of Alumnus (which he bestows on
himself) appears to indicate that he was born, or at least educated, in
the island.]

The hopes, or at least the wishes, of Falcandus were at first gratified
by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the first
king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military virtues
shone without a blemish. During four years, the term of his life and
reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the Apulian frontier,
against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive,
of Constantia herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass
the most liberal measure of policy or reason. After his decease, the
kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and Henry
pursued his victorious march from Capua to Palermo. The political
balance of Italy was destroyed by his success; and if the pope and the
free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they would
have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the dangerous
union of the German empire with the kingdom of Sicily. But the subtle
policy, for which the Vatican has so often been praised or arraigned,
was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true that
Celestine the Third had kicked away the Imperial crown from the head
of the prostrate Henry, <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a> such an act of impotent pride could serve
only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy. The Genoese, who
enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to the
promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a> their
fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbor of
Palermo; and the first act of his government was to abolish the
privileges, and to seize the property, of these imprudent allies. The
last hope of Falcandus was defeated by the discord of the Christians and
Mahometans: they fought in the capital; several thousands of the latter
were slain; but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and
disturbed above thirty years the peace of the island. By the policy of
Frederic the Second, sixty thousand Saracens were transplanted to Nocera
in Apulia. In their wars against the Roman church, the emperor and
his son Mainfroy were strengthened and disgraced by the service of the
enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained their religion
and manners in the heart of Italy, till they were extirpated, at the
end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the house of
Anjou. <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a> All the calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored
were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the German conqueror. He
violated the royal sepulchres, <a href="#note-1391" name="noteref-1391"><small>1391</small></a> and explored the secret treasures
of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and jewels,
however precious, might be easily removed; but one hundred and sixty
horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily. <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a> The young
king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were
separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps; and, on the slightest
rumor of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their
eyes, or of the hope of posterity. Constantia herself was touched with
sympathy for the miseries of her country; and the heiress of the Norman
line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the
patrimony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age
under the name of Frederic the Second. Ten years after this revolution,
the French monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Normandy: the
sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a granddaughter of
William the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous
Normans, who had raised so many trophies in France, England, and
Ireland, in Apulia, Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory
or servitude, among the vanquished nations.
