About twenty years after the conquest of Jerusalem by the Turks, the
holy sepulchre was visited by a hermit of the name of Peter, a native
of Amiens, in the province of Picardy <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> in France. His resentment
and sympathy were excited by his own injuries and the oppression of the
Christian name; he mingled his tears with those of the patriarch, and
earnestly inquired, if no hopes of relief could be entertained from the
Greek emperors of the East. The patriarch exposed the vices and weakness
of the successors of Constantine. "I will rouse," exclaimed the hermit,
"the martial nations of Europe in your cause;" and Europe was obedient
to the call of the hermit. The astonished patriarch dismissed him with
epistles of credit and complaint; and no sooner did he land at Bari,
than Peter hastened to kiss the feet of the Roman pontiff. His stature
was small, his appearance contemptible; but his eye was keen and lively;
and he possessed that vehemence of speech, which seldom fails to impart
the persuasion of the soul. <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> He was born of a gentleman's family,
(for we must now adopt a modern idiom,) and his military service was
under the neighboring counts of Boulogne, the heroes of the first
crusade. But he soon relinquished the sword and the world; and if it
be true, that his wife, however noble, was aged and ugly, he might
withdraw, with the less reluctance, from her bed to a convent, and at
length to a hermitage. <a href="#note-211" name="noteref-211"><small>211</small></a> In this austere solitude, his body was
emaciated, his fancy was inflamed; whatever he wished, he believed;
whatever he believed, he saw in dreams and revelations. From Jerusalem
the pilgrim returned an accomplished fanatic; but as he excelled in the
popular madness of the times, Pope Urban the Second received him as
a prophet, applauded his glorious design, promised to support it in a
general council, and encouraged him to proclaim the deliverance of the
Holy Land. Invigorated by the approbation of the pontiff, his zealous
missionary traversed. with speed and success, the provinces of Italy and
France. His diet was abstemious, his prayers long and fervent, and the
alms which he received with one hand, he distributed with the other: his
head was bare, his feet naked, his meagre body was wrapped in a coarse
garment; he bore and displayed a weighty crucifix; and the ass on which
he rode was sanctified, in the public eye, by the service of the man of
God. He preached to innumerable crowds in the churches, the streets, and
the highways: the hermit entered with equal confidence the palace and
the cottage; and the people (for all was people) was impetuously moved
by his call to repentance and arms. When he painted the sufferings
of the natives and pilgrims of Palestine, every heart was melted to
compassion; every breast glowed with indignation, when he challenged the
warriors of the age to defend their brethren, and rescue their Savior:
his ignorance of art and language was compensated by sighs, and tears,
and ejaculations; and Peter supplied the deficiency of reason by loud
and frequent appeals to Christ and his mother, to the saints and angels
of paradise, with whom he had personally conversed. <a href="#note-212" name="noteref-212"><small>212</small></a> The most
perfect orator of Athens might have envied the success of his eloquence;
the rustic enthusiast inspired the passions which he felt, and
Christendom expected with impatience the counsels and decrees of the
supreme pontiff.

The magnanimous spirit of Gregory the Seventh had already embraced the
design of arming Europe against Asia; the ardor of his zeal and ambition
still breathes in his epistles: from either side of the Alps, fifty
thousand Catholics had enlisted under the banner of St. Peter; <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> and
his successor reveals his intention of marching at their head against
the impious sectaries of Mahomet. But the glory or reproach of
executing, though not in person, this holy enterprise, was reserved for
Urban the Second, <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> the most faithful of his disciples. He undertook
the conquest of the East, whilst the larger portion of Rome was
possessed and fortified by his rival Guibert of Ravenna, who contended
with Urban for the name and honors of the pontificate. He attempted to
unite the powers of the West, at a time when the princes were
separated from the church, and the people from their princes, by the
excommunication which himself and his predecessors had thundered
against the emperor and the king of France. Philip the First, of France,
supported with patience the censures which he had provoked by his
scandalous life and adulterous marriage. Henry the Fourth, of Germany,
asserted the right of investitures, the prerogative of confirming his
bishops by the delivery of the ring and crosier. But the emperor's
party was crushed in Italy by the arms of the Normans and the Countess
Mathilda; and the long quarrel had been recently envenomed by the revolt
of his son Conrad and the shame of his wife, <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> who, in the synods of
Constance and Placentia, confessed the manifold prostitutions to which
she had been exposed by a husband regardless of her honor and his own.
<a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> So popular was the cause of Urban, so weighty was his influence,
that the council which he summoned at Placentia <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> was composed of two
hundred bishops of Italy, France, Burgandy, Swabia, and Bavaria. Four
thousand of the clergy, and thirty thousand of the laity, attended this
important meeting; and, as the most spacious cathedral would have been
inadequate to the multitude, the session of seven days was held in
a plain adjacent to the city. The ambassadors of the Greek emperor,
Alexius Comnenus, were introduced to plead the distress of their
sovereign, and the danger of Constantinople, which was divided only by
a narrow sea from the victorious Turks, the common enemies of the
Christian name. In their suppliant address they flattered the pride of
the Latin princes; and, appealing at once to their policy and religion,
exhorted them to repel the Barbarians on the confines of Asia, rather
than to expect them in the heart of Europe. At the sad tale of the
misery and perils of their Eastern brethren, the assembly burst into
tears; the most eager champions declared their readiness to march; and
the Greek ambassadors were dismissed with the assurance of a speedy and
powerful succor. The relief of Constantinople was included in the
larger and most distant project of the deliverance of Jerusalem; but the
prudent Urban adjourned the final decision to a second synod, which he
proposed to celebrate in some city of France in the autumn of the same
year. The short delay would propagate the flame of enthusiasm; and
his firmest hope was in a nation of soldiers <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> still proud of
the preeminence of their name, and ambitious to emulate their hero
Charlemagne, <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> who, in the popular romance of Turpin, <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> had
achieved the conquest of the Holy Land. A latent motive of affection or
vanity might influence the choice of Urban: he was himself a native of
France, a monk of Clugny, and the first of his countrymen who ascended
the throne of St. Peter. The pope had illustrated his family and
province; nor is there perhaps a more exquisite gratification than to
revisit, in a conspicuous dignity, the humble and laborious scenes of
our youth.

773. After the year 1000, this romance was composed in his name, by
a monk of the borders of France and Spain; and such was the idea of
ecclesiastical merit, that he describes himself as a fighting and
drinking priest! Yet the book of lies was pronounced authentic by Pope
Calixtus II., (A.D. 1122,) and is respectfully quoted by the abbot
Suger, in the great Chronicles of St. Denys, (Fabric Bibliot. Latin
Medii Aevi, edit. Mansi, tom. iv. p. 161.)]
</p>
<p>
It may occasion some surprise that the Roman pontiff should erect, in
the heart of France, the tribunal from whence he hurled his anathemas
against the king; but our surprise will vanish so soon as we form a just
estimate of a king of France of the eleventh century. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> Philip the
First was the great-grandson of Hugh Capet, the founder of the present
race, who, in the decline of Charlemagne's posterity, added the regal
title to his patrimonial estates of Paris and Orleans. In this narrow
compass, he was possessed of wealth and jurisdiction; but in the rest
of France, Hugh and his first descendants were no more than the feudal
lords of about sixty dukes and counts, of independent and hereditary
power, <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> who disdained the control of laws and legal assemblies, and
whose disregard of their sovereign was revenged by the disobedience of
their inferior vassals. At Clermont, in the territories of the count
of Auvergne, <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> the pope might brave with impunity the resentment
of Philip; and the council which he convened in that city was not less
numerous or respectable than the synod of Placentia. <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> Besides his
court and council of Roman cardinals, he was supported by thirteen
archbishops and two hundred and twenty-five bishops: the number of
mitred prelates was computed at four hundred; and the fathers of the
church were blessed by the saints and enlightened by the doctors of the
age. From the adjacent kingdoms, a martial train of lords and knights of
power and renown attended the council, <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> in high expectation of its
resolves; and such was the ardor of zeal and curiosity, that the city
was filled, and many thousands, in the month of November, erected their
tents or huts in the open field. A session of eight days produced some
useful or edifying canons for the reformation of manners; a severe
censure was pronounced against the license of private war; the Truce of
God <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> was confirmed, a suspension of hostilities during four days
of the week; women and priests were placed under the safeguard of the
church; and a protection of three years was extended to husbandmen
and merchants, the defenceless victims of military rapine. But a law,
however venerable be the sanction, cannot suddenly transform the temper
of the times; and the benevolent efforts of Urban deserve the less
praise, since he labored to appease some domestic quarrels that he might
spread the flames of war from the Atlantic to the Euphrates. From the
synod of Placentia, the rumor of his great design had gone forth among
the nations: the clergy on their return had preached in every diocese
the merit and glory of the deliverance of the Holy Land; and when the
pope ascended a lofty scaffold in the market-place of Clermont, his
eloquence was addressed to a well-prepared and impatient audience.
His topics were obvious, his exhortation was vehement, his success
inevitable. The orator was interrupted by the shout of thousands, who
with one voice, and in their rustic idiom, exclaimed aloud, "God wills
it, God wills it." <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> "It is indeed the will of God," replied the
pope; "and let this memorable word, the inspiration surely of the
Holy Spirit, be forever adopted as your cry of battle, to animate the
devotion and courage of the champions of Christ. His cross is the symbol
of your salvation; wear it, a red, a bloody cross, as an external mark,
on your breasts or shoulders, as a pledge of your sacred and irrevocable
engagement." The proposal was joyfully accepted; great numbers, both of
the clergy and laity, impressed on their garments the sign of the cross,
<a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> and solicited the pope to march at their head. This dangerous honor
was declined by the more prudent successor of Gregory, who alleged
the schism of the church, and the duties of his pastoral office,
recommending to the faithful, who were disqualified by sex or
profession, by age or infirmity, to aid, with their prayers and alms,
the personal service of their robust brethren. The name and powers
of his legate he devolved on Adhemar bishop of Puy, the first who had
received the cross at his hands. The foremost of the temporal chiefs was
Raymond count of Thoulouse, whose ambassadors in the council excused the
absence, and pledged the honor, of their master. After the confession
and absolution of their sins, the champions of the cross were dismissed
with a superfluous admonition to invite their countrymen and friends;
and their departure for the Holy Land was fixed to the festival of the
Assumption, the fifteenth of August, of the ensuing year. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a>

So familiar, and as it were so natural to man, is the practice of
violence, that our indulgence allows the slightest provocation, the most
disputable right, as a sufficient ground of national hostility. But the
name and nature of a holy war demands a more rigorous scrutiny; nor
can we hastily believe, that the servants of the Prince of Peace would
unsheathe the sword of destruction, unless the motive were pure, the
quarrel legitimate, and the necessity inevitable. The policy of an
action may be determined from the tardy lessons of experience; but,
before we act, our conscience should be satisfied of the justice and
propriety of our enterprise. In the age of the crusades, the Christians,
both of the East and West, were persuaded of their lawfulness and merit;
their arguments are clouded by the perpetual abuse of Scripture and
rhetoric; but they seem to insist on the right of natural and religious
defence, their peculiar title to the Holy Land, and the impiety of their
Pagan and Mahometan foes. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a>
</p>
<p>
I. The right of a just defence may fairly include our civil and
spiritual allies: it depends on the existence of danger; and that danger
must be estimated by the twofold consideration of the malice, and
the power, of our enemies. A pernicious tenet has been imputed to the
Mahometans, the duty of extirpating all other religions by the sword.
This charge of ignorance and bigotry is refuted by the Koran, by the
history of the Mussulman conquerors, and by their public and legal
toleration of the Christian worship. But it cannot be denied, that the
Oriental churches are depressed under their iron yoke; that, in peace
and war, they assert a divine and indefeasible claim of universal
empire; and that, in their orthodox creed, the unbelieving nations are
continually threatened with the loss of religion or liberty. In the
eleventh century, the victorious arms of the Turks presented a real
and urgent apprehension of these losses. They had subdued, in less
than thirty years, the kingdoms of Asia, as far as Jerusalem and the
Hellespont; and the Greek empire tottered on the verge of destruction.
Besides an honest sympathy for their brethren, the Latins had a right
and interest in the support of Constantinople, the most important
barrier of the West; and the privilege of defence must reach to prevent,
as well as to repel, an impending assault. But this salutary purpose
might have been accomplished by a moderate succor; and our calmer
reason must disclaim the innumerable hosts, and remote operations, which
overwhelmed Asia and depopulated Europe. <a href="#note-2011" name="noteref-2011"><small>2011</small></a>

[ The manner in which the war was conducted surely has
little relation to the abstract question of the justice or injustice of
the war. The most just and necessary war may be conducted with the
most prodigal waste of human life, and the wildest fanaticism; the
most unjust with the coolest moderation and consummate generalship. The
question is, whether the liberties and religion of Europe were in danger
from the aggressions of Mahometanism? If so, it is difficult to
limit the right, though it may be proper to question the wisdom, of
overwhelming the enemy with the armed population of a whole continent,
and repelling, if possible, the invading conqueror into his native
deserts. The crusades are monuments of human folly! but to which of
the more regular wars civilized. Europe, waged for personal ambition or
national jealousy, will our calmer reason appeal as monuments either of
human justice or human wisdom?&mdash;M.]

<p>
II. Palestine could add nothing to the strength or safety of the Latins;
and fanaticism alone could pretend to justify the conquest of that
distant and narrow province. The Christians affirmed that their
inalienable title to the promised land had been sealed by the blood
of their divine Savior; it was their right and duty to rescue their
inheritance from the unjust possessors, who profaned his sepulchre, and
oppressed the pilgrimage of his disciples. Vainly would it be alleged
that the preeminence of Jerusalem, and the sanctity of Palestine, have
been abolished with the Mosaic law; that the God of the Christians is
not a local deity, and that the recovery of Bethlem or Calvary, his
cradle or his tomb, will not atone for the violation of the moral
precepts of the gospel. Such arguments glance aside from the leaden
shield of superstition; and the religious mind will not easily
relinquish its hold on the sacred ground of mystery and miracle.

III. But the holy wars which have been waged in every climate of the
globe, from Egypt to Livonia, and from Peru to Hindostan, require the
support of some more general and flexible tenet. It has been often
supposed, and sometimes affirmed, that a difference of religion is a
worthy cause of hostility; that obstinate unbelievers may be slain
or subdued by the champions of the cross; and that grace is the sole
fountain of dominion as well as of mercy. <a href="#note-2012" name="noteref-2012"><small>2012</small></a> Above four hundred
years before the first crusade, the eastern and western provinces of
the Roman empire had been acquired about the same time, and in the same
manner, by the Barbarians of Germany and Arabia. Time and treaties had
legitimated the conquest of the Christian Franks; but in the eyes of
their subjects and neighbors, the Mahometan princes were still tyrants
and usurpers, who, by the arms of war or rebellion, might be lawfully
driven from their unlawful possession. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a>

[ The vith Discourse of Fleury on Ecclesiastical History
(p. 223-261) contains an accurate and rational view of the causes and
effects of the crusades.]
</p>
<p>
As the manners of the Christians were relaxed, their discipline of
penance <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> was enforced; and with the multiplication of sins, the
remedies were multiplied. In the primitive church, a voluntary and
open confession prepared the work of atonement. In the middle ages, the
bishops and priests interrogated the criminal; compelled him to account
for his thoughts, words, and actions; and prescribed the terms of
his reconciliation with God. But as this discretionary power might
alternately be abused by indulgence and tyranny, a rule of discipline
was framed, to inform and regulate the spiritual judges. This mode of
legislation was invented by the Greeks; their penitentials <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> were
translated, or imitated, in the Latin church; and, in the time of
Charlemagne, the clergy of every diocese were provided with a code,
which they prudently concealed from the knowledge of the vulgar. In this
dangerous estimate of crimes and punishments, each case was supposed,
each difference was remarked, by the experience or penetration of
the monks; some sins are enumerated which innocence could not have
suspected, and others which reason cannot believe; and the more ordinary
offences of fornication and adultery, of perjury and sacrilege, of
rapine and murder, were expiated by a penance, which, according to the
various circumstances, was prolonged from forty days to seven years.
During this term of mortification, the patient was healed, the criminal
was absolved, by a salutary regimen of fasts and prayers: the disorder
of his dress was expressive of grief and remorse; and he humbly
abstained from all the business and pleasure of social life. But the
rigid execution of these laws would have depopulated the palace, the
camp, and the city; the Barbarians of the West believed and trembled;
but nature often rebelled against principle; and the magistrate labored
without effect to enforce the jurisdiction of the priest. A literal
accomplishment of penance was indeed impracticable: the guilt of
adultery was multiplied by daily repetition; that of homicide might
involve the massacre of a whole people; each act was separately
numbered; and, in those times of anarchy and vice, a modest sinner might
easily incur a debt of three hundred years. His insolvency was relieved
by a commutation, or indulgence: a year of penance was appreciated at
twenty-six solidi <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> of silver, about four pounds sterling, for the
rich; at three solidi, or nine shillings, for the indigent: and these
alms were soon appropriated to the use of the church, which derived,
from the redemption of sins, an inexhaustible source of opulence and
dominion. A debt of three hundred years, or twelve hundred pounds,
was enough to impoverish a plentiful fortune; the scarcity of gold
and silver was supplied by the alienation of land; and the princely
donations of Pepin and Charlemagne are expressly given for the remedy
of their soul. It is a maxim of the civil law, that whosoever cannot pay
with his purse, must pay with his body; and the practice of flagellation
was adopted by the monks, a cheap, though painful equivalent. By a
fantastic arithmetic, a year of penance was taxed at three thousand
lashes; <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> and such was the skill and patience of a famous hermit, St.
Dominic of the iron Cuirass, <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> that in six days he could discharge
an entire century, by a whipping of three hundred thousand stripes.
His example was followed by many penitents of both sexes; and, as a
vicarious sacrifice was accepted, a sturdy disciplinarian might expiate
on his own back the sins of his benefactors. <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> These compensations
of the purse and the person introduced, in the eleventh century, a more
honorable mode of satisfaction. The merit of military service against
the Saracens of Africa and Spain had been allowed by the predecessors
of Urban the Second. In the council of Clermont, that pope proclaimed
a plenary indulgence to those who should enlist under the banner of the
cross; the absolution of all their sins, and a full receipt for all that
might be due of canonical penance. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> The cold philosophy of modern
times is incapable of feeling the impression that was made on a sinful
and fanatic world. At the voice of their pastor, the robber, the
incendiary, the homicide, arose by thousands to redeem their souls,
by repeating on the infidels the same deeds which they had exercised
against their Christian brethren; and the terms of atonement were
eagerly embraced by offenders of every rank and denomination. None were
pure; none were exempt from the guilt and penalty of sin; and those who
were the least amenable to the justice of God and the church were the
best entitled to the temporal and eternal recompense of their pious
courage. If they fell, the spirit of the Latin clergy did not hesitate
to adorn their tomb with the crown of martyrdom; <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> and should they
survive, they could expect without impatience the delay and increase of
their heavenly reward. They offered their blood to the Son of God, who
had laid down his life for their salvation: they took up the cross, and
entered with confidence into the way of the Lord. His providence would
watch over their safety; perhaps his visible and miraculous power would
smooth the difficulties of their holy enterprise. The cloud and pillar
of Jehovah had marched before the Israelites into the promised land.
Might not the Christians more reasonably hope that the rivers would open
for their passage; that the walls of their strongest cities would fall
at the sound of their trumpets; and that the sun would be arrested in
his mid career, to allow them time for the destruction of the infidels?

<h2>
    Chapter LVIII: The First Crusade.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
Of the chiefs and soldiers who marched to the holy sepulchre, I will
dare to affirm, that all were prompted by the spirit of enthusiasm; the
belief of merit, the hope of reward, and the assurance of divine aid.
But I am equally persuaded, that in many it was not the sole, that in
some it was not the leading, principle of action. The use and abuse of
religion are feeble to stem, they are strong and irresistible to
impel, the stream of national manners. Against the private wars of the
Barbarians, their bloody tournaments, licentious love, and judicial
duels, the popes and synods might ineffectually thunder. It is a more
easy task to provoke the metaphysical disputes of the Greeks, to drive
into the cloister the victims of anarchy or despotism, to sanctify the
patience of slaves and cowards, or to assume the merit of the humanity
and benevolence of modern Christians. War and exercise were the reigning
passions of the Franks or Latins; they were enjoined, as a penance, to
gratify those passions, to visit distant lands, and to draw their swords
against the nation of the East. Their victory, or even their attempt,
would immortalize the names of the intrepid heroes of the cross; and the
purest piety could not be insensible to the most splendid prospect of
military glory. In the petty quarrels of Europe, they shed the blood of
their friends and countrymen, for the acquisition perhaps of a castle
or a village. They could march with alacrity against the distant and
hostile nations who were devoted to their arms; their fancy already
grasped the golden sceptres of Asia; and the conquest of Apulia and
Sicily by the Normans might exalt to royalty the hopes of the most
private adventurer. Christendom, in her rudest state, must have yielded
to the climate and cultivation of the Mahometan countries; and their
natural and artificial wealth had been magnified by the tales of
pilgrims, and the gifts of an imperfect commerce. The vulgar, both the
great and small, were taught to believe every wonder, of lands flowing
with milk and honey, of mines and treasures, of gold and diamonds, of
palaces of marble and jasper, and of odoriferous groves of cinnamon and
frankincense. In this earthly paradise, each warrior depended on
his sword to carve a plenteous and honorable establishment, which
he measured only by the extent of his wishes. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> Their vassals and
soldiers trusted their fortunes to God and their master: the spoils of
a Turkish emir might enrich the meanest follower of the camp; and
the flavor of the wines, the beauty of the Grecian women, <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> were
temptations more adapted to the nature, than to the profession, of the
champions of the cross. The love of freedom was a powerful incitement to
the multitudes who were oppressed by feudal or ecclesiastical tyranny.
Under this holy sign, the peasants and burghers, who were attached
to the servitude of the glebe, might escape from a haughty lord, and
transplant themselves and their families to a land of liberty. The monk
might release himself from the discipline of his convent: the debtor
might suspend the accumulation of usury, and the pursuit of his
creditors; and outlaws and malefactors of every cast might continue to
brave the laws and elude the punishment of their crimes. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a>

<p>
These motives were potent and numerous: when we have singly computed
their weight on the mind of each individual, we must add the infinite
series, the multiplying powers, of example and fashion. The first
proselytes became the warmest and most effectual missionaries of the
cross: among their friends and countrymen they preached the duty, the
merit, and the recompense, of their holy vow; and the most reluctant
hearers were insensibly drawn within the whirlpool of persuasion and
authority. The martial youths were fired by the reproach or suspicion
of cowardice; the opportunity of visiting with an army the sepulchre of
Christ was embraced by the old and infirm, by women and children, who
consulted rather their zeal than their strength; and those who in the
evening had derided the folly of their companions, were the most eager,
the ensuing day, to tread in their footsteps. The ignorance, which
magnified the hopes, diminished the perils, of the enterprise. Since the
Turkish conquest, the paths of pilgrimage were obliterated; the chiefs
themselves had an imperfect notion of the length of the way and the
state of their enemies; and such was the stupidity of the people, that,
at the sight of the first city or castle beyond the limits of their
knowledge, they were ready to ask whether that was not the Jerusalem,
the term and object of their labors. Yet the more prudent of the
crusaders, who were not sure that they should be fed from heaven with
a shower of quails or manna, provided themselves with those precious
metals, which, in every country, are the representatives of every
commodity. To defray, according to their rank, the expenses of the
road, princes alienated their provinces, nobles their lands and castles,
peasants their cattle and the instruments of husbandry. The value of
property was depreciated by the eager competition of multitudes; while
the price of arms and horses was raised to an exorbitant height by the
wants and impatience of the buyers. <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> Those who remained at home,
with sense and money, were enriched by the epidemical disease: the
sovereigns acquired at a cheap rate the domains of their vassals; and
the ecclesiastical purchasers completed the payment by the assurance of
their prayers. The cross, which was commonly sewed on the garment, in
cloth or silk, was inscribed by some zealots on their skin: a hot iron,
or indelible liquor, was applied to perpetuate the mark; and a crafty
monk, who showed the miraculous impression on his breast was repaid with
the popular veneration and the richest benefices of Palestine. <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a>

The fifteenth of August had been fixed in the council of Clermont
for the departure of the pilgrims; but the day was anticipated by the
thoughtless and needy crowd of plebeians, and I shall briefly despatch
the calamities which they inflicted and suffered, before I enter on
the more serious and successful enterprise of the chiefs. Early in the
spring, from the confines of France and Lorraine, above sixty thousand
of the populace of both sexes flocked round the first missionary of the
crusade, and pressed him with clamorous importunity to lead them to the
holy sepulchre. The hermit, assuming the character, without the talents
or authority, of a general, impelled or obeyed the forward impulse of
his votaries along the banks of the Rhine and Danube. Their wants and
numbers soon compelled them to separate, and his lieutenant, Walter
the Penniless, a valiant though needy soldier, conducted a van guard of
pilgrims, whose condition may be determined from the proportion of eight
horsemen to fifteen thousand foot. The example and footsteps of Peter
were closely pursued by another fanatic, the monk Godescal, whose
sermons had swept away fifteen or twenty thousand peasants from the
villages of Germany. Their rear was again pressed by a herd of two
hundred thousand, the most stupid and savage refuse of the people, who
mingled with their devotion a brutal license of rapine, prostitution,
and drunkenness. Some counts and gentlemen, at the head of three
thousand horse, attended the motions of the multitude to partake in
the spoil; but their genuine leaders (may we credit such folly?) were
a goose and a goat, who were carried in the front, and to whom these
worthy Christians ascribed an infusion of the divine spirit. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a>
Of these, and of other bands of enthusiasts, the first and most easy
warfare was against the Jews, the murderers of the Son of God. In
the trading cities of the Moselle and the Rhine, their colonies were
numerous and rich; and they enjoyed, under the protection of the emperor
and the bishops, the free exercise of their religion. <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> At Verdun,
Treves, Mentz, Spires, Worms, many thousands of that unhappy people
were pillaged and massacred: <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> nor had they felt a more bloody stroke
since the persecution of Hadrian. A remnant was saved by the firmness of
their bishops, who accepted a feigned and transient conversion; but the
more obstinate Jews opposed their fanaticism to the fanaticism of the
Christians, barricadoed their houses, and precipitating themselves,
their families, and their wealth, into the rivers or the flames,
disappointed the malice, or at least the avarice, of their implacable
foes.

invaders. Can any one doubt that a large portion of this host must have

Between the frontiers of Austria and the seat of the Byzan tine
monarchy, the crusaders were compelled to traverse as interval of six
hundred miles; the wild and desolate countries of Hungary <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> and
Bulgaria. The soil is fruitful, and intersected with rivers; but it
was then covered with morasses and forests, which spread to a boundless
extent, whenever man has ceased to exercise his dominion over the earth.
Both nations had imbibed the rudiments of Christianity; the Hungarians
were ruled by their native princes; the Bulgarians by a lieutenant of
the Greek emperor; but, on the slightest provocation, their ferocious
nature was rekindled, and ample provocation was afforded by the
disorders of the first pilgrims Agriculture must have been unskilful
and languid among a people, whose cities were built of reeds and timber,
which were deserted in the summer season for the tents of hunters and
shepherds. A scanty supply of provisions was rudely demanded, forcibly
seized, and greedily consumed; and on the first quarrel, the crusaders
gave a loose to indignation and revenge. But their ignorance of the
country, of war, and of discipline, exposed them to every snare. The
Greek praefect of Bulgaria commanded a regular force; <a href="#note-381" name="noteref-381"><small>381</small></a> at the
trumpet of the Hungarian king, the eighth or the tenth of his martial
subjects bent their bows and mounted on horseback; their policy was
insidious, and their retaliation on these pious robbers was unrelenting
and bloody. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> About a third of the naked fugitives (and the hermit
Peter was of the number) escaped to the Thracian mountains; and
the emperor, who respected the pilgrimage and succor of the Latins,
conducted them by secure and easy journeys to Constantinople, and
advised them to await the arrival of their brethren. For a while they
remembered their faults and losses; but no sooner were they revived by
the hospitable entertainment, than their venom was again inflamed; they
stung their benefactor, and neither gardens, nor palaces, nor churches,
were safe from their depredations. For his own safety, Alexius allured
them to pass over to the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus; but their blind
impetuosity soon urged them to desert the station which he had assigned,
and to rush headlong against the Turks, who occupied the road to
Jerusalem. The hermit, conscious of his shame, had withdrawn from the
camp to Constantinople; and his lieutenant, Walter the Penniless, who
was worthy of a better command, attempted without success to introduce
some order and prudence among the herd of savages. They separated in
quest of prey, and themselves fell an easy prey to the arts of the
sultan. By a rumor that their foremost companions were rioting in the
spoils of his capital, Soliman <a href="#note-391" name="noteref-391"><small>391</small></a> tempted the main body to descend
into the plain of Nice: they were overwhelmed by the Turkish arrows; and
a pyramid of bones <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> informed their companions of the place of their
defeat. Of the first crusaders, three hundred thousand had already
perished, before a single city was rescued from the infidels, before
their graver and more noble brethren had completed the preparations of
their enterprise. <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a>

    [See Table 1.: Events Of The First Crusade]
</pre>
<p>
None of the great sovereigns of Europe embarked their persons in the
first crusade. The emperor Henry the Fourth was not disposed to obey
the summons of the pope: Philip the First of France was occupied by his
pleasures; William Rufus of England by a recent conquest; the kin`gs of
Spain were engaged in a domestic war against the Moors; and the northern
monarchs of Scotland, Denmark, <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> Sweden, and Poland, were yet
strangers to the passions and interests of the South. The religious
ardor was more strongly felt by the princes of the second order, who
held an important place in the feudal system. Their situation will
naturally cast under four distinct heads the review of their names and
characters; but I may escape some needless repetition, by observing at
once, that courage and the exercise of arms are the common attribute of
these Christian adventurers. I. The first rank both in war and council
is justly due to Godfrey of Bouillon; and happy would it have been for
the crusaders, if they had trusted themselves to the sole conduct of
that accomplished hero, a worthy representative of Charlemagne, from
whom he was descended in the female line. His father was of the noble
race of the counts of Boulogne: Brabant, the lower province of Lorraine,
<a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> was the inheritance of his mother; and by the emperor's bounty he
was himself invested with that ducal title, which has been improperly
transferred to his lordship of Bouillon in the Ardennes. <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> In the
service of Henry the Fourth, he bore the great standard of the empire,
and pierced with his lance the breast of Rodolph, the rebel king:
Godfrey was the first who ascended the walls of Rome; and his sickness,
his vow, perhaps his remorse for bearing arms against the pope,
confirmed an early resolution of visiting the holy sepulchre, not as
a pilgrim, but a deliverer. His valor was matured by prudence and
moderation; his piety, though blind, was sincere; and, in the tumult
of a camp, he practised the real and fictitious virtues of a convent.
Superior to the private factions of the chiefs, he reserved his enmity
for the enemies of Christ; and though he gained a kingdom by the
attempt, his pure and disinterested zeal was acknowledged by his rivals.
Godfrey of Bouillon <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> was accompanied by his two brothers, by Eustace
the elder, who had succeeded to the county of Boulogne, and by the
younger, Baldwin, a character of more ambiguous virtue. The duke of
Lorraine, was alike celebrated on either side of the Rhine: from his
birth and education, he was equally conversant with the French and
Teutonic languages: the barons of France, Germany, and Lorraine,
assembled their vassals; and the confederate force that marched under
his banner was composed of fourscore thousand foot and about ten
thousand horse. II. In the parliament that was held at Paris, in the
king's presence, about two months after the council of Clermont, Hugh,
count of Vermandois, was the most conspicuous of the princes who assumed
the cross. But the appellation of the Great was applied, not so much to
his merit or possessions, (though neither were contemptible,) as to the
royal birth of the brother of the king of France. <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> Robert, duke
of Normandy, was the eldest son of William the Conqueror; but on his
father's death he was deprived of the kingdom of England, by his own
indolence and the activity of his brother Rufus. The worth of Robert was
degraded by an excessive levity and easiness of temper: his cheerfulness
seduced him to the indulgence of pleasure; his profuse liberality
impoverished the prince and people; his indiscriminate clemency
multiplied the number of offenders; and the amiable qualities of
a private man became the essential defects of a sovereign. For the
trifling sum of ten thousand marks, he mortgaged Normandy during his
absence to the English usurper; <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> but his engagement and behavior in
the holy war announced in Robert a reformation of manners, and restored
him in some degree to the public esteem. Another Robert was count of
Flanders, a royal province, which, in this century, gave three queens to
the thrones of France, England, and Denmark: he was surnamed the
Sword and Lance of the Christians; but in the exploits of a soldier he
sometimes forgot the duties of a general. Stephen, count of Chartres, of
Blois, and of Troyes, was one of the richest princes of the age; and
the number of his castles has been compared to the three hundred and
sixty-five days of the year. His mind was improved by literature; and,
in the council of the chiefs, the eloquent Stephen <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> was chosen to
discharge the office of their president. These four were the principal
leaders of the French, the Normans, and the pilgrims of the British
isles: but the list of the barons who were possessed of three or four
towns would exceed, says a contemporary, the catalogue of the Trojan
war. <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> III. In the south of France, the command was assumed by
Adhemar bishop of Puy, the pope egate, and by Raymond count of St.
Giles and Thoulouse who added the prouder titles of duke of Narbonne
and marquis of Provence. The former was a respectable prelate, alike
qualified for this world and the next. The latter was a veteran warrior,
who had fought against the Saracens of Spain, and who consecrated
his declining age, not only to the deliverance, but to the perpetual
service, of the holy sepulchre. His experience and riches gave him a
strong ascendant in the Christian camp, whose distress he was often
able, and sometimes willing, to relieve. But it was easier for him to
extort the praise of the Infidels, than to preserve the love of his
subjects and associates. His eminent qualities were clouded by a temper
haughty, envious, and obstinate; and, though he resigned an ample
patrimony for the cause of God, his piety, in the public opinion, was
not exempt from avarice and ambition. <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> A mercantile, rather than
a martial, spirit prevailed among his provincials, <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> a common name,
which included the natives of Auvergne and Languedoc, <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> the vassals
of the kingdom of Burgundy or Arles. From the adjacent frontier of Spain
he drew a band of hardy adventurers; as he marched through Lombardy,
a crowd of Italians flocked to his standard, and his united force
consisted of one hundred thousand horse and foot. If Raymond was the
first to enlist and the last to depart, the delay may be excused by the
greatness of his preparation and the promise of an everlasting farewell.
IV. The name of Bohemond, the son of Robert Guiscard, was already famous
by his double victory over the Greek emperor; but his father's will had
reduced him to the principality of Tarentum, and the remembrance of his
Eastern trophies, till he was awakened by the rumor and passage of the
French pilgrims. It is in the person of this Norman chief that we
may seek for the coolest policy and ambition, with a small allay of
religious fanaticism. His conduct may justify a belief that he had
secretly directed the design of the pope, which he affected to second
with astonishment and zeal: at the siege of Amalphi, his example and
discourse inflamed the passions of a confederate army; he instantly tore
his garment to supply crosses for the numerous candidates, and prepared
to visit Constantinople and Asia at the head of ten thousand horse and
twenty thousand foot. Several princes of the Norman race accompanied
this veteran general; and his cousin Tancred <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> was the partner,
rather than the servant, of the war.
</p>
<p>
In the accomplished character of Tancred we discover all the virtues of
a perfect knight, <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> the true spirit of chivalry, which inspired the
generous sentiments and social offices of man far better than the base
philosophy, or the baser religion, of the times.

<h2>
    Chapter LVIII: The First Crusade.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
Between the age of Charlemagne and that of the crusades, a revolution
had taken place among the Spaniards, the Normans, and the French,
which was gradually extended to the rest of Europe. The service of the
infantry was degraded to the plebeians; the cavalry formed the strength
of the armies, and the honorable name of miles, or soldier, was confined
to the gentlemen <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> who served on horseback, and were invested with
the character of knighthood. The dukes and counts, who had usurped
the rights of sovereignty, divided the provinces among their faithful
barons: the barons distributed among their vassals the fiefs or
benefices of their jurisdiction; and these military tenants, the peers
of each other and of their lord, composed the noble or equestrian
order, which disdained to conceive the peasant or burgher as of the same
species with themselves. The dignity of their birth was preserved by
pure and equal alliances; their sons alone, who could produce four
quarters or lines of ancestry without spot or reproach, might legally
pretend to the honor of knighthood; but a valiant plebeian was sometimes
enriched and ennobled by the sword, and became the father of a new race.
A single knight could impart, according to his judgment, the character
which he received; and the warlike sovereigns of Europe derived more
glory from this personal distinction than from the lustre of their
diadem. This ceremony, of which some traces may be found in Tacitus and
the woods of Germany, <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> was in its origin simple and profane; the
candidate, after some previous trial, was invested with the sword and
spurs; and his cheek or shoulder was touched with a slight blow, as an
emblem of the last affront which it was lawful for him to endure. But
superstition mingled in every public and private action of life: in
the holy wars, it sanctified the profession of arms; and the order of
chivalry was assimilated in its rights and privileges to the sacred
orders of priesthood. The bath and white garment of the novice were
an indecent copy of the regeneration of baptism: his sword, which he
offered on the altar, was blessed by the ministers of religion: his
solemn reception was preceded by fasts and vigils; and he was created
a knight in the name of God, of St. George, and of St. Michael the
archangel. He swore to accomplish the duties of his profession;
and education, example, and the public opinion, were the inviolable
guardians of his oath. As the champion of God and the ladies, (I blush
to unite such discordant names,) he devoted himself to speak the truth;
to maintain the right; to protect the distressed; to practise courtesy,
a virtue less familiar to the ancients; to pursue the infidels; to
despise the allurements of ease and safety; and to vindicate in every
perilous adventure the honor of his character. The abuse of the same
spirit provoked the illiterate knight to disdain the arts of industry
and peace; to esteem himself the sole judge and avenger of his own
injuries; and proudly to neglect the laws of civil society and military
discipline. Yet the benefits of this institution, to refine the temper
of Barbarians, and to infuse some principles of faith, justice, and
humanity, were strongly felt, and have been often observed. The asperity
of national prejudice was softened; and the community of religion and
arms spread a similar color and generous emulation over the face of
Christendom. Abroad in enterprise and pilgrimage, at home in martial
exercise, the warriors of every country were perpetually associated; and
impartial taste must prefer a Gothic tournament to the Olympic games of
classic antiquity. <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> Instead of the naked spectacles which corrupted
the manners of the Greeks, and banished from the stadium the virgins
and matrons, the pompous decoration of the lists was crowned with the
presence of chaste and high-born beauty, from whose hands the conqueror
received the prize of his dexterity and courage. The skill and strength
that were exerted in wrestling and boxing bear a distant and doubtful
relation to the merit of a soldier; but the tournaments, as they were
invented in France, and eagerly adopted both in the East and West,
presented a lively image of the business of the field. The single
combats, the general skirmish, the defence of a pass, or castle, were
rehearsed as in actual service; and the contest, both in real and mimic
war, was decided by the superior management of the horse and lance. The
lance was the proper and peculiar weapon of the knight: his horse was
of a large and heavy breed; but this charger, till he was roused by the
approaching danger, was usually led by an attendant, and he quietly rode
a pad or palfrey of a more easy pace. His helmet and sword, his greaves
and buckler, it would be superfluous to describe; but I may remark,
that, at the period of the crusades, the armor was less ponderous than
in later times; and that, instead of a massy cuirass, his breast was
defended by a hauberk or coat of mail. When their long lances were fixed
in the rest, the warriors furiously spurred their horses against the
foe; and the light cavalry of the Turks and Arabs could seldom stand
against the direct and impetuous weight of their charge. Each knight was
attended to the field by his faithful squire, a youth of equal birth and
similar hopes; he was followed by his archers and men at arms, and four,
or five, or six soldiers were computed as the furniture of a complete
lance. In the expeditions to the neighboring kingdoms or the Holy Land,
the duties of the feudal tenure no longer subsisted; the voluntary
service of the knights and their followers were either prompted by zeal
or attachment, or purchased with rewards and promises; and the numbers
of each squadron were measured by the power, the wealth, and the fame,
of each independent chieftain. They were distinguished by his banner,
his armorial coat, and his cry of war; and the most ancient families
of Europe must seek in these achievements the origin and proof of
their nobility. In this rapid portrait of chivalry I have been urged to
anticipate on the story of the crusades, at once an effect and a cause,
of this memorable institution. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a>

Such were the troops, and such the leaders, who assumed the cross for
the deliverance of the holy sepulchre. As soon as they were relieved by
the absence of the plebeian multitude, they encouraged each other,
by interviews and messages, to accomplish their vow, and hasten their
departure. Their wives and sisters were desirous of partaking the danger
and merit of the pilgrimage: their portable treasures were conveyed in
bars of silver and gold; and the princes and barons were attended by
their equipage of hounds and hawks to amuse their leisure and to supply
their table. The difficulty of procuring subsistence for so many myriads
of men and horses engaged them to separate their forces: their choice
or situation determined the road; and it was agreed to meet in
the neighborhood of Constantinople, and from thence to begin their
operations against the Turks. From the banks of the Meuse and the
Moselle, Godfrey of Bouillon followed the direct way of Germany,
Hungary, and Bulgaria; and, as long as he exercised the sole command
every step afforded some proof of his prudence and virtue. On the
confines of Hungary he was stopped three weeks by a Christian people,
to whom the name, or at least the abuse, of the cross was justly odious.
The Hungarians still smarted with the wounds which they had received
from the first pilgrims: in their turn they had abused the right of
defence and retaliation; and they had reason to apprehend a severe
revenge from a hero of the same nation, and who was engaged in the same
cause. But, after weighing the motives and the events, the virtuous
duke was content to pity the crimes and misfortunes of his worthless
brethren; and his twelve deputies, the messengers of peace, requested in
his name a free passage and an equal market. To remove their suspicions,
Godfrey trusted himself, and afterwards his brother, to the faith of
Carloman, <a href="#note-581" name="noteref-581"><small>581</small></a> king of Hungary, who treated them with a simple but
hospitable entertainment: the treaty was sanctified by their common
gospel; and a proclamation, under pain of death, restrained the
animosity and license of the Latin soldiers. From Austria to Belgrade,
they traversed the plains of Hungary, without enduring or offering an
injury; and the proximity of Carloman, who hovered on their flanks with
his numerous cavalry, was a precaution not less useful for their safety
than for his own. They reached the banks of the Save; and no sooner had
they passed the river, than the king of Hungary restored the hostages,
and saluted their departure with the fairest wishes for the success of
their enterprise. With the same conduct and discipline, Godfrey
pervaded the woods of Bulgaria and the frontiers of Thrace; and might
congratulate himself that he had almost reached the first term of his
pilgrimage, without drawing his sword against a Christian adversary.
After an easy and pleasant journey through Lombardy, from Turin to
Aquileia, Raymond and his provincials marched forty days through
the savage country of Dalmatia <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> and Sclavonia. The weather was a
perpetual fog; the land was mountainous and desolate; the natives were
either fugitive or hostile: loose in their religion and government, they
refused to furnish provisions or guides; murdered the stragglers; and
exercised by night and day the vigilance of the count, who derived
more security from the punishment of some captive robbers than from his
interview and treaty with the prince of Scodra. <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> His march between
Durazzo and Constantinople was harassed, without being stopped, by
the peasants and soldiers of the Greek emperor; and the same faint and
ambiguous hostility was prepared for the remaining chiefs, who passed
the Adriatic from the coast of Italy. Bohemond had arms and vessels,
and foresight and discipline; and his name was not forgotten in the
provinces of Epirus and Thessaly. Whatever obstacles he encountered were
surmounted by his military conduct and the valor of Tancred; and if the
Norman prince affected to spare the Greeks, he gorged his soldiers
with the full plunder of an heretical castle. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> The nobles of France
pressed forwards with the vain and thoughtless ardor of which their
nation has been sometimes accused. From the Alps to Apulia the march of
Hugh the Great, of the two Roberts, and of Stephen of Chartres, through
a wealthy country, and amidst the applauding Catholics, was a devout or
triumphant progress: they kissed the feet of the Roman pontiff; and the
golden standard of St. Peter was delivered to the brother of the French
monarch. <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> But in this visit of piety and pleasure, they neglected
to secure the season, and the means of their embarkation: the winter was
insensibly lost: their troops were scattered and corrupted in the towns
of Italy. They separately accomplished their passage, regardless
of safety or dignity; and within nine months from the feast of the
Assumption, the day appointed by Urban, all the Latin princes had
reached Constantinople. But the count of Vermandois was produced as
a captive; his foremost vessels were scattered by a tempest; and his
person, against the law of nations, was detained by the lieutenants of
Alexius. Yet the arrival of Hugh had been announced by four-and-twenty
knights in golden armor, who commanded the emperor to revere the general
of the Latin Christians, the brother of the king of kings. <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> <a href="#note-631" name="noteref-631"><small>631</small></a>

<p>
In some oriental tale I have read the fable of a shepherd, who was
ruined by the accomplishment of his own wishes: he had prayed for water;
the Ganges was turned into his grounds, and his flock and cottage were
swept away by the inundation. Such was the fortune, or at least the
apprehension of the Greek emperor Alexius Comnenus, whose name has
already appeared in this history, and whose conduct is so differently
represented by his daughter Anne, <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> and by the Latin writers. <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a>
In the council of Placentia, his ambassadors had solicited a moderate
succor, perhaps of ten thousand soldiers, but he was astonished by
the approach of so many potent chiefs and fanatic nations. The emperor
fluctuated between hope and fear, between timidity and courage; but
in the crooked policy which he mistook for wisdom, I cannot believe, I
cannot discern, that he maliciously conspired against the life or honor
of the French heroes. The promiscuous multitudes of Peter the Hermit
were savage beasts, alike destitute of humanity and reason: nor was it
possible for Alexius to prevent or deplore their destruction. The
troops of Godfrey and his peers were less contemptible, but not less
suspicious, to the Greek emperor. Their motives might be pure and pious:
but he was equally alarmed by his knowledge of the ambitious Bohemond,
<a href="#note-651" name="noteref-651"><small>651</small></a> and his ignorance of the Transalpine chiefs: the courage of the
French was blind and headstrong; they might be tempted by the luxury and
wealth of Greece, and elated by the view and opinion of their
invincible strength: and Jerusalem might be forgotten in the prospect of
Constantinople. After a long march and painful abstinence, the troops of
Godfrey encamped in the plains of Thrace; they heard with indignation,
that their brother, the count of Vermandois, was imprisoned by the
Greeks; and their reluctant duke was compelled to indulge them in some
freedom of retaliation and rapine. They were appeased by the submission
of Alexius: he promised to supply their camp; and as they refused, in
the midst of winter, to pass the Bosphorus, their quarters were assigned
among the gardens and palaces on the shores of that narrow sea. But an
incurable jealousy still rankled in the minds of the two nations, who
despised each other as slaves and Barbarians. Ignorance is the ground of
suspicion, and suspicion was inflamed into daily provocations: prejudice
is blind, hunger is deaf; and Alexius is accused of a design to starve
or assault the Latins in a dangerous post, on all sides encompassed with
the waters. <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> Godfrey sounded his trumpets, burst the net, overspread
the plain, and insulted the suburbs; but the gates of Constantinople
were strongly fortified; the ramparts were lined with archers; and,
after a doubtful conflict, both parties listened to the voice of peace
and religion. The gifts and promises of the emperor insensibly soothed
the fierce spirit of the western strangers; as a Christian warrior, he
rekindled their zeal for the prosecution of their holy enterprise, which
he engaged to second with his troops and treasures. On the return of
spring, Godfrey was persuaded to occupy a pleasant and plentiful camp in
Asia; and no sooner had he passed the Bosphorus, than the Greek vessels
were suddenly recalled to the opposite shore. The same policy was
repeated with the succeeding chiefs, who were swayed by the example, and
weakened by the departure, of their foremost companions. By his skill
and diligence, Alexius prevented the union of any two of the confederate
armies at the same moment under the walls of Constantinople; and before
the feast of the Pentecost not a Latin pilgrim was left on the coast of
Europe.

The same arms which threatened Europe might deliver Asia, and repel the
Turks from the neighboring shores of the Bosphorus and Hellespont. The
fair provinces from Nice to Antioch were the recent patrimony of the
Roman emperor; and his ancient and perpetual claim still embraced the
kingdoms of Syria and Egypt. In his enthusiasm, Alexius indulged, or
affected, the ambitious hope of leading his new allies to subvert
the thrones of the East; but the calmer dictates of reason and temper
dissuaded him from exposing his royal person to the faith of unknown
and lawless Barbarians. His prudence, or his pride, was content with
extorting from the French princes an oath of homage and fidelity, and a
solemn promise, that they
</p>
<p>
would either restore, or hold, their Asiatic conquests as the humble and
loyal vassals of the Roman empire. Their independent spirit was fired at
the mention of this foreign and voluntary servitude: they successively
yielded to the dexterous application of gifts and flattery; and the
first proselytes became the most eloquent and effectual missionaries to
multiply the companions of their shame. The pride of Hugh of Vermandois
was soothed by the honors of his captivity; and in the brother of the
French king, the example of submission was prevalent and weighty. In the
mind of Godfrey of Bouillon every human consideration was subordinate to
the glory of God and the success of the crusade. He had firmly resisted
the temptations of Bohemond and Raymond, who urged the attack and
conquest of Constantinople. Alexius esteemed his virtues, deservedly
named him the champion of the empire, and dignified his homage with the
filial name and the rights of adoption. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> The hateful Bohemond was
received as a true and ancient ally; and if the emperor reminded him
of former hostilities, it was only to praise the valor that he had
displayed, and the glory that he had acquired, in the fields of Durazzo
and Larissa. The son of Guiscard was lodged and entertained, and served
with Imperial pomp: one day, as he passed through the gallery of the
palace, a door was carelessly left open to expose a pile of gold and
silver, of silk and gems, of curious and costly furniture, that was
heaped, in seeming disorder, from the floor to the roof of the chamber.
"What conquests," exclaimed the ambitious miser, "might not be achieved
by the possession of such a treasure!"&mdash;"It is your own," replied a
Greek attendant, who watched the motions of his soul; and Bohemond,
after some hesitation, condescended to accept this magnificent
present. The Norman was flattered by the assurance of an independent
principality; and Alexius eluded, rather than denied, his daring
demand of the office of great domestic, or general of the East. The two
Roberts, the son of the conqueror of England, and the kinsmen of three
queens, <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> bowed in their turn before the Byzantine throne. A private
letter of Stephen of Chartres attests his admiration of the emperor, the
most excellent and liberal of men, who taught him to believe that he was
a favorite, and promised to educate and establish his youngest son.
In his southern province, the count of St. Giles and Thoulouse faintly
recognized the supremacy of the king of France, a prince of a foreign
nation and language. At the head of a hundred thousand men, he declared
that he was the soldier and servant of Christ alone, and that the Greek
might be satisfied with an equal treaty of alliance and friendship. His
obstinate resistance enhanced the value and the price of his submission;
and he shone, says the princess Anne, among the Barbarians, as the sun
amidst the stars of heaven. His disgust of the noise and insolence
of the French, his suspicions of the designs of Bohemond, the emperor
imparted to his faithful Raymond; and that aged statesman might clearly
discern, that however false in friendship, he was sincere in his enmity.
<a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> The spirit of chivalry was last subdued in the person of Tancred;
and none could deem themselves dishonored by the imitation of that
gallant knight. He disdained the gold and flattery of the Greek monarch;
assaulted in his presence an insolent patrician; escaped to Asia in the
habit of a private soldier; and yielded with a sigh to the authority
of Bohemond, and the interest of the Christian cause. The best and
most ostensible reason was the impossibility of passing the sea and
accomplishing their vow, without the license and the vessels of
Alexius; but they cherished a secret hope, that as soon as they trod
the continent of Asia, their swords would obliterate their shame, and
dissolve the engagement, which on his side might not be very faithfully
performed. The ceremony of their homage was grateful to a people who
had long since considered pride as the substitute of power. High on his
throne, the emperor sat mute and immovable: his majesty was adored by
the Latin princes; and they submitted to kiss either his feet or his
knees, an indignity which their own writers are ashamed to confess and
unable to deny. <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a>

Private or public interest suppressed the murmurs of the dukes and

presumed to ascend the throne, and to place himself by the side of
Alexius. The sage reproof of Baldwin provoked him to exclaim, in his
barbarous idiom, "Who is this rustic, that keeps his seat, while so many
valiant captains are standing round him?" The emperor maintained his
silence, dissembled his indignation, and questioned his interpreter
concerning the meaning of the words, which he partly suspected from the
universal language of gesture and countenance. Before the departure
of the pilgrims, he endeavored to learn the name and condition of the
audacious baron. "I am a Frenchman," replied Robert, "of the purest and
most ancient nobility of my country. All that I know is, that there is a
church in my neighborhood, <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> the resort of those who are desirous
of approving their valor in single combat. Till an enemy appears,
they address their prayers to God and his saints. That church I have
frequently visited. But never have I found an antagonist who dared to
accept my defiance." Alexius dismissed the challenger with some prudent
advice for his conduct in the Turkish warfare; and history repeats with
pleasure this lively example of the manners of his age and country.

The conquest of Asia was undertaken and achieved by Alexander, with
thirty-five thousand Macedonians and Greeks; <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> and his best hope was
in the strength and discipline of his phalanx of infantry. The principal
force of the crusaders consisted in their cavalry; and when that force
was mustered in the plains of Bithynia, the knights and their martial
attendants on horseback amounted to one hundred thousand fighting men,
completely armed with the helmet and coat of mail. The value of these
soldiers deserved a strict and authentic account; and the flower of
European chivalry might furnish, in a first effort, this formidable body
of heavy horse. A part of the infantry might be enrolled for the service
of scouts, pioneers, and archers; but the promiscuous crowd were lost in
their own disorder; and we depend not on the eyes and knowledge, but
on the belief and fancy, of a chaplain of Count Baldwin, <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> in the
estimate of six hundred thousand pilgrims able to bear arms, besides the
priests and monks, the women and children of the Latin camp. The reader
starts; and before he is recovered from his surprise, I shall add, on
the same testimony, that if all who took the cross had accomplished
their vow, above six millions would have migrated from Europe to
Asia. Under this oppression of faith, I derive some relief from a more
sagacious and thinking writer, <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> who, after the same review of the
cavalry, accuses the credulity of the priest of Chartres, and even
doubts whether the Cisalpine regions (in the geography of a Frenchman)
were sufficient to produce and pour forth such incredible multitudes.
The coolest scepticism will remember, that of these religious volunteers
great numbers never beheld Constantinople and Nice. Of enthusiasm the
influence is irregular and transient: many were detained at home by
reason or cowardice, by poverty or weakness; and many were repulsed by
the obstacles of the way, the more insuperable as they were unforeseen,
to these ignorant fanatics. The savage countries of Hungary and Bulgaria
were whitened with their bones: their vanguard was cut in pieces by the
Turkish sultan; and the loss of the first adventure, by the sword, or
climate, or fatigue, has already been stated at three hundred thousand
men. Yet the myriads that survived, that marched, that pressed forwards
on the holy pilgrimage, were a subject of astonishment to themselves
and to the Greeks. The copious energy of her language sinks under the
efforts of the princess Anne: <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a> the images of locusts, of leaves and
flowers, of the sands of the sea, or the stars of heaven, imperfectly
represent what she had seen and heard; and the daughter of Alexius
exclaims, that Europe was loosened from its foundations, and hurled
against Asia. The ancient hosts of Darius and Xerxes labor under the
same doubt of a vague and indefinite magnitude; but I am inclined to
believe, that a larger number has never been contained within the lines
of a single camp, than at the siege of Nice, the first operation of the
Latin princes. Their motives, their characters, and their arms, have
been already displayed. Of their troops the most numerous portion
were natives of France: the Low Countries, the banks of the Rhine, and
Apulia, sent a powerful reenforcement: some bands of adventurers were
drawn from Spain, Lombardy, and England; <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> and from the distant bogs
and mountains of Ireland or Scotland <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> issued some naked and savage
fanatics, ferocious at home but unwarlike abroad. Had not superstition
condemned the sacrilegious prudence of depriving the poorest or weakest
Christian of the merit of the pilgrimage, the useless crowd, with mouths
but without hands, might have been stationed in the Greek empire, till
their companions had opened and secured the way of the Lord. A small
remnant of the pilgrims, who passed the Bosphorus, was permitted to
visit the holy sepulchre. Their northern constitution was scorched by
the rays, and infected by the vapors, of a Syrian sun. They consumed,
with heedless prodigality, their stores of water and provision: their
numbers exhausted the inland country: the sea was remote, the Greeks
were unfriendly, and the Christians of every sect fled before the
voracious and cruel rapine of their brethren. In the dire necessity of
famine, they sometimes roasted and devoured the flesh of their infant
or adult captives. Among the Turks and Saracens, the idolaters of Europe
were rendered more odious by the name and reputation of Cannibals; the
spies, who introduced themselves into the kitchen of Bohemond, were
shown several human bodies turning on the spit: and the artful Norman
encouraged a report, which increased at the same time the abhorrence and
the terror of the infidels. <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter LVIII: The First Crusade.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
I have expiated with pleasure on the first steps of the crusaders, as
they paint the manners and character of Europe: but I shall abridge the
tedious and uniform narrative of their blind achievements, which were
performed by strength and are described by ignorance. From their first
station in the neighborhood of Nicomedia, they advanced in successive
divisions; passed the contracted limit of the Greek empire; opened a
road through the hills, and commenced, by the siege of his capital,
their pious warfare against the Turkish sultan. His kingdom of Roum
extended from the Hellespont to the confines of Syria, and barred the
pilgrimage of Jerusalem, his name was Kilidge-Arslan, or Soliman,
<a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> of the race of Seljuk, and son of the first conqueror; and in the
defence of a land which the Turks considered as their own, he deserved
the praise of his enemies, by whom alone he is known to posterity.
Yielding to the first impulse of the torrent, he deposited his family
and treasure in Nice; retired to the mountains with fifty thousand
horse; and twice descended to assault the camps or quarters of the
Christian besiegers, which formed an imperfect circle of above six
miles. The lofty and solid walls of Nice were covered by a deep ditch,
and flanked by three hundred and seventy towers; and on the verge of
Christendom, the Moslems were trained in arms, and inflamed by religion.
Before this city, the French princes occupied their stations, and
prosecuted their attacks without correspondence or subordination:
emulation prompted their valor; but their valor was sullied by cruelty,
and their emulation degenerated into envy and civil discord. In the
siege of Nice, the arts and engines of antiquity were employed by the
Latins; the mine and the battering-ram, the tortoise, and the belfrey or
movable turret, artificial fire, and the catapult and balist, the sling,
and the crossbow for the casting of stones and darts. <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> In the space
of seven weeks much labor and blood were expended, and some progress,
especially by Count Raymond, was made on the side of the besiegers. But
the Turks could protract their resistance and secure their escape, as
long as they were masters of the Lake <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a> Ascanius, which stretches
several miles to the westward of the city. The means of conquest were
supplied by the prudence and industry of Alexius; a great number of
boats was transported on sledges from the sea to the lake; they were
filled with the most dexterous of his archers; the flight of the sultana
was intercepted; Nice was invested by land and water; and a Greek
emissary persuaded the inhabitants to accept his master's protection,
and to save themselves, by a timely surrender, from the rage of the
savages of Europe. In the moment of victory, or at least of hope, the
crusaders, thirsting for blood and plunder, were awed by the Imperial
banner that streamed from the citadel; <a href="#note-821" name="noteref-821"><small>821</small></a> and Alexius guarded with
jealous vigilance this important conquest. The murmurs of the chiefs
were stifled by honor or interest; and after a halt of nine days, they
directed their march towards Phrygia under the guidance of a Greek
general, whom they suspected of a secret connivance with the sultan.
The consort and the principal servants of Soliman had been honorably
restored without ransom; and the emperor's generosity to the miscreants
<a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> was interpreted as treason to the Christian cause.

[ Mecreant, a word invented by the French crusaders, and
confined in that language to its primitive sense. It should seem, that
the zeal of our ancestors boiled higher, and that they branded every
unbeliever as a rascal. A similar prejudice still lurks in the minds of
many who think themselves Christians.]
</p>
<p>
Soliman was rather provoked than dismayed by the loss of his capital:
he admonished his subjects and allies of this strange invasion of the
Western Barbarians; the Turkish emirs obeyed the call of loyalty or
religion; the Turkman hordes encamped round his standard; and his whole
force is loosely stated by the Christians at two hundred, or even three
hundred and sixty thousand horse. Yet he patiently waited till they had
left behind them the sea and the Greek frontier; and hovering on the
flanks, observed their careless and confident progress in two columns
beyond the view of each other. Some miles before they could reach
Dorylaeum in Phrygia, the left, and least numerous, division was
surprised, and attacked, and almost oppressed, by the Turkish cavalry.
<a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> The heat of the weather, the clouds of arrows, and the barbarous
onset, overwhelmed the crusaders; they lost their order and confidence,
and the fainting fight was sustained by the personal valor, rather than
by the military conduct, of Bohemond, Tancred, and Robert of Normandy.
They were revived by the welcome banners of Duke Godfrey, who flew to
their succor, with the count of Vermandois, and sixty thousand horse;
and was followed by Raymond of Tholouse, the bishop of Puy, and the
remainder of the sacred army. Without a moment's pause, they formed
in new order, and advanced to a second battle. They were received with
equal resolution; and, in their common disdain for the unwarlike people
of Greece and Asia, it was confessed on both sides, that the Turks
and the Franks were the only nations entitled to the appellation of
soldiers. <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> Their encounter was varied, and balanced by the contrast
of arms and discipline; of the direct charge, and wheeling evolutions;
of the couched lance, and the brandished javelin; of a weighty
broadsword, and a crooked sabre; of cumbrous armor, and thin flowing
robes; and of the long Tartar bow, and the arbalist or crossbow, a
deadly weapon, yet unknown to the Orientals. <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> As long as the horses
were fresh, and the quivers full, Soliman maintained the advantage
of the day; and four thousand Christians were pierced by the Turkish
arrows. In the evening, swiftness yielded to strength: on either side,
the numbers were equal or at least as great as any ground could hold, or
any generals could manage; but in turning the hills, the last division
of Raymond and his provincials was led, perhaps without design on the
rear of an exhausted enemy; and the long contest was determined. Besides
a nameless and unaccounted multitude, three thousand Pagan knights were
slain in the battle and pursuit; the camp of Soliman was pillaged; and
in the variety of precious spoil, the curiosity of the Latins was amused
with foreign arms and apparel, and the new aspect of dromedaries and
camels. The importance of the victory was proved by the hasty retreat
of the sultan: reserving ten thousand guards of the relics of his army,
Soliman evacuated the kingdom of Roum, and hastened to implore the aid,
and kindle the resentment, of his Eastern brethren. In a march of five
hundred miles, the crusaders traversed the Lesser Asia, through a wasted
land and deserted towns, without finding either a friend or an enemy.
The geographer <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a> may trace the position of Dorylaeum, Antioch of
Pisidia, Iconium, Archelais, and Germanicia, and may compare those
classic appellations with the modern names of Eskishehr the old city,
Akshehr the white city, Cogni, Erekli, and Marash. As the pilgrims
passed over a desert, where a draught of water is exchanged for silver,
they were tormented by intolerable thirst; and on the banks of the first
rivulet, their haste and intemperance were still more pernicious to
the disorderly throng. They climbed with toil and danger the steep and
slippery sides of Mount Taurus; many of the soldiers cast away their
arms to secure their footsteps; and had not terror preceded their van,
the long and trembling file might have been driven down the precipice by
a handful of resolute enemies. Two of their most respectable chiefs,
the duke of Lorraine and the count of Tholouse, were carried in litters:
Raymond was raised, as it is said by miracle, from a hopeless malady;
and Godfrey had been torn by a bear, as he pursued that rough and
perilous chase in the mountains of Pisidia.

To improve the general consternation, the cousin of Bohemond and
the brother of Godfrey were detached from the main army with their
respective squadrons of five, and of seven, hundred knights. They
overran in a rapid career the hills and sea-coast of Cilicia, from Cogni
to the Syrian gates: the Norman standard was first planted on the walls
of Tarsus and Malmistra; but the proud injustice of Baldwin at length
provoked the patient and generous Italian; and they turned their
consecrated swords against each other in a private and profane quarrel.
Honor was the motive, and fame the reward, of Tancred; but fortune
smiled on the more selfish enterprise of his rival. <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> He was called
to the assistance of a Greek or Armenian tyrant, who had been suffered
under the Turkish yoke to reign over the Christians of Edessa. Baldwin
accepted the character of his son and champion: but no sooner was he
introduced into the city, than he inflamed the people to the massacre
of his father, occupied the throne and treasure, extended his conquests
over the hills of Armenia and the plain of Mesopotamia, and founded the
first principality of the Franks or Latins, which subsisted fifty-four
years beyond the Euphrates. <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a>

<p>
Before the Franks could enter Syria, the summer, and even the autumn,
were completely wasted: the siege of Antioch, or the separation and
repose of the army during the winter season, was strongly debated in
their council: the love of arms and the holy sepulchre urged them to
advance; and reason perhaps was on the side of resolution, since every
hour of delay abates the fame and force of the invader, and multiplies
the resources of defensive war. The capital of Syria was protected by
the River Orontes; and the iron bridge, <a href="#note-891" name="noteref-891"><small>891</small></a> of nine arches, derives
its name from the massy gates of the two towers which are constructed at
either end. They were opened by the sword of the duke of Normandy: his
victory gave entrance to three hundred thousand crusaders, an account
which may allow some scope for losses and desertion, but which clearly
detects much exaggeration in the review of Nice. In the description of
Antioch, <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a> it is not easy to define a middle term between her ancient
magnificence, under the successors of Alexander and Augustus, and the
modern aspect of Turkish desolation. The Tetrapolis, or four cities, if
they retained their name and position, must have left a large vacuity in
a circumference of twelve miles; and that measure, as well as the number
of four hundred towers, are not perfectly consistent with the five
gates, so often mentioned in the history of the siege. Yet Antioch must
have still flourished as a great and populous capital. At the head of
the Turkish emirs, Baghisian, a veteran chief, commanded in the place:
his garrison was composed of six or seven thousand horse, and fifteen
or twenty thousand foot: one hundred thousand Moslems are said to have
fallen by the sword; and their numbers were probably inferior to the
Greeks, Armenians, and Syrians, who had been no more than fourteen
years the slaves of the house of Seljuk. From the remains of a solid and
stately wall, it appears to have arisen to the height of threescore feet
in the valleys; and wherever less art and labor had been applied, the
ground was supposed to be defended by the river, the morass, and the
mountains. Notwithstanding these fortifications, the city had been
repeatedly taken by the Persians, the Arabs, the Greeks, and the Turks;
so large a circuit must have yielded many pervious points of attack; and
in a siege that was formed about the middle of October, the vigor of
the execution could alone justify the boldness of the attempt. Whatever
strength and valor could perform in the field was abundantly discharged
by the champions of the cross: in the frequent occasions of sallies,
of forage, of the attack and defence of convoys, they were often
victorious; and we can only complain, that their exploits are sometimes
enlarged beyond the scale of probability and truth. The sword of Godfrey
<a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a> divided a Turk from the shoulder to the haunch; and one half of the
infidel fell to the ground, while the other was transported by his horse
to the city gate. As Robert of Normandy rode against his antagonist, "I
devote thy head," he piously exclaimed, "to the daemons of hell;" and
that head was instantly cloven to the breast by the resistless stroke of
his descending falchion. But the reality or the report of such gigantic
prowess <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> must have taught the Moslems to keep within their walls:
and against those walls of earth or stone, the sword and the lance were
unavailing weapons. In the slow and successive labors of a siege, the
crusaders were supine and ignorant, without skill to contrive, or money
to purchase, or industry to use, the artificial engines and implements
of assault. In the conquest of Nice, they had been powerfully assisted
by the wealth and knowledge of the Greek emperor: his absence was poorly
supplied by some Genoese and Pisan vessels, that were attracted by
religion or trade to the coast of Syria: the stores were scanty, the
return precarious, and the communication difficult and dangerous.
Indolence or weakness had prevented the Franks from investing the entire
circuit; and the perpetual freedom of two gates relieved the wants and
recruited the garrison of the city. At the end of seven months, after
the ruin of their cavalry, and an enormous loss by famine, desertion
and fatigue, the progress of the crusaders was imperceptible, and their
success remote, if the Latin Ulysses, the artful and ambitious Bohemond,
had not employed the arms of cunning and deceit. The Christians of
Antioch were numerous and discontented: Phirouz, a Syrian renegado, had
acquired the favor of the emir and the command of three towers; and the
merit of his repentance disguised to the Latins, and perhaps to himself,
the foul design of perfidy and treason. A secret correspondence, for
their mutual interest, was soon established between Phirouz and the
prince of Tarento; and Bohemond declared in the council of the chiefs,
that he could deliver the city into their hands. <a href="#note-921" name="noteref-921"><small>921</small></a> But he claimed
the sovereignty of Antioch as the reward of his service; and the
proposal which had been rejected by the envy, was at length extorted
from the distress, of his equals. The nocturnal surprise was executed
by the French and Norman princes, who ascended in person the
scaling-ladders that were thrown from the walls: their new proselyte,
after the murder of his too scrupulous brother, embraced and introduced
the servants of Christ; the army rushed through the gates; and the
Moslems soon found, that although mercy was hopeless, resistance was
impotent.
</p>
<p>
But the citadel still refused to surrender; and the victims themselves
were speedily encompassed and besieged by the innumerable forces of
Kerboga, prince of Mosul, who, with twenty-eight Turkish emirs, advanced
to the deliverance of Antioch. Five-and-twenty days the Christians spent
on the verge of destruction; and the proud lieutenant of the caliph and
the sultan left them only the choice of servitude or death. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> In this
extremity they collected the relics of their strength, sallied from the
town, and in a single memorable day, annihilated or dispersed the host
of Turks and Arabians, which they might safely report to have consisted
of six hundred thousand men. <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> Their supernatural allies I shall
proceed to consider: the human causes of the victory of Antioch were the
fearless despair of the Franks; and the surprise, the discord, perhaps
the errors, of their unskilful and presumptuous adversaries. The battle
is described with as much disorder as it was fought; but we may observe
the tent of Kerboga, a movable and spacious palace, enriched with the
luxury of Asia, and capable of holding above two thousand persons; we
may distinguish his three thousand guards, who were cased, the horse as
well as the men, in complete steel.

Comnena, (Alexias, l. xi. p. 318-320.) The numbers of the Turks are
fixed by Albert Aquensis at 200,000, (l. iv. c. 10, p. 242,) and by

In the eventful period of the siege and defence of Antioch, the
crusaders were alternately exalted by victory or sunk in despair; either
swelled with plenty or emaciated with hunger. A speculative reasoner
might suppose, that their faith had a strong and serious influence on
their practice; and that the soldiers of the cross, the deliverers of
the holy sepulchre, prepared themselves by a sober and virtuous life
for the daily contemplation of martyrdom. Experience blows away this
charitable illusion; and seldom does the history of profane war display
such scenes of intemperance and prostitution as were exhibited under
the walls of Antioch. The grove of Daphne no longer flourished; but the
Syrian air was still impregnated with the same vices; the Christians
were seduced by every temptation <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> that nature either prompts or
reprobates; the authority of the chiefs was despised; and sermons and
edicts were alike fruitless against those scandalous disorders, not less
pernicious to military discipline, than repugnant to evangelic purity.
In the first days of the siege and the possession of Antioch, the Franks
consumed with wanton and thoughtless prodigality the frugal subsistence
of weeks and months: the desolate country no longer yielded a supply;
and from that country they were at length excluded by the arms of the
besieging Turks. Disease, the faithful companion of want, was envenomed
by the rains of the winter, the summer heats, unwholesome food, and the
close imprisonment of multitudes. The pictures of famine and pestilence
are always the same, and always disgustful; and our imagination may
suggest the nature of their sufferings and their resources. The remains
of treasure or spoil were eagerly lavished in the purchase of the vilest
nourishment; and dreadful must have been the calamities of the poor,
since, after paying three marks of silver for a goat and fifteen for a
lean camel, <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> the count of Flanders was reduced to beg a dinner, and
Duke Godfrey to borrow a horse. Sixty thousand horse had been reviewed
in the camp: before the end of the siege they were diminished to two
thousand, and scarcely two hundred fit for service could be mustered on
the day of battle. Weakness of body and terror of mind extinguished
the ardent enthusiasm of the pilgrims; and every motive of honor and
religion was subdued by the desire of life. <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> Among the chiefs, three
heroes may be found without fear or reproach: Godfrey of Bouillon was
supported by his magnanimous piety; Bohemond by ambition and interest;
and Tancred declared, in the true spirit of chivalry, that as long as
he was at the head of forty knights, he would never relinquish the
enterprise of Palestine. But the count of Tholouse and Provence was
suspected of a voluntary indisposition; the duke of Normandy was
recalled from the sea-shore by the censures of the church: Hugh the
Great, though he led the vanguard of the battle, embraced an ambiguous
opportunity of returning to France and Stephen, count of Chartres,
basely deserted the standard which he bore, and the council in which
he presided. The soldiers were discouraged by the flight of William,
viscount of Melun, surnamed the Carpenter, from the weighty strokes of
his axe; and the saints were scandalized by the fall <a href="#note-971" name="noteref-971"><small>971</small></a> of Peter the
Hermit, who, after arming Europe against Asia, attempted to escape from
the penance of a necessary fast. Of the multitude of recreant warriors,
the names (says an historian) are blotted from the book of life; and the
opprobrious epithet of the rope-dancers was applied to the deserters
who dropped in the night from the walls of Antioch. The emperor Alexius,
<a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> who seemed to advance to the succor of the Latins, was dismayed by
the assurance of their hopeless condition. They expected their fate in
silent despair; oaths and punishments were tried without effect; and to
rouse the soldiers to the defence of the walls, it was found necessary
to set fire to their quarters.

<p>
For their salvation and victory, they were indebted to the same
fanaticism which had led them to the brink of ruin. In such a cause, and
in such an army, visions, prophecies, and miracles, were frequent and
familiar. In the distress of Antioch, they were repeated with unusual
energy and success: St. Ambrose had assured a pious ecclesiastic, that
two years of trial must precede the season of deliverance and grace; the
deserters were stopped by the presence and reproaches of Christ himself;
the dead had promised to arise and combat with their brethren; the
Virgin had obtained the pardon of their sins; and their confidence was
revived by a visible sign, the seasonable and splendid discovery of
the Holy Lance. The policy of their chiefs has on this occasion been
admired, and might surely be excused; but a pious baud is seldom
produced by the cool conspiracy of many persons; and a voluntary
impostor might depend on the support of the wise and the credulity of
the people. Of the diocese of Marseilles, there was a priest of low
cunning and loose manners, and his name was Peter Bartholemy. He
presented himself at the door of the council-chamber, to disclose an
apparition of St. Andrew, which had been thrice reiterated in his sleep
with a dreadful menace, if he presumed to suppress the commands of
Heaven. "At Antioch," said the apostle, "in the church of my brother
St. Peter, near the high altar, is concealed the steel head of the lance
that pierced the side of our Redeemer. In three days that instrument
of eternal, and now of temporal, salvation, will be manifested to his
disciples. Search, and ye shall find: bear it aloft in battle; and that
mystic weapon shall penetrate the souls of the miscreants." The
pope's legate, the bishop of Puy, affected to listen with coldness and
distrust; but the revelation was eagerly accepted by Count Raymond, whom
his faithful subject, in the name of the apostle, had chosen for the
guardian of the holy lance. The experiment was resolved; and on the
third day after a due preparation of prayer and fasting, the priest
of Marseilles introduced twelve trusty spectators, among whom were the
count and his chaplain; and the church doors were barred against the
impetuous multitude. The ground was opened in the appointed place; but
the workmen, who relieved each other, dug to the depth of twelve feet
without discovering the object of their search. In the evening, when
Count Raymond had withdrawn to his post, and the weary assistants began
to murmur, Bartholemy, in his shirt, and without his shoes, boldly
descended into the pit; the darkness of the hour and of the place
enabled him to secrete and deposit the head of a Saracen lance; and the
first sound, the first gleam, of the steel was saluted with a devout
rapture. The holy lance was drawn from its recess, wrapped in a veil
of silk and gold, and exposed to the veneration of the crusaders; their
anxious suspense burst forth in a general shout of joy and hope, and
the desponding troops were again inflamed with the enthusiasm of valor.
Whatever had been the arts, and whatever might be the sentiments of the
chiefs, they skilfully improved this fortunate revolution by every aid
that discipline and devotion could afford. The soldiers were dismissed
to their quarters with an injunction to fortify their minds and bodies
for the approaching conflict, freely to bestow their last pittance on
themselves and their horses, and to expect with the dawn of day the
signal of victory. On the festival of St. Peter and St. Paul, the gates
of Antioch were thrown open: a martial psalm, "Let the Lord arise, and
let his enemies be scattered!" was chanted by a procession of priests
and monks; the battle array was marshalled in twelve divisions, in honor
of the twelve apostles; and the holy lance, in the absence of Raymond,
was intrusted to the hands of his chaplain. The influence of his relic
or trophy, was felt by the servants, and perhaps by the enemies, of
Christ; <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> and its potent energy was heightened by an accident, a
stratagem, or a rumor, of a miraculous complexion. Three knights, in
white garments and resplendent arms, either issued, or seemed to issue,
from the hills: the voice of Adhemar, the pope's legate, proclaimed them
as the martyrs St. George, St. Theodore, and St. Maurice: the tumult of
battle allowed no time for doubt or scrutiny; and the welcome apparition
dazzled the eyes or the imagination of a fanatic army. <a href="#note-991" name="noteref-991"><small>991</small></a> In the
season of danger and triumph, the revelation of Bartholemy of Marseilles
was unanimously asserted; but as soon as the temporary service was
accomplished, the personal dignity and liberal arms which the count of
Tholouse derived from the custody of the holy lance, provoked the envy,
and awakened the reason, of his rivals. A Norman clerk presumed to sift,
with a philosophic spirit, the truth of the legend, the circumstances of
the discovery, and the character of the prophet; and the pious Bohemond
ascribed their deliverance to the merits and intercession of Christ
alone. For a while, the Provincials defended their national palladium
with clamors and arms and new visions condemned to death and hell the
profane sceptics who presumed to scrutinize the truth and merit of the
discovery. The prevalence of incredulity compelled the author to submit
his life and veracity to the judgment of God. A pile of dry fagots, four
feet high and fourteen long, was erected in the midst of the camp; the
flames burnt fiercely to the elevation of thirty cubits; and a narrow
path of twelve inches was left for the perilous trial. The unfortunate
priest of Marseilles traversed the fire with dexterity and speed; but
the thighs and belly were scorched by the intense heat; he expired the
next day; <a href="#note-992" name="noteref-992"><small>992</small></a> and the logic of believing minds will pay some regard to
his dying protestations of innocence and truth. Some efforts were made
by the Provincials to substitute a cross, a ring, or a tabernacle,
in the place of the holy lance, which soon vanished in contempt and
oblivion. <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> Yet the revelation of Antioch is gravely asserted by
succeeding historians: and such is the progress of credulity, that
miracles most doubtful on the spot, and at the moment, will be received
with implicit faith at a convenient distance of time and space.

<p>
The prudence or fortune of the Franks had delayed their invasion till
the decline of the Turkish empire. <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> Under the manly government of
the three first sultans, the kingdoms of Asia were united in peace and
justice; and the innumerable armies which they led in person were equal
in courage, and superior in discipline, to the Barbarians of the West.
But at the time of the crusade, the inheritance of Malek Shaw was
disputed by his four sons; their private ambition was insensible of
the public danger; and, in the vicissitudes of their fortune, the
royal vassals were ignorant, or regardless, of the true object of their
allegiance. The twenty-eight emirs who marched with the standard or
Kerboga were his rivals or enemies: their hasty levies were drawn from
the towns and tents of Mesopotamia and Syria; and the Turkish veterans
were employed or consumed in the civil wars beyond the Tigris. The
caliph of Egypt embraced this opportunity of weakness and discord
to recover his ancient possessions; and his sultan Aphdal besieged
Jerusalem and Tyre, expelled the children of Ortok, and restored in
Palestine the civil and ecclesiastical authority of the Fatimites. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a>
They heard with astonishment of the vast armies of Christians that had
passed from Europe to Asia, and rejoiced in the sieges and battles
which broke the power of the Turks, the adversaries of their sect and
monarchy. But the same Christians were the enemies of the prophet; and
from the overthrow of Nice and Antioch, the motive of their enterprise,
which was gradually understood, would urge them forwards to the banks of
the Jordan, or perhaps of the Nile.
</p>
<p>
An intercourse of epistles and embassies, which rose and fell with the
events of war, was maintained between the throne of Cairo and the camp
of the Latins; and their adverse pride was the result of ignorance and
enthusiasm. The ministers of Egypt declared in a haughty, or insinuated
in a milder, tone, that their sovereign, the true and lawful commander
of the faithful, had rescued Jerusalem from the Turkish yoke; and that
the pilgrims, if they would divide their numbers, and lay aside their
arms, should find a safe and hospitable reception at the sepulchre
of Jesus. In the belief of their lost condition, the caliph Mostali
despised their arms and imprisoned their deputies: the conquest and
victory of Antioch prompted him to solicit those formidable champions
with gifts of horses and silk robes, of vases, and purses of gold and
silver; and in his estimate of their merit or power, the first place was
assigned to Bohemond, and the second to Godfrey. In either fortune, the
answer of the crusaders was firm and uniform: they disdained to inquire
into the private claims or possessions of the followers of Mahomet;
whatsoever was his name or nation, the usurper of Jerusalem was
their enemy; and instead of prescribing the mode and terms of their
pilgrimage, it was only by a timely surrender of the city and province,
their sacred right, that he could deserve their alliance, or deprecate
their impending and irresistible attack. <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a>

Yet this attack, when they were within the view and reach of their
glorious prize, was suspended above ten months after the defeat of
Kerboga. The zeal and courage of the crusaders were chilled in the
moment of victory; and instead of marching to improve the consternation,
they hastily dispersed to enjoy the luxury, of Syria. The causes of this
strange delay may be found in the want of strength and subordination. In
the painful and various service of Antioch, the cavalry was annihilated;
many thousands of every rank had been lost by famine, sickness, and
desertion: the same abuse of plenty had been productive of a third
famine; and the alternative of intemperance and distress had generated
a pestilence, which swept away above fifty thousand of the pilgrims. Few
were able to command, and none were willing to obey; the domestic feuds,
which had been stifled by common fear, were again renewed in acts, or at
least in sentiments, of hostility; the fortune of Baldwin and Bohemond
excited the envy of their companions; the bravest knights were enlisted
for the defence of their new principalities; and Count Raymond exhausted
his troops and treasures in an idle expedition into the heart of Syria.
<a href="#note-1031" name="noteref-1031"><small>1031</small></a> The winter was consumed in discord and disorder; a sense of honor
and religion was rekindled in the spring; and the private soldiers, less
susceptible of ambition and jealousy, awakened with angry clamors the
indolence of their chiefs. In the month of May, the relics of this
mighty host proceeded from Antioch to Laodicea: about forty thousand
Latins, of whom no more than fifteen hundred horse, and twenty thousand
foot, were capable of immediate service. Their easy march was continued
between Mount Libanus and the sea-shore: their wants were liberally
supplied by the coasting traders of Genoa and Pisa; and they drew
large contributions from the emirs of Tripoli, Tyre, Sidon, Acre, and
Caesarea, who granted a free passage, and promised to follow the example
of Jerusalem. From Caesarea they advanced into the midland country;
their clerks recognized the sacred geography of Lydda, Ramla, Emmaus,
and Bethlem, <a href="#note-1032" name="noteref-1032"><small>1032</small></a> and as soon as they descried the holy city, the

<h2>
    Chapter LVIII: The First Crusade.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>
<p>
Jerusalem has derived some reputation from the number and importance of
her memorable sieges. It was not till after a long and obstinate contest
that Babylon and Rome could prevail against the obstinacy of the people,
the craggy ground that might supersede the necessity of fortifications,
and the walls and towers that would have fortified the most accessible
plain. <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> These obstacles were diminished in the age of the crusades.
The bulwarks had been completely destroyed and imperfectly restored: the
Jews, their nation, and worship, were forever banished; but nature is
less changeable than man, and the site of Jerusalem, though somewhat
softened and somewhat removed, was still strong against the assaults
of an enemy. By the experience of a recent siege, and a three years'
possession, the Saracens of Egypt had been taught to discern, and in
some degree to remedy, the defects of a place, which religion as well
as honor forbade them to resign. Aladin, or Iftikhar, the caliph's
lieutenant, was intrusted with the defence: his policy strove to
restrain the native Christians by the dread of their own ruin and
that of the holy sepulchre; to animate the Moslems by the assurance of
temporal and eternal rewards. His garrison is said to have consisted
of forty thousand Turks and Arabians; and if he could muster twenty
thousand of the inhabitants, it must be confessed that the besieged were
more numerous than the besieging army. <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> Had the diminished strength
and numbers of the Latins allowed them to grasp the whole circumference
of four thousand yards, (about two English miles and a half, <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a> to
what useful purpose should they have descended into the valley of Ben
Hinnom and torrent of Cedron, <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> or approach the precipices of the
south and east, from whence they had nothing either to hope or fear?
Their siege was more reasonably directed against the northern and
western sides of the city. Godfrey of Bouillon erected his standard on
the first swell of Mount Calvary: to the left, as far as St. Stephen's
gate, the line of attack was continued by Tancred and the two Roberts;
and Count Raymond established his quarters from the citadel to the foot
of Mount Sion, which was no longer included within the precincts of the
city. On the fifth day, the crusaders made a general assault, in the
fanatic hope of battering down the walls without engines, and of scaling
them without ladders. By the dint of brutal force, they burst the first
barrier; but they were driven back with shame and slaughter to the camp:
the influence of vision and prophecy was deadened by the too frequent
abuse of those pious stratagems; and time and labor were found to be
the only means of victory. The time of the siege was indeed fulfilled
in forty days, but they were forty days of calamity and anguish. A
repetition of the old complaint of famine may be imputed in some degree
to the voracious or disorderly appetite of the Franks; but the stony
soil of Jerusalem is almost destitute of water; the scanty springs and
hasty torrents were dry in the summer season; nor was the thirst of the
besiegers relieved, as in the city, by the artificial supply of cisterns
and aqueducts. The circumjacent country is equally destitute of trees
for the uses of shade or building, but some large beams were discovered
in a cave by the crusaders: a wood near Sichem, the enchanted grove of
Tasso, <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> was cut down: the necessary timber was transported to the
camp by the vigor and dexterity of Tancred; and the engines were framed
by some Genoese artists, who had fortunately landed in the harbor of
Jaffa. Two movable turrets were constructed at the expense, and in the
stations, of the duke of Lorraine and the count of Tholouse, and rolled
forwards with devout labor, not to the most accessible, but to the most
neglected, parts of the fortification. Raymond's Tower was reduced to
ashes by the fire of the besieged, but his colleague was more vigilant
and successful; <a href="#note-1091" name="noteref-1091"><small>1091</small></a> the enemies were driven by his archers from the
rampart; the draw-bridge was let down; and on a Friday, at three in the
afternoon, the day and hour of the passion, Godfrey of Bouillon stood
victorious on the walls of Jerusalem. His example was followed on every
side by the emulation of valor; and about four hundred and sixty years
after the conquest of Omar, the holy city was rescued from the Mahometan
yoke. In the pillage of public and private wealth, the adventurers had
agreed to respect the exclusive property of the first occupant; and the
spoils of the great mosque, seventy lamps and massy vases of gold
and silver, rewarded the diligence, and displayed the generosity, of
Tancred. A bloody sacrifice was offered by his mistaken votaries to the
God of the Christians: resistance might provoke but neither age nor sex
could mollify, their implacable rage: they indulged themselves three
days in a promiscuous massacre; <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> and the infection of the dead
bodies produced an epidemical disease. After seventy thousand Moslems
had been put to the sword, and the harmless Jews had been burnt in
their synagogue, they could still reserve a multitude of captives, whom
interest or lassitude persuaded them to spare. Of these savage heroes of
the cross, Tancred alone betrayed some sentiments of compassion; yet
we may praise the more selfish lenity of Raymond, who granted a
capitulation and safe-conduct to the garrison of the citadel. <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a>
The holy sepulchre was now free; and the bloody victors prepared to
accomplish their vow. Bareheaded and barefoot, with contrite hearts, and
in an humble posture, they ascended the hill of Calvary, amidst the loud
anthems of the clergy; kissed the stone which had covered the Savior of
the world; and bedewed with tears of joy and penitence the monument of
their redemption. This union of the fiercest and most tender passions
has been variously considered by two philosophers; by the one, <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> as
easy and natural; by the other, <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> as absurd and incredible. Perhaps
it is too rigorously applied to the same persons and the same hour; the
example of the virtuous Godfrey awakened the piety of his companions;
while they cleansed their bodies, they purified their minds; nor shall
I believe that the most ardent in slaughter and rapine were the foremost
in the procession to the holy sepulchre.

Eight days after this memorable event, which Pope Urban did not live to
hear, the Latin chiefs proceeded to the election of a king, to guard
and govern their conquests in Palestine. Hugh the Great, and Stephen of
Chartres, had retired with some loss of reputation, which they strove
to regain by a second crusade and an honorable death. Baldwin was
established at Edessa, and Bohemond at Antioch; and two Roberts, the
duke of Normandy <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> and the count of Flanders, preferred their fair
inheritance in the West to a doubtful competition or a barren sceptre.
The jealousy and ambition of Raymond were condemned by his own
followers, and the free, the just, the unanimous voice of the army
proclaimed Godfrey of Bouillon the first and most worthy of the
champions of Christendom. His magnanimity accepted a trust as full of
danger as of glory; but in a city where his Savior had been crowned with
thorns, the devout pilgrim rejected the name and ensigns of royalty;
and the founder of the kingdom of Jerusalem contented himself with the
modest title of Defender and Baron of the Holy Sepulchre. His government
of a single year, <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> too short for the public happiness, was
interrupted in the first fortnight by a summons to the field, by the
approach of the vizier or sultan of Egypt, who had been too slow to
prevent, but who was impatient to avenge, the loss of Jerusalem. His
total overthrow in the battle of Ascalon sealed the establishment of the
Latins in Syria, and signalized the valor of the French princes who in
this action bade a long farewell to the holy wars.
</p>
<p>
Some glory might be derived from the prodigious inequality of numbers,
though I shall not count the myriads of horse and foot <a href="#note-1151" name="noteref-1151"><small>1151</small></a> on the
side of the Fatimites; but, except three thousand Ethiopians or Blacks,
who were armed with flails or scourges of iron, the Barbarians of
the South fled on the first onset, and afforded a pleasing comparison
between the active valor of the Turks and the sloth and effeminacy of
the natives of Egypt. After suspending before the holy sepulchre the
sword and standard of the sultan, the new king (he deserves the title)
embraced his departing companions, and could retain only with the
gallant Tancred three hundred knights, and two thousand foot-soldiers
for the defence of Palestine. His sovereignty was soon attacked by a new
enemy, the only one against whom Godfrey was a coward. Adhemar, bishop
of Puy, who excelled both in council and action, had been swept away in
the last plague at Antioch: the remaining ecclesiastics preserved only
the pride and avarice of their character; and their seditious clamors
had required that the choice of a bishop should precede that of a king.
The revenue and jurisdiction of the lawful patriarch were usurped by the
Latin clergy: the exclusion of the Greeks and Syrians was justified
by the reproach of heresy or schism; <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> and, under the iron yoke
of their deliverers, the Oriental Christians regretted the tolerating
government of the Arabian caliphs. Daimbert, archbishop of Pisa, had
long been trained in the secret policy of Rome: he brought a fleet
at his countrymen to the succor of the Holy Land, and was installed,
without a competitor, the spiritual and temporal head of the church.
<a href="#note-1161" name="noteref-1161"><small>1161</small></a> The new patriarch <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> immediately grasped the sceptre which had
been acquired by the toil and blood of the victorious pilgrims; and both
Godfrey and Bohemond submitted to receive at his hands the investiture
of their feudal possessions. Nor was this sufficient; Daimbert claimed
the immediate property of Jerusalem and Jaffa; instead of a firm and
generous refusal, the hero negotiated with the priest; a quarter of
either city was ceded to the church; and the modest bishop was satisfied
with an eventual reversion of the rest, on the death of Godfrey without
children, or on the future acquisition of a new seat at Cairo or
Damascus.

<p>
Without this indulgence, the conqueror would have almost been stripped
of his infant kingdom, which consisted only of Jerusalem and Jaffa, with
about twenty villages and towns of the adjacent country. <a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a> Within
this narrow verge, the Mahometans were still lodged in some impregnable
castles: and the husbandman, the trader, and the pilgrim, were exposed
to daily and domestic hostility. By the arms of Godfrey himself, and of
the two Baldwins, his brother and cousin, who succeeded to the throne,
the Latins breathed with more ease and safety; and at length they
equalled, in the extent of their dominions, though not in the millions
of their subjects, the ancient princes of Judah and Israel. <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a> After
the reduction of the maritime cities of Laodicea, Tripoli, Tyre, and
Ascalon, <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> which were powerfully assisted by the fleets of Venice,
Genoa, and Pisa, and even of Flanders and Norway, <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a> the range of
sea-coast from Scanderoon to the borders of Egypt was possessed by the
Christian pilgrims. If the prince of Antioch disclaimed his supremacy,
the counts of Edessa and Tripoli owned themselves the vassals of the
king of Jerusalem: the Latins reigned beyond the Euphrates; and the four
cities of Hems, Hamah, Damascus, and Aleppo, were the only relics of the
Mahometan conquests in Syria. <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> The laws and language, the manners
and titles, of the French nation and Latin church, were introduced into
these transmarine colonies. According to the feudal jurisprudence, the
principal states and subordinate baronies descended in the line of male
and female succession: <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a> but the children of the first conquerors,
<a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a> a motley and degenerate race, were dissolved by the luxury of the
climate; the arrival of new crusaders from Europe was a doubtful
hope and a casual event. The service of the feudal tenures <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a> was
performed by six hundred and sixty-six knights, who might expect the aid
of two hundred more under the banner of the count of Tripoli; and
each knight was attended to the field by four squires or archers on
horseback. <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> Five thousand and seventy sergeants, most probably
foot-soldiers, were supplied by the churches and cities; and the whole
legal militia of the kingdom could not exceed eleven thousand men, a
slender defence against the surrounding myriads of Saracens and Turks.
<a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a> But the firmest bulwark of Jerusalem was founded on the knights of
the Hospital of St. John, <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> and of the temple of Solomon; <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a>
on the strange association of a monastic and military life, which
fanaticism might suggest, but which policy must approve. The flower of
the nobility of Europe aspired to wear the cross, and to profess the
vows, of these respectable orders; their spirit and discipline were
immortal; and the speedy donation of twenty-eight thousand farms, or
manors, <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> enabled them to support a regular force of cavalry and
infantry for the defence of Palestine. The austerity of the convent soon
evaporated in the exercise of arms; the world was scandalized by the
pride, avarice, and corruption of these Christian soldiers; their claims
of immunity and jurisdiction disturbed the harmony of the church and
state; and the public peace was endangered by their jealous emulation.
But in their most dissolute period, the knights of their hospital and
temple maintained their fearless and fanatic character: they neglected
to live, but they were prepared to die, in the service of Christ; and
the spirit of chivalry, the parent and offspring of the crusades, has
been transplanted by this institution from the holy sepulchre to the
Isle of Malta. <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a>

The spirit of freedom, which pervades the feudal institutions, was felt
in its strongest energy by the volunteers of the cross, who elected for
their chief the most deserving of his peers. Amidst the slaves of Asia,
unconscious of the lesson or example, a model of political liberty was
introduced; and the laws of the French kingdom are derived from the
purest source of equality and justice. Of such laws, the first and
indispensable condition is the assent of those whose obedience they
require, and for whose benefit they are designed. No sooner had Godfrey
of Bouillon accepted the office of supreme magistrate, than he solicited
the public and private advice of the Latin pilgrims, who were the best
skilled in the statutes and customs of Europe. From these materials,
with the counsel and approbation of the patriarch and barons, of the
clergy and laity, Godfrey composed the Assise of Jerusalem, <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a> a
precious monument of feudal jurisprudence. The new code, attested by
the seals of the king, the patriarch, and the viscount of Jerusalem,
was deposited in the holy sepulchre, enriched with the improvements of
succeeding times, and respectfully consulted as often as any doubtful
question arose in the tribunals of Palestine. With the kingdom and city
all was lost: <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> the fragments of the written law were preserved by

The justice and freedom of the constitution were maintained by two
tribunals of unequal dignity, which were instituted by Godfrey of
Bouillon after the conquest of Jerusalem. The king, in person, presided
in the upper court, the court of the barons. Of these the four most
conspicuous were the prince of Galilee, the lord of Sidon and Caesarea,
and the counts of Jaffa and Tripoli, who, perhaps with the constable and
marshal, <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a> were in a special manner the compeers and judges of
each other. But all the nobles, who held their lands immediately of
the crown, were entitled and bound to attend the king's court; and each
baron exercised a similar jurisdiction on the subordinate assemblies of
his own feudatories. The connection of lord and vassal was honorable
and voluntary: reverence was due to the benefactor, protection to the
dependant; but they mutually pledged their faith to each other; and the
obligation on either side might be suspended by neglect or dissolved
by injury. The cognizance of marriages and testaments was blended with
religion, and usurped by the clergy: but the civil and criminal causes
of the nobles, the inheritance and tenure of their fiefs, formed the
proper occupation of the supreme court. Each member was the judge and
guardian both of public and private rights. It was his duty to assert
with his tongue and sword the lawful claims of the lord; but if an
unjust superior presumed to violate the freedom or property of a vassal,
the confederate peers stood forth to maintain his quarrel by word and
deed. They boldly affirmed his innocence and his wrongs; demanded the
restitution of his liberty or his lands; suspended, after a fruitless
demand, their own service; rescued their brother from prison; and
employed every weapon in his defence, without offering direct violence
to the person of their lord, which was ever sacred in their eyes. <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a>
In their pleadings, replies, and rejoinders, the advocates of the court
were subtle and copious; but the use of argument and evidence was often
superseded by judicial combat; and the Assise of Jerusalem admits in
many cases this barbarous institution, which has been slowly abolished
by the laws and manners of Europe.

The trial by battle was established in all criminal cases which
affected the life, or limb, or honor, of any person; and in all civil
transactions, of or above the value of one mark of silver. It appears
that in criminal cases the combat was the privilege of the accuser, who,
except in a charge of treason, avenged his personal injury, or the death
of those persons whom he had a right to represent; but wherever, from
the nature of the charge, testimony could be obtained, it was necessary
for him to produce witnesses of the fact. In civil cases, the combat was
not allowed as the means of establishing the claim of the demandant;
but he was obliged to produce witnesses who had, or assumed to have,
knowledge of the fact. The combat was then the privilege of the
defendant; because he charged the witness with an attempt by perjury to
take away his right. He came therefore to be in the same situation as
the appellant in criminal cases. It was not then as a mode of proof that
the combat was received, nor as making negative evidence, (according
to the supposition of Montesquieu; <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a> but in every case the right to
offer battle was founded on the right to pursue by arms the redress of
an injury; and the judicial combat was fought on the same principle, and
with the same spirit, as a private duel. Champions were only allowed to
women, and to men maimed or past the age of sixty. The consequence of a
defeat was death to the person accused, or to the champion or witness,
as well as to the accuser himself: but in civil cases, the demandant
was punished with infamy and the loss of his suit, while his witness and
champion suffered ignominious death. In many cases it was in the option
of the judge to award or to refuse the combat: but two are specified,
in which it was the inevitable result of the challenge; if a faithful
vassal gave the lie to his compeer, who unjustly claimed any portion of
their lord's demesnes; or if an unsuccessful suitor presumed to impeach
the judgment and veracity of the court. He might impeach them, but the
terms were severe and perilous: in the same day he successively fought
all the members of the tribunal, even those who had been absent; a
single defeat was followed by death and infamy; and where none could
hope for victory, it is highly probable that none would adventure the
trial. In the Assise of Jerusalem, the legal subtlety of the count
of Jaffa is more laudably employed to elude, than to facilitate, the
judicial combat, which he derives from a principle of honor rather than
of superstition. <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a>

Among the causes which enfranchised the plebeians from the yoke of
feudal tyranny, the institution of cities and corporations is one of
the most powerful; and if those of Palestine are coeval with the first
crusade, they may be ranked with the most ancient of the Latin world.
Many of the pilgrims had escaped from their lords under the banner of
the cross; and it was the policy of the French princes to tempt their
stay by the assurance of the rights and privileges of freemen. It is
expressly declared in the Assise of Jerusalem, that after instituting,
for his knights and barons, the court of peers, in which he presided
himself, Godfrey of Bouillon established a second tribunal, in which
his person was represented by his viscount. The jurisdiction of this
inferior court extended over the burgesses of the kingdom; and it was
composed of a select number of the most discreet and worthy citizens,
who were sworn to judge, according to the laws of the actions and
fortunes of their equals. <a href="#note-141" name="noteref-141"><small>141</small></a> In the conquest and settlement of new
cities, the example of Jerusalem was imitated by the kings and their
great vassals; and above thirty similar corporations were founded before
the loss of the Holy Land. Another class of subjects, the Syrians, <a href="#note-142" name="noteref-142"><small>142</small></a>
or Oriental Christians, were oppressed by the zeal of the clergy, and
protected by the toleration of the state. Godfrey listened to their
reasonable prayer, that they might be judged by their own national laws.
A third court was instituted for their use, of limited and domestic
jurisdiction: the sworn members were Syrians, in blood, language, and
religion; but the office of the president (in Arabic, of the rais) was
sometimes exercised by the viscount of the city. At an immeasurable
distance below the nobles, the burgesses, and the strangers, the
Assise of Jerusalem condescends to mention the villains and slaves, the
peasants of the land and the captives of war, who were almost equally
considered as the objects of property. The relief or protection of these
unhappy men was not esteemed worthy of the care of the legislator;
but he diligently provides for the recovery, though not indeed for the
punishment, of the fugitives. Like hounds, or hawks, who had strayed
from the lawful owner, they might be lost and claimed: the slave and
falcon were of the same value; but three slaves, or twelve oxen, were
accumulated to equal the price of the war-horse; and a sum of three
hundred pieces of gold was fixed, in the age of chivalry, as the
equivalent of the more noble animal. <a href="#note-143" name="noteref-143"><small>143</small></a>
