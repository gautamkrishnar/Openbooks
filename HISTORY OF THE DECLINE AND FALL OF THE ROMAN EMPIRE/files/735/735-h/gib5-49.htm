<p>
In the connection of the church and state, I have considered the former
as subservient only, and relative, to the latter; a salutary maxim,
if in fact, as well as in narrative, it had ever been held sacred. The
Oriental philosophy of the Gnostics, the dark abyss of predestination
and grace, and the strange transformation of the Eucharist from the sign
to the substance of Christ's body, <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> I have purposely abandoned to the
curiosity of speculative divines. But I have reviewed, with diligence
and pleasure, the objects of ecclesiastical history, by which the
decline and fall of the Roman empire were materially affected, the
propagation of Christianity, the constitution of the Catholic church,
the ruin of Paganism, and the sects that arose from the mysterious
controversies concerning the Trinity and incarnation. At the head
of this class, we may justly rank the worship of images, so fiercely
disputed in the eighth and ninth centuries; since a question of popular
superstition produced the revolt of Italy, the temporal power of the
popes, and the restoration of the Roman empire in the West.

[ The learned Selden has given the history of
transubstantiation in a comprehensive and pithy sentence: "This opinion
is only rhetoric turned into logic," (his Works, vol. iii. p. 2037, in
his Table-Talk.)]
</p>
<p>
The primitive Christians were possessed with an unconquerable repugnance
to the use and abuse of images; and this aversion may be ascribed to
their descent from the Jews, and their enmity to the Greeks. The Mosaic
law had severely proscribed all representations of the Deity; and that
precept was firmly established in the principles and practice of the
chosen people. The wit of the Christian apologists was pointed against
the foolish idolaters, who bowed before the workmanship of their own
hands; the images of brass and marble, which, had they been endowed with
sense and motion, should have started rather from the pedestal to adore
the creative powers of the artist. <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> Perhaps some recent and imperfect
converts of the Gnostic tribe might crown the statues of Christ and St.
Paul with the profane honors which they paid to those of Aristotle and
Pythagoras; <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> but the public religion of the Catholics was uniformly
simple and spiritual; and the first notice of the use of pictures is in
the censure of the council of Illiberis, three hundred years after the
Christian aera. Under the successors of Constantine, in the peace and
luxury of the triumphant church, the more prudent bishops condescended
to indulge a visible superstition, for the benefit of the multitude;
and, after the ruin of Paganism, they were no longer restrained by the
apprehension of an odious parallel. The first introduction of a symbolic
worship was in the veneration of the cross, and of relics. The saints
and martyrs, whose intercession was implored, were seated on the right
hand if God; but the gracious and often supernatural favors, which,
in the popular belief, were showered round their tomb, conveyed an
unquestionable sanction of the devout pilgrims, who visited, and
touched, and kissed these lifeless remains, the memorials of their
merits and sufferings. <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> But a memorial, more interesting than the
skull or the sandals of a departed worthy, is the faithful copy of his
person and features, delineated by the arts of painting or sculpture.
In every age, such copies, so congenial to human feelings, have been
cherished by the zeal of private friendship, or public esteem: the
images of the Roman emperors were adored with civil, and almost
religious, honors; a reverence less ostentatious, but more sincere, was
applied to the statues of sages and patriots; and these profane virtues,
these splendid sins, disappeared in the presence of the holy men, who
had died for their celestial and everlasting country. At first, the
experiment was made with caution and scruple; and the venerable pictures
were discreetly allowed to instruct the ignorant, to awaken the cold,
and to gratify the prejudices of the heathen proselytes. By a slow
though inevitable progression, the honors of the original were
transferred to the copy: the devout Christian prayed before the image of
a saint; and the Pagan rites of genuflection, luminaries, and incense,
again stole into the Catholic church. The scruples of reason, or piety,
were silenced by the strong evidence of visions and miracles; and the
pictures which speak, and move, and bleed, must be endowed with a
divine energy, and may be considered as the proper objects of religious
adoration. The most audacious pencil might tremble in the rash attempt
of defining, by forms and colors, the infinite Spirit, the eternal
Father, who pervades and sustains the universe. <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> But the
superstitious mind was more easily reconciled to paint and to worship
the angels, and, above all, the Son of God, under the human shape,
which, on earth, they have condescended to assume. The second person of
the Trinity had been clothed with a real and mortal body; but that body
had ascended into heaven: and, had not some similitude been presented
to the eyes of his disciples, the spiritual worship of Christ might
have been obliterated by the visible relics and representations of the
saints. A similar indulgence was requisite and propitious for the Virgin
Mary: the place of her burial was unknown; and the assumption of her
soul and body into heaven was adopted by the credulity of the Greeks and
Latins. The use, and even the worship, of images was firmly established
before the end of the sixth century: they were fondly cherished by the
warm imagination of the Greeks and Asiatics: the Pantheon and Vatican
were adorned with the emblems of a new superstition; but this semblance
of idolatry was more coldly entertained by the rude Barbarians and the
Arian clergy of the West. The bolder forms of sculpture, in brass or
marble, which peopled the temples of antiquity, were offensive to the
fancy or conscience of the Christian Greeks: and a smooth surface
of colors has ever been esteemed a more decent and harmless mode of
imitation. <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The merit and effect of a copy depends on its resemblance with the
original; but the primitive Christians were ignorant of the genuine
features of the Son of God, his mother, and his apostles: the statue
of Christ at Paneas in Palestine <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> was more probably that of
some temporal savior; the Gnostics and their profane monuments were
reprobated; and the fancy of the Christian artists could only be guided
by the clandestine imitation of some heathen model. In this distress, a
bold and dexterous invention assured at once the likeness of the image
and the innocence of the worship. A new super structure of fable was
raised on the popular basis of a Syrian legend, on the correspondence
of Christ and Abgarus, so famous in the days of Eusebius, so reluctantly
deserted by our modern advocates. The bishop of Caesarea <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> records the
epistle, <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> but he most strangely forgets the picture of Christ; <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a>
the perfect impression of his face on a linen, with which he gratified
the faith of the royal stranger who had invoked his healing power, and
offered the strong city of Edessa to protect him against the malice of
the Jews. The ignorance of the primitive church is explained by the long
imprisonment of the image in a niche of the wall, from whence, after an
oblivion of five hundred years, it was released by some prudent bishop,
and seasonably presented to the devotion of the times. Its first and
most glorious exploit was the deliverance of the city from the arms of
Chosroes Nushirvan; and it was soon revered as a pledge of the divine
promise, that Edessa should never be taken by a foreign enemy. It is
true, indeed, that the text of Procopius ascribes the double deliverance
of Edessa to the wealth and valor of her citizens, who purchased
the absence and repelled the assaults of the Persian monarch. He was
ignorant, the profane historian, of the testimony which he is compelled
to deliver in the ecclesiastical page of Evagrius, that the Palladium
was exposed on the rampart, and that the water which had been sprinkled
on the holy face, instead of quenching, added new fuel to the flames
of the besieged. After this important service, the image of Edessa was
preserved with respect and gratitude; and if the Armenians rejected the
legend, the more credulous Greeks adored the similitude, which was not
the work of any mortal pencil, but the immediate creation of the divine
original. The style and sentiments of a Byzantine hymn will declare how
far their worship was removed from the grossest idolatry. "How can we
with mortal eyes contemplate this image, whose celestial splendor
the host of heaven presumes not to behold? He who dwells in heaven,
condescends this day to visit us by his venerable image; He who is
seated on the cherubim, visits us this day by a picture, which the
Father has delineated with his immaculate hand, which he has formed in
an ineffable manner, and which we sanctify by adoring it with fear and
love." Before the end of the sixth century, these images, made without
hands, (in Greek it is a single word, <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> were propagated in the camps
and cities of the Eastern empire: <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> they were the objects of worship,
and the instruments of miracles; and in the hour of danger or tumult,
their venerable presence could revive the hope, rekindle the courage,
or repress the fury, of the Roman legions. Of these pictures, the far
greater part, the transcripts of a human pencil, could only pretend to
a secondary likeness and improper title: but there were some of higher
descent, who derived their resemblance from an immediate contact with
the original, endowed, for that purpose, with a miraculous and prolific
virtue. The most ambitious aspired from a filial to a fraternal relation
with the image of Edessa; and such is the veronica of Rome, or Spain,
or Jerusalem, which Christ in his agony and bloody sweat applied to
his face, and delivered to a holy matron. The fruitful precedent was
speedily transferred to the Virgin Mary, and the saints and martyrs. In
the church of Diospolis, in Palestine, the features of the Mother of God
<a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> were deeply inscribed in a marble column; the East and West have
been decorated by the pencil of St. Luke; and the Evangelist, who was
perhaps a physician, has been forced to exercise the occupation of a
painter, so profane and odious in the eyes of the primitive Christians.
The Olympian Jove, created by the muse of Homer and the chisel of
Phidias, might inspire a philosophic mind with momentary devotion; but
these Catholic images were faintly and flatly delineated by monkish
artists in the last degeneracy of taste and genius. <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a>

[ After removing some rubbish of miracle and inconsistency,
it may be allowed, that as late as the year 300, Paneas in Palestine was
decorated with a bronze statue, representing a grave personage wrapped
in a cloak, with a grateful or suppliant female kneeling before him,
and that an inscription was perhaps inscribed on the pedestal. By the
Christians, this group was foolishly explained of their founder and
the poor woman whom he had cured of the bloody flux, (Euseb. vii. 18,
Philostorg. vii. 3, &amp;c.) M. de Beausobre more reasonably conjectures
the philosopher Apollonius, or the emperor Vespasian: in the latter
supposition, the female is a city, a province, or perhaps the queen
Berenice, (Bibliotheque Germanique, tom. xiii. p. 1-92.)]

</p>
<p>
The worship of images had stolen into the church by insensible
degrees, and each petty step was pleasing to the superstitious mind, as
productive of comfort, and innocent of sin. But in the beginning of the
eighth century, in the full magnitude of the abuse, the more timorous
Greeks were awakened by an apprehension, that under the mask of
Christianity, they had restored the religion of their fathers: they
heard, with grief and impatience, the name of idolaters; the incessant
charge of the Jews and Mahometans, <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> who derived from the Law and the
Koran an immortal hatred to graven images and all relative worship.
The servitude of the Jews might curb their zeal, and depreciate their
authority; but the triumphant Mussulmans, who reigned at Damascus,
and threatened Constantinople, cast into the scale of reproach the
accumulated weight of truth and victory. The cities of Syria, Palestine,
and Egypt had been fortified with the images of Christ, his mother, and
his saints; and each city presumed on the hope or promise of miraculous
defence. In a rapid conquest of ten years, the Arabs subdued those
cities and these images; and, in their opinion, the Lord of Hosts
pronounced a decisive judgment between the adoration and contempt of
these mute and inanimate idols. <a href="#note-1511" name="noteref-1511"><small>1511</small></a> For a while Edessa had braved
the Persian assaults; but the chosen city, the spouse of Christ, was
involved in the common ruin; and his divine resemblance became the slave
and trophy of the infidels. After a servitude of three hundred years,
the Palladium was yielded to the devotion of Constantinople, for a
ransom of twelve thousand pounds of silver, the redemption of two
hundred Mussulmans, and a perpetual truce for the territory of Edessa.
<a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> In this season of distress and dismay, the eloquence of the monks
was exercised in the defence of images; and they attempted to prove,
that the sin and schism of the greatest part of the Orientals had
forfeited the favor, and annihilated the virtue, of these precious
symbols. But they were now opposed by the murmurs of many simple or
rational Christians, who appealed to the evidence of texts, of facts,
and of the primitive times, and secretly desired the reformation of
the church. As the worship of images had never been established by any
general or positive law, its progress in the Eastern empire had been
retarded, or accelerated, by the differences of men and manners, the
local degrees of refinement, and the personal characters of the bishops.
The splendid devotion was fondly cherished by the levity of the capital,
and the inventive genius of the Byzantine clergy; while the rude and
remote districts of Asia were strangers to this innovation of sacred
luxury. Many large congregations of Gnostics and Arians maintained,
after their conversion, the simple worship which had preceded their
separation; and the Armenians, the most warlike subjects of Rome, were
not reconciled, in the twelfth century, to the sight of images. <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a>
These various denominations of men afforded a fund of prejudice and
aversion, of small account in the villages of Anatolia or Thrace, but
which, in the fortune of a soldier, a prelate, or a eunuch, might be
often connected with the powers of the church and state.

<p>
Of such adventurers, the most fortunate was the emperor Leo the Third,
<a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> who, from the mountains of Isauria, ascended the throne of the
East. He was ignorant of sacred and profane letters; but his education,
his reason, perhaps his intercourse with the Jews and Arabs, had
inspired the martial peasant with a hatred of images; and it was held
to be the duty of a prince to impose on his subjects the dictates of
his own conscience. But in the outset of an unsettled reign, during ten
years of toil and danger, Leo submitted to the meanness of hypocrisy,
bowed before the idols which he despised, and satisfied the Roman
pontiff with the annual professions of his orthodoxy and zeal. In the
reformation of religion, his first steps were moderate and cautious:
he assembled a great council of senators and bishops, and enacted, with
their consent, that all the images should be removed from the sanctuary
and altar to a proper height in the churches where they might be visible
to the eyes, and inaccessible to the superstition, of the people. But it
was impossible on either side to check the rapid through adverse impulse
of veneration and abhorrence: in their lofty position, the sacred images
still edified their votaries, and reproached the tyrant. He was himself
provoked by resistance and invective; and his own party accused him
of an imperfect discharge of his duty, and urged for his imitation the
example of the Jewish king, who had broken without scruple the brazen
serpent of the temple. By a second edict, he proscribed the existence
as well as the use of religious pictures; the churches of Constantinople
and the provinces were cleansed from idolatry; the images of Christ, the
Virgin, and the saints, were demolished, or a smooth surface of plaster
was spread over the walls of the edifice. The sect of the Iconoclasts
was supported by the zeal and despotism of six emperors, and the East
and West were involved in a noisy conflict of one hundred and
twenty years. It was the design of Leo the Isaurian to pronounce the
condemnation of images as an article of faith, and by the authority of
a general council: but the convocation of such an assembly was reserved
for his son Constantine; <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> and though it is stigmatized by triumphant
bigotry as a meeting of fools and atheists, their own partial and
mutilated acts betray many symptoms of reason and piety. The debates and
decrees of many provincial synods introduced the summons of the general
council which met in the suburbs of Constantinople, and was composed
of the respectable number of three hundred and thirty-eight bishops of
Europe and Anatolia; for the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria
were the slaves of the caliph, and the Roman pontiff had withdrawn the
churches of Italy and the West from the communion of the Greeks. This
Byzantine synod assumed the rank and powers of the seventh general
council; yet even this title was a recognition of the six preceding
assemblies, which had laboriously built the structure of the Catholic
faith. After a serious deliberation of six months, the three hundred and
thirty-eight bishops pronounced and subscribed a unanimous decree, that
all visible symbols of Christ, except in the Eucharist, were either
blasphemous or heretical; that image-worship was a corruption of
Christianity and a renewal of Paganism; that all such monuments of
idolatry should be broken or erased; and that those who should refuse
to deliver the objects of their private superstition, were guilty of
disobedience to the authority of the church and of the emperor. In
their loud and loyal acclamations, they celebrated the merits of their
temporal redeemer; and to his zeal and justice they intrusted the
execution of their spiritual censures. At Constantinople, as in the
former councils, the will of the prince was the rule of episcopal faith;
but on this occasion, I am inclined to suspect that a large majority of
the prelates sacrificed their secret conscience to the temptations of
hope and fear. In the long night of superstition, the Christians had
wandered far away from the simplicity of the gospel: nor was it easy for
them to discern the clew, and tread back the mazes, of the labyrinth.
The worship of images was inseparably blended, at least to a pious
fancy, with the Cross, the Virgin, the Saints and their relics; the holy
ground was involved in a cloud of miracles and visions; and the nerves
of the mind, curiosity and scepticism, were benumbed by the habits of
obedience and belief. Constantine himself is accused of indulging
a royal license to doubt, or deny, or deride the mysteries of the
Catholics, <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> but they were deeply inscribed in the public and private
creed of his bishops; and the boldest Iconoclast might assault with a
secret horror the monuments of popular devotion, which were consecrated
to the honor of his celestial patrons. In the reformation of the
sixteenth century, freedom and knowledge had expanded all the faculties
of man: the thirst of innovation superseded the reverence of antiquity;
and the vigor of Europe could disdain those phantoms which terrified the
sickly and servile weakness of the Greeks.

The scandal of an abstract heresy can be only proclaimed to the people
by the blast of the ecclesiastical trumpet; but the most ignorant can
perceive, the most torpid must feel, the profanation and downfall
of their visible deities. The first hostilities of Leo were directed
against a lofty Christ on the vestibule, and above the gate, of the
palace. A ladder had been planted for the assault, but it was furiously
shaken by a crowd of zealots and women: they beheld, with pious
transport, the ministers of sacrilege tumbling from on high and dashed
against the pavement: and the honors of the ancient martyrs were
prostituted to these criminals, who justly suffered for murder and
rebellion. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> The execution of the Imperial edicts was resisted by
frequent tumults in Constantinople and the provinces: the person of Leo
was endangered, his officers were massacred, and the popular enthusiasm
was quelled by the strongest efforts of the civil and military power.
Of the Archipelago, or Holy Sea, the numerous islands were filled with
images and monks: their votaries abjured, without scruple, the enemy
of Christ, his mother, and the saints; they armed a fleet of boats and
galleys, displayed their consecrated banners, and boldly steered for the
harbor of Constantinople, to place on the throne a new favorite of God
and the people. They depended on the succor of a miracle: but their
miracles were inefficient against the Greek fire; and, after the defeat
and conflagration of the fleet, the naked islands were abandoned to the
clemency or justice of the conqueror. The son of Leo, in the first year
of his reign, had undertaken an expedition against the Saracens: during
his absence, the capital, the palace, and the purple, were occupied by
his kinsman Artavasdes, the ambitious champion of the orthodox faith.
The worship of images was triumphantly restored: the patriarch renounced
his dissimulation, or dissembled his sentiments and the righteous claims
of the usurper was acknowledged, both in the new, and in ancient, Rome.
Constantine flew for refuge to his paternal mountains; but he descended
at the head of the bold and affectionate Isaurians; and his final
victory confounded the arms and predictions of the fanatics. His long
reign was distracted with clamor, sedition, conspiracy, and mutual
hatred, and sanguinary revenge; the persecution of images was the motive
or pretence, of his adversaries; and, if they missed a temporal diadem,
they were rewarded by the Greeks with the crown of martyrdom. In every
act of open and clandestine treason, the emperor felt the unforgiving
enmity of the monks, the faithful slaves of the superstition to which
they owed their riches and influence. They prayed, they preached, they
absolved, they inflamed, they conspired; the solitude of Palestine
poured forth a torrent of invective; and the pen of St. John Damascenus,
<a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> the last of the Greek fathers, devoted the tyrant's head, both in
this world and the next. <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> <a href="#note-2311" name="noteref-2311"><small>2311</small></a> I am not at leisure to examine how
far the monks provoked, nor how much they have exaggerated, their real
and pretended sufferings, nor how many lost their lives or limbs, their
eyes or their beards, by the cruelty of the emperor. <a href="#note-2312" name="noteref-2312"><small>2312</small></a> From the
chastisement of individuals, he proceeded to the abolition of the order;
and, as it was wealthy and useless, his resentment might be stimulated
by avarice, and justified by patriotism. The formidable name and
mission of the Dragon, <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> his visitor-general, excited the terror
and abhorrence of the black nation: the religious communities were
dissolved, the buildings were converted into magazines, or bar racks;
the lands, movables, and cattle were confiscated; and our modern
precedents will support the charge, that much wanton or malicious havoc
was exercised against the relics, and even the books of the monasteries.
With the habit and profession of monks, the public and private worship
of images was rigorously proscribed; and it should seem, that a solemn
abjuration of idolatry was exacted from the subjects, or at least from
the clergy, of the Eastern empire. <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a>

The patient East abjured, with reluctance, her sacred images; they were
fondly cherished, and vigorously defended, by the independent zeal of
the Italians. In ecclesiastical rank and jurisdiction, the patriarch
of Constantinople and the pope of Rome were nearly equal. But the Greek
prelate was a domestic slave under the eye of his master, at whose
nod he alternately passed from the convent to the throne, and from
the throne to the convent. A distant and dangerous station, amidst the
Barbarians of the West, excited the spirit and freedom of the Latin
bishops.
</p>
<p>
Their popular election endeared them to the Romans: the public and
private indigence was relieved by their ample revenue; and the weakness
or neglect of the emperors compelled them to consult, both in peace and
war, the temporal safety of the city. In the school of adversity the
priest insensibly imbibed the virtues and the ambition of a prince; the
same character was assumed, the same policy was adopted, by the Italian,
the Greek, or the Syrian, who ascended the chair of St. Peter; and,
after the loss of her legions and provinces, the genius and fortune of
the popes again restored the supremacy of Rome. It is agreed, that in
the eighth century, their dominion was founded on rebellion, and
that the rebellion was produced, and justified, by the heresy of the
Iconoclasts; but the conduct of the second and third Gregory, in this
memorable contest, is variously interpreted by the wishes of their
friends and enemies. The Byzantine writers unanimously declare, that,
after a fruitless admonition, they pronounced the separation of the
East and West, and deprived the sacrilegious tyrant of the revenue
and sovereignty of Italy. Their excommunication is still more clearly
expressed by the Greeks, who beheld the accomplishment of the papal
triumphs; and as they are more strongly attached to their religion
than to their country, they praise, instead of blaming, the zeal and
orthodoxy of these apostolical men. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> The modern champions of
Rome are eager to accept the praise and the precedent: this great and
glorious example of the deposition of royal heretics is celebrated by
the cardinals Baronius and Bellarmine; <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> and if they are asked,
why the same thunders were not hurled against the Neros and Julians of
antiquity, they reply, that the weakness of the primitive church was the
sole cause of her patient loyalty. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> On this occasion the effects of
love and hatred are the same; and the zealous Protestants, who seek
to kindle the indignation, and to alarm the fears, of princes and
magistrates, expatiate on the insolence and treason of the two Gregories
against their lawful sovereign. <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> They are defended only by the

<h2>
    Chapter XLIX: Conquest Of Italy By The Franks.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
Two original epistles, from Gregory the Second to the emperor Leo, are
still extant; <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> and if they cannot be praised as the most perfect
models of eloquence and logic, they exhibit the portrait, or at least
the mask, of the founder of the papal monarchy. "During ten pure and
fortunate years," says Gregory to the emperor, "we have tasted the
annual comfort of your royal letters, subscribed in purple ink, with
your own hand, the sacred pledges of your attachment to the orthodox
creed of our fathers. How deplorable is the change! how tremendous
the scandal! You now accuse the Catholics of idolatry; and, by the
accusation, you betray your own impiety and ignorance. To this ignorance
we are compelled to adapt the grossness of our style and arguments: the
first elements of holy letters are sufficient for your confusion; and
were you to enter a grammar-school, and avow yourself the enemy of our
worship, the simple and pious children would be provoked to cast
their horn-books at your head." After this decent salutation, the pope
attempts the usual distinction between the idols of antiquity and
the Christian images. The former were the fanciful representations of
phantoms or daemons, at a time when the true God had not manifested
his person in any visible likeness. The latter are the genuine forms
of Christ, his mother, and his saints, who had approved, by a crowd
of miracles, the innocence and merit of this relative worship. He must
indeed have trusted to the ignorance of Leo, since he could assert the
perpetual use of images, from the apostolic age, and their venerable
presence in the six synods of the Catholic church. A more specious
argument is drawn from present possession and recent practice the
harmony of the Christian world supersedes the demand of a general
council; and Gregory frankly confesses, than such assemblies can only
be useful under the reign of an orthodox prince. To the impudent and
inhuman Leo, more guilty than a heretic, he recommends peace, silence,
and implicit obedience to his spiritual guides of Constantinople and
Rome. The limits of civil and ecclesiastical powers are defined by the
pontiff. To the former he appropriates the body; to the latter, the
soul: the sword of justice is in the hands of the magistrate: the more
formidable weapon of excommunication is intrusted to the clergy; and in
the exercise of their divine commission a zealous son will not spare his
offending father: the successor of St. Peter may lawfully chastise
the kings of the earth. "You assault us, O tyrant! with a carnal and
military hand: unarmed and naked we can only implore the Christ, the
prince of the heavenly host, that he will send unto you a devil, for the
destruction of your body and the salvation of your soul. You declare,
with foolish arrogance, I will despatch my orders to Rome: I will break
in pieces the image of St. Peter; and Gregory, like his predecessor
Martin, shall be transported in chains, and in exile, to the foot of the
Imperial throne. Would to God that I might be permitted to tread in the
footsteps of the holy Martin! but may the fate of Constans serve as a
warning to the persecutors of the church! After his just condemnation
by the bishops of Sicily, the tyrant was cut off, in the fullness of his
sins, by a domestic servant: the saint is still adored by the nations of
Scythia, among whom he ended his banishment and his life. But it is our
duty to live for the edification and support of the faithful people; nor
are we reduced to risk our safety on the event of a combat. Incapable as
you are of defending your Roman subjects, the maritime situation of the
city may perhaps expose it to your depredation but we can remove to

this unknown Septetus have some reference to the chief of the Saxon
Heptarchy, to Ina king of Wessex, who, in the pontificate of Gregory the
Second, visited Rome for the purpose, not of baptism, but of pilgrimage!

The first assault of Leo against the images of Constantinople had been
witnessed by a crowd of strangers from Italy and the West, who related
with grief and indignation the sacrilege of the emperor. But on the
reception of his proscriptive edict, they trembled for their domestic
deities: the images of Christ and the Virgin, of the angels, martyrs,
and saints, were abolished in all the churches of Italy; and a strong
alternative was proposed to the Roman pontiff, the royal favor as the
price of his compliance, degradation and exile as the penalty of his
disobedience. Neither zeal nor policy allowed him to hesitate; and
the haughty strain in which Gregory addressed the emperor displays his
confidence in the truth of his doctrine or the powers of resistance.
Without depending on prayers or miracles, he boldly armed against the
public enemy, and his pastoral letters admonished the Italians of their
danger and their duty. <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> At this signal, Ravenna, Venice, and
the cities of the Exarchate and Pentapolis, adhered to the cause of
religion; their military force by sea and land consisted, for the
most part, of the natives; and the spirit of patriotism and zeal was
transfused into the mercenary strangers. The Italians swore to live and
die in the defence of the pope and the holy images; the Roman people was
devoted to their father, and even the Lombards were ambitious to share
the merit and advantage of this holy war. The most treasonable act,
but the most obvious revenge, was the destruction of the statues of Leo
himself: the most effectual and pleasing measure of rebellion, was the
withholding the tribute of Italy, and depriving him of a power which he
had recently abused by the imposition of a new capitation. <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> A form
of administration was preserved by the election of magistrates and
governors; and so high was the public indignation, that the Italians
were prepared to create an orthodox emperor, and to conduct him with
a fleet and army to the palace of Constantinople. In that palace, the
Roman bishops, the second and third Gregory, were condemned as the
authors of the revolt, and every attempt was made, either by fraud or
force, to seize their persons, and to strike at their lives. The city
was repeatedly visited or assaulted by captains of the guards, and dukes
and exarchs of high dignity or secret trust; they landed with foreign
troops, they obtained some domestic aid, and the superstition of Naples
may blush that her fathers were attached to the cause of heresy. But
these clandestine or open attacks were repelled by the courage and
vigilance of the Romans; the Greeks were overthrown and massacred, their
leaders suffered an ignominious death, and the popes, however inclined
to mercy, refused to intercede for these guilty victims. At Ravenna,
<a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> the several quarters of the city had long exercised a bloody and
hereditary feud; in religious controversy they found a new aliment of
faction: but the votaries of images were superior in numbers or spirit,
and the exarch, who attempted to stem the torrent, lost his life in
a popular sedition. To punish this flagitious deed, and restore his
dominion in Italy, the emperor sent a fleet and army into the Adriatic
Gulf. After suffering from the winds and waves much loss and delay,
the Greeks made their descent in the neighborhood of Ravenna: they
threatened to depopulate the guilty capital, and to imitate, perhaps to
surpass, the example of Justinian the Second, who had chastised a
former rebellion by the choice and execution of fifty of the principal
inhabitants. The women and clergy, in sackcloth and ashes, lay prostrate
in prayer: the men were in arms for the defence of their country; the
common danger had united the factions, and the event of a battle was
preferred to the slow miseries of a siege. In a hard-fought day, as the
two armies alternately yielded and advanced, a phantom was seen, a voice
was heard, and Ravenna was victorious by the assurance of victory. The
strangers retreated to their ships, but the populous sea-coast poured
forth a multitude of boats; the waters of the Po were so deeply infected
with blood, that during six years the public prejudice abstained
from the fish of the river; and the institution of an annual feast
perpetuated the worship of images, and the abhorrence of the Greek
tyrant. Amidst the triumph of the Catholic arms, the Roman pontiff
convened a synod of ninety-three bishops against the heresy of the
Iconoclasts. With their consent, he pronounced a general excommunication
against all who by word or deed should attack the tradition of the
fathers and the images of the saints: in this sentence the emperor was
tacitly involved, <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> but the vote of a last and hopeless remonstrance
may seem to imply that the anathema was yet suspended over his guilty
head. No sooner had they confirmed their own safety, the worship of
images, and the freedom of Rome and Italy, than the popes appear to
have relaxed of their severity, and to have spared the relics of the
Byzantine dominion. Their moderate councils delayed and prevented
the election of a new emperor, and they exhorted the Italians not to
separate from the body of the Roman monarchy. The exarch was permitted
to reside within the walls of Ravenna, a captive rather than a master;
and till the Imperial coronation of Charlemagne, the government of Rome
and Italy was exercised in the name of the successors of Constantine.

The liberty of Rome, which had been oppressed by the arms and arts of
Augustus, was rescued, after seven hundred and fifty years of servitude,
from the persecution of Leo the Isaurian. By the Caesars, the triumphs
of the consuls had been annihilated: in the decline and fall of the
empire, the god Terminus, the sacred boundary, had insensibly receded
from the ocean, the Rhine, the Danube, and the Euphrates; and Rome was
reduced to her ancient territory from Viterbo to Terracina, and from
Narni to the mouth of the Tyber. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> When the kings were banished,
the republic reposed on the firm basis which had been founded by their
wisdom and virtue. Their perpetual jurisdiction was divided between
two annual magistrates: the senate continued to exercise the powers
of administration and counsel; and the legislative authority was
distributed in the assemblies of the people, by a well-proportioned
scale of property and service. Ignorant of the arts of luxury, the
primitive Romans had improved the science of government and war: the
will of the community was absolute: the rights of individuals were
sacred: one hundred and thirty thousand citizens were armed for defence
or conquest; and a band of robbers and outlaws was moulded into a nation
deserving of freedom and ambitious of glory. <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> When the sovereignty
of the Greek emperors was extinguished, the ruins of Rome presented
the sad image of depopulation and decay: her slavery was a habit, her
liberty an accident; the effect of superstition, and the object of her
own amazement and terror. The last vestige of the substance, or even the
forms, of the constitution, was obliterated from the practice and memory
of the Romans; and they were devoid of knowledge, or virtue, again to
build the fabric of a commonwealth. Their scanty remnant, the offspring
of slaves and strangers, was despicable in the eyes of the victorious
Barbarians. As often as the Franks or Lombards expressed their most
bitter contempt of a foe, they called him a Roman; "and in this name,"
says the bishop Liutprand, "we include whatever is base, whatever is
cowardly, whatever is perfidious, the extremes of avarice and luxury,
and every vice that can prostitute the dignity of human nature." <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a>
<a href="#note-441" name="noteref-441"><small>441</small></a> By the necessity of their situation, the inhabitants of Rome
were cast into the rough model of a republican government: they were
compelled to elect some judges in peace, and some leaders in war: the
nobles assembled to deliberate, and their resolves could not be executed
without the union and consent of the multitude. The style of the Roman
senate and people was revived, <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> but the spirit was fled; and
their new independence was disgraced by the tumultuous conflict of
vicentiousness and oppression. The want of laws could only be supplied
by the influence of religion, and their foreign and domestic counsels
were moderated by the authority of the bishop. His alms, his sermons,
his correspondence with the kings and prelates of the West, his recent
services, their gratitude, and oath, accustomed the Romans to consider
him as the first magistrate or prince of the city. The Christian
humility of the popes was not offended by the name of Dominus, or Lord;
and their face and inscription are still apparent on the most ancient
coins. <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> Their temporal dominion is now confirmed by the reverence
of a thousand years; and their noblest title is the free choice of a
people, whom they had redeemed from slavery.

In the quarrels of ancient Greece, the holy people of Elis enjoyed a
perpetual peace, under the protection of Jupiter, and in the exercise
of the Olympic games. <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> Happy would it have been for the Romans, if
a similar privilege had guarded the patrimony of St. Peter from the
calamities of war; if the Christians, who visited the holy threshold,
would have sheathed their swords in the presence of the apostle and his
successor. But this mystic circle could have been traced only by the
wand of a legislator and a sage: this pacific system was incompatible
with the zeal and ambition of the popes the Romans were not addicted,
like the inhabitants of Elis, to the innocent and placid labors of
agriculture; and the Barbarians of Italy, though softened by the
climate, were far below the Grecian states in the institutions of
public and private life. A memorable example of repentance and piety was
exhibited by Liutprand, king of the Lombards. In arms, at the gate of
the Vatican, the conqueror listened to the voice of Gregory the Second,
<a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> withdrew his troops, resigned his conquests, respectfully visited
the church of St. Peter, and after performing his devotions, offered
his sword and dagger, his cuirass and mantle, his silver cross, and his
crown of gold, on the tomb of the apostle. But this religious fervor was
the illusion, perhaps the artifice, of the moment; the sense of interest
is strong and lasting; the love of arms and rapine was congenial to the
Lombards; and both the prince and people were irresistibly tempted
by the disorders of Italy, the nakedness of Rome, and the unwarlike
profession of her new chief. On the first edicts of the emperor, they
declared themselves the champions of the holy images: Liutprand invaded
the province of Romagna, which had already assumed that distinctive
appellation; the Catholics of the Exarchate yielded without reluctance
to his civil and military power; and a foreign enemy was introduced for
the first time into the impregnable fortress of Ravenna. That city and
fortress were speedily recovered by the active diligence and maritime
forces of the Venetians; and those faithful subjects obeyed the
exhortation of Gregory himself, in separating the personal guilt of Leo
from the general cause of the Roman empire. <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> The Greeks were
less mindful of the service, than the Lombards of the injury: the two
nations, hostile in their faith, were reconciled in a dangerous and
unnatural alliance: the king and the exarch marched to the conquest of
Spoleto and Rome: the storm evaporated without effect, but the policy
of Liutprand alarmed Italy with a vexatious alternative of hostility and
truce. His successor Astolphus declared himself the equal enemy of the
emperor and the pope: Ravenna was subdued by force or treachery, <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a>
and this final conquest extinguished the series of the exarchs, who had
reigned with a subordinate power since the time of Justinian and
the ruin of the Gothic kingdom. Rome was summoned to acknowledge the
victorious Lombard as her lawful sovereign; the annual tribute of a
piece of gold was fixed as the ransom of each citizen, and the sword of
destruction was unsheathed to exact the penalty of her disobedience. The
Romans hesitated; they entreated; they complained; and the threatening
Barbarians were checked by arms and negotiations, till the popes had
engaged the friendship of an ally and avenger beyond the Alps. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a>

</p>
<p>
In his distress, the first <a href="#note-511" name="noteref-511"><small>511</small></a> Gregory had implored the aid of the
hero of the age, of Charles Martel, who governed the French monarchy
with the humble title of mayor or duke; and who, by his signal victory
over the Saracens, had saved his country, and perhaps Europe, from the
Mahometan yoke. The ambassadors of the pope were received by Charles
with decent reverence; but the greatness of his occupations, and the
shortness of his life, prevented his interference in the affairs of
Italy, except by a friendly and ineffectual mediation. His son Pepin,
the heir of his power and virtues, assumed the office of champion of
the Roman church; and the zeal of the French prince appears to have been
prompted by the love of glory and religion. But the danger was on the
banks of the Tyber, the succor on those of the Seine, and our sympathy
is cold to the relation of distant misery. Amidst the tears of the city,
Stephen the Third embraced the generous resolution of visiting in person
the courts of Lombardy and France, to deprecate the injustice of his
enemy, or to excite the pity and indignation of his friend. After
soothing the public despair by litanies and orations, he undertook this
laborious journey with the ambassadors of the French monarch and the
Greek emperor. The king of the Lombards was inexorable; but his threats
could not silence the complaints, nor retard the speed of the Roman
pontiff, who traversed the Pennine Alps, reposed in the abbey of St.
Maurice, and hastened to grasp the right hand of his protector; a hand
which was never lifted in vain, either in war or friendship. Stephen
was entertained as the visible successor of the apostle; at the next
assembly, the field of March or of May, his injuries were exposed to a
devout and warlike nation, and he repassed the Alps, not as a suppliant,
but as a conqueror, at the head of a French army, which was led by
the king in person. The Lombards, after a weak resistance, obtained an
ignominious peace, and swore to restore the possessions, and to respect
the sanctity, of the Roman church. But no sooner was Astolphus delivered
from the presence of the French arms, than he forgot his promise and
resented his disgrace. Rome was again encompassed by his arms; and
Stephen, apprehensive of fatiguing the zeal of his Transalpine allies
enforced his complaint and request by an eloquent letter in the name and
person of St. Peter himself. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> The apostle assures his adopted sons,
the king, the clergy, and the nobles of France, that, dead in the flesh,
he is still alive in the spirit; that they now hear, and must obey, the
voice of the founder and guardian of the Roman church; that the Virgin,
the angels, the saints, and the martyrs, and all the host of heaven,
unanimously urge the request, and will confess the obligation; that
riches, victory, and paradise, will crown their pious enterprise, and
that eternal damnation will be the penalty of their neglect, if they
suffer his tomb, his temple, and his people, to fall into the hands of
the perfidious Lombards. The second expedition of Pepin was not less
rapid and fortunate than the first: St. Peter was satisfied, Rome
was again saved, and Astolphus was taught the lessons of justice
and sincerity by the scourge of a foreign master. After this double
chastisement, the Lombards languished about twenty years in a state
of languor and decay. But their minds were not yet humbled to their
condition; and instead of affecting the pacific virtues of the feeble,
they peevishly harassed the Romans with a repetition of claims,
evasions, and inroads, which they undertook without reflection, and
terminated without glory. On either side, their expiring monarchy was
pressed by the zeal and prudence of Pope Adrian the First, the genius,
the fortune, and greatness of Charlemagne, the son of Pepin; these
heroes of the church and state were united in public and domestic
friendship, and while they trampled on the prostrate, they varnished
their proceedings with the fairest colors of equity and moderation. <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a>
The passes of the Alps, and the walls of Pavia, were the only defence
of the Lombards; the former were surprised, the latter were invested, by
the son of Pepin; and after a blockade of two years, <a href="#note-531" name="noteref-531"><small>531</small></a> Desiderius,
the last of their native princes, surrendered his sceptre and his
capital.
</p>
<p>
Under the dominion of a foreign king, but in the possession of their
national laws, the Lombards became the brethren, rather than the
subjects, of the Franks; who derived their blood, and manners, and
language, from the same Germanic origin. <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XLIX: Conquest Of Italy By The Franks.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
The mutual obligations of the popes and the Carlovingian family form
the important link of ancient and modern, of civil and ecclesiastical,
history. In the conquest of Italy, the champions of the Roman church
obtained a favorable occasion, a specious title, the wishes of the
people, the prayers and intrigues of the clergy. But the most essential
gifts of the popes to the Carlovingian race were the dignities of
king of France, <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> and of patrician of Rome. I. Under the sacerdotal
monarchy of St. Peter, the nations began to resume the practice of
seeking, on the banks of the Tyber, their kings, their laws, and the
oracles of their fate. The Franks were perplexed between the name and
substance of their government. All the powers of royalty were exercised
by Pepin, mayor of the palace; and nothing, except the regal title,
was wanting to his ambition. His enemies were crushed by his valor;
his friends were multiplied by his liberality; his father had been the
savior of Christendom; and the claims of personal merit were repeated
and ennobled in a descent of four generations. The name and image of
royalty was still preserved in the last descendant of Clovis, the feeble
Childeric; but his obsolete right could only be used as an instrument
of sedition: the nation was desirous of restoring the simplicity of
the constitution; and Pepin, a subject and a prince, was ambitious to
ascertain his own rank and the fortune of his family. The mayor and the
nobles were bound, by an oath of fidelity, to the royal phantom: the
blood of Clovis was pure and sacred in their eyes; and their common
ambassadors addressed the Roman pontiff, to dispel their scruples, or
to absolve their promise. The interest of Pope Zachary, the successor of
the two Gregories, prompted him to decide, and to decide in their favor:
he pronounced that the nation might lawfully unite in the same person
the title and authority of king; and that the unfortunate Childeric, a
victim of the public safety, should be degraded, shaved, and confined
in a monastery for the remainder of his days. An answer so agreeable to
their wishes was accepted by the Franks as the opinion of a casuist, the
sentence of a judge, or the oracle of a prophet: the Merovingian race
disappeared from the earth; and Pepin was exalted on a buckler by the
suffrage of a free people, accustomed to obey his laws and to march
under his standard. His coronation was twice performed, with the
sanction of the popes, by their most faithful servant St. Boniface, the
apostle of Germany, and by the grateful hands of Stephen the Third,
who, in the monastery of St. Denys placed the diadem on the head of his
benefactor. The royal unction of the kings of Israel was dexterously
applied: <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> the successor of St. Peter assumed the character of a
divine ambassador: a German chieftain was transformed into the Lord's
anointed; and this Jewish rite has been diffused and maintained by the
superstition and vanity of modern Europe. The Franks were absolved from
their ancient oath; but a dire anathema was thundered against them
and their posterity, if they should dare to renew the same freedom of
choice, or to elect a king, except in the holy and meritorious race of
the Carlovingian princes. Without apprehending the future danger, these
princes gloried in their present security: the secretary of Charlemagne
affirms, that the French sceptre was transferred by the authority of
the popes; <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> and in their boldest enterprises, they insist, with
confidence, on this signal and successful act of temporal jurisdiction.

II. In the change of manners and language the patricians of Rome
<a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> were far removed from the senate of Romulus, on the palace of
Constantine, from the free nobles of the republic, or the fictitious
parents of the emperor. After the recovery of Italy and Africa by the
arms of Justinian, the importance and danger of those remote provinces
required the presence of a supreme magistrate; he was indifferently
styled the exarch or the patrician; and these governors of Ravenna,
who fill their place in the chronology of princes, extended their
jurisdiction over the Roman city. Since the revolt of Italy and the loss
of the Exarchate, the distress of the Romans had exacted some sacrifice
of their independence. Yet, even in this act, they exercised the right
of disposing of themselves; and the decrees of the senate and people
successively invested Charles Martel and his posterity with the honors
of patrician of Rome. The leaders of a powerful nation would have
disdained a servile title and subordinate office; but the reign of the
Greek emperors was suspended; and, in the vacancy of the empire, they
derived a more glorious commission from the pope and the republic. The
Roman ambassadors presented these patricians with the keys of the shrine
of St. Peter, as a pledge and symbol of sovereignty; with a holy banner
which it was their right and duty to unfurl in the defence of the
church and city. <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> In the time of Charles Martel and of Pepin, the
interposition of the Lombard kingdom covered the freedom, while it
threatened the safety, of Rome; and the patriciate represented only the
title, the service, the alliance, of these distant protectors. The power
and policy of Charlemagne annihilated an enemy, and imposed a master.
In his first visit to the capital, he was received with all the honors
which had formerly been paid to the exarch, the representative of the
emperor; and these honors obtained some new decorations from the joy and
gratitude of Pope Adrian the First. <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> No sooner was he informed of
the sudden approach of the monarch, than he despatched the magistrates
and nobles of Rome to meet him, with the banner, about thirty miles from
the city. At the distance of one mile, the Flaminian way was lined with
the schools, or national communities, of Greeks, Lombards, Saxons, &amp;c.:
the Roman youth were under arms; and the children of a more tender age,
with palms and olive branches in their hands, chanted the praises of
their great deliverer. At the aspect of the holy crosses, and ensigns
of the saints, he dismounted from his horse, led the procession of his
nobles to the Vatican, and, as he ascended the stairs, devoutly kissed
each step of the threshold of the apostles. In the portico, Adrian
expected him at the head of his clergy: they embraced, as friends and
equals; but in their march to the altar, the king or patrician assumed
the right hand of the pope. Nor was the Frank content with these vain
and empty demonstrations of respect. In the twenty-six years that
elapsed between the conquest of Lombardy and his Imperial coronation,
Rome, which had been delivered by the sword, was subject, as his own,
to the sceptre of Charlemagne. The people swore allegiance to his person
and family: in his name money was coined, and justice was administered;
and the election of the popes was examined and confirmed by his
authority. Except an original and self-inherent claim of sovereignty,
there was not any prerogative remaining, which the title of emperor
could add to the patrician of Rome. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The gratitude of the Carlovingians was adequate to these obligations,
and their names are consecrated, as the saviors and benefactors of the
Roman church. Her ancient patrimony of farms and houses was transformed
by their bounty into the temporal dominion of cities and provinces; and
the donation of the Exarchate was the first-fruits of the conquests of
Pepin. <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> Astolphus with a sigh relinquished his prey; the keys
and the hostages of the principal cities were delivered to the French
ambassador; and, in his master's name, he presented them before the tomb
of St. Peter. The ample measure of the Exarchate <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> might comprise all
the provinces of Italy which had obeyed the emperor and his vicegerent;
but its strict and proper limits were included in the territories
of Ravenna, Bologna, and Ferrara: its inseparable dependency was the
Pentapolis, which stretched along the Adriatic from Rimini to Ancona,
and advanced into the midland-country as far as the ridges of the
Apennine. In this transaction, the ambition and avarice of the popes
have been severely condemned. Perhaps the humility of a Christian priest
should have rejected an earthly kingdom, which it was not easy for him
to govern without renouncing the virtues of his profession. Perhaps
a faithful subject, or even a generous enemy, would have been less
impatient to divide the spoils of the Barbarian; and if the emperor
had intrusted Stephen to solicit in his name the restitution of the
Exarchate, I will not absolve the pope from the reproach of treachery
and falsehood. But in the rigid interpretation of the laws, every one
may accept, without injury, whatever his benefactor can bestow without
injustice. The Greek emperor had abdicated, or forfeited, his right to
the Exarchate; and the sword of Astolphus was broken by the stronger
sword of the Carlovingian. It was not in the cause of the Iconoclast
that Pepin has exposed his person and army in a double expedition beyond
the Alps: he possessed, and might lawfully alienate, his conquests:
and to the importunities of the Greeks he piously replied that no human
consideration should tempt him to resume the gift which he had conferred
on the Roman Pontiff for the remission of his sins, and the salvation
of his soul. The splendid donation was granted in supreme and absolute
dominion, and the world beheld for the first time a Christian bishop
invested with the prerogatives of a temporal prince; the choice of
magistrates, the exercise of justice, the imposition of taxes, and
the wealth of the palace of Ravenna. In the dissolution of the Lombard
kingdom, the inhabitants of the duchy of Spoleto <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> sought a refuge
from the storm, shaved their heads after the Roman fashion, declared
themselves the servants and subjects of St. Peter, and completed, by
this voluntary surrender, the present circle of the ecclesiastical
state. That mysterious circle was enlarged to an indefinite extent, by
the verbal or written donation of Charlemagne, <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> who, in the first
transports of his victory, despoiled himself and the Greek emperor of
the cities and islands which had formerly been annexed to the Exarchate.
But, in the cooler moments of absence and reflection, he viewed, with
an eye of jealousy and envy, the recent greatness of his ecclesiastical
ally. The execution of his own and his father's promises was
respectfully eluded: the king of the Franks and Lombards asserted the
inalienable rights of the empire; and, in his life and death, Ravenna,
<a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> as well as Rome, was numbered in the list of his metropolitan
cities. The sovereignty of the Exarchate melted away in the hands of the
popes; they found in the archbishops of Ravenna a dangerous and domestic
rival: <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> the nobles and people disdained the yoke of a priest; and
in the disorders of the times, they could only retain the memory of an
ancient claim, which, in a more prosperous age, they have revived and
realized.

Fraud is the resource of weakness and cunning; and the strong, though
ignorant, Barbarian was often entangled in the net of sacerdotal
policy. The Vatican and Lateran were an arsenal and manufacture,
which, according to the occasion, have produced or concealed a various
collection of false or genuine, of corrupt or suspicious, acts, as they
tended to promote the interest of the Roman church. Before the end
of the eighth century, some apostolic scribe, perhaps the notorious
Isidore, composed the decretals, and the donation of Constantine, the
two magic pillars of the spiritual and temporal monarchy of the popes.
This memorable donation was introduced to the world by an epistle of
Adrian the First, who exhorts Charlemagne to imitate the liberality, and
revive the name, of the great Constantine. <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> According to the legend,
the first of the Christian emperors was healed of the leprosy, and
purified in the waters of baptism, by St. Silvester, the Roman bishop;
and never was physician more gloriously recompensed. His royal proselyte
withdrew from the seat and patrimony of St. Peter; declared his
resolution of founding a new capital in the East; and resigned to
the popes the free and perpetual sovereignty of Rome, Italy, and the
provinces of the West. <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> This fiction was productive of the most
beneficial effects. The Greek princes were convicted of the guilt
of usurpation; and the revolt of Gregory was the claim of his lawful
inheritance. The popes were delivered from their debt of gratitude; and
the nominal gifts of the Carlovingians were no more than the just and
irrevocable restitution of a scanty portion of the ecclesiastical state.
The sovereignty of Rome no longer depended on the choice of a fickle
people; and the successors of St. Peter and Constantine were invested
with the purple and prerogatives of the Caesars. So deep was the
ignorance and credulity of the times, that the most absurd of fables was
received, with equal reverence, in Greece and in France, and is still
enrolled among the decrees of the canon law. <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> The emperors, and the
Romans, were incapable of discerning a forgery, that subverted their
rights and freedom; and the only opposition proceeded from a Sabine
monastery, which, in the beginning of the twelfth century, disputed the
truth and validity of the donation of Constantine. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> In the revival
of letters and liberty, this fictitious deed was transpierced by the pen
of Laurentius Valla, the pen of an eloquent critic and a Roman patriot.
<a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> His contemporaries of the fifteenth century were astonished at his
sacrilegious boldness; yet such is the silent and irresistible progress
of reason, that, before the end of the next age, the fable was rejected
by the contempt of historians <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> and poets, <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> and the tacit or
modest censure of the advocates of the Roman church. <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> The popes
themselves have indulged a smile at the credulity of the vulgar; <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a>
but a false and obsolete title still sanctifies their reign; and, by the
same fortune which has attended the decretals and the Sibylline oracles,
the edifice has subsisted after the foundations have been undermined.

While the popes established in Italy their freedom and dominion, the
images, the first cause of their revolt, were restored in the Eastern
empire. <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> Under the reign of Constantine the Fifth, the union
of civil and ecclesiastical power had overthrown the tree, without
extirpating the root, of superstition. The idols (for such they were
now held) were secretly cherished by the order and the sex most prone
to devotion; and the fond alliance of the monks and females obtained
a final victory over the reason and authority of man. Leo the Fourth
maintained with less rigor the religion of his father and grandfather;
but his wife, the fair and ambitious Irene, had imbibed the zeal of the
Athenians, the heirs of the Idolatry, rather than the philosophy, of
their ancestors. During the life of her husband, these sentiments
were inflamed by danger and dissimulation, and she could only labor
to protect and promote some favorite monks whom she drew from their
caverns, and seated on the metropolitan thrones of the East. But as soon
as she reigned in her own name and that of her son, Irene more seriously
undertook the ruin of the Iconoclasts; and the first step of her future
persecution was a general edict for liberty of conscience.
</p>
<p>
In the restoration of the monks, a thousand images were exposed to the
public veneration; a thousand legends were inverted of their sufferings
and miracles. By the opportunities of death or removal, the episcopal
seats were judiciously filled the most eager competitors for earthly
or celestial favor anticipated and flattered the judgment of their
sovereign; and the promotion of her secretary Tarasius gave Irene the
patriarch of Constantinople, and the command of the Oriental church.
But the decrees of a general council could only be repealed by a
similar assembly: <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> the Iconoclasts whom she convened were bold in
possession, and averse to debate; and the feeble voice of the bishops
was reechoed by the more formidable clamor of the soldiers and people of
Constantinople. The delay and intrigues of a year, the separation of the
disaffected troops, and the choice of Nice for a second orthodox synod,
removed these obstacles; and the episcopal conscience was again, after
the Greek fashion, in the hands of the prince. No more than eighteen
days were allowed for the consummation of this important work: the
Iconoclasts appeared, not as judges, but as criminals or penitents:
the scene was decorated by the legates of Pope Adrian and the Eastern
patriarchs, <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> the decrees were framed by the president Taracius,
and ratified by the acclamations and subscriptions of three hundred and
fifty bishops. They unanimously pronounced, that the worship of images
is agreeable to Scripture and reason, to the fathers and councils of the
church: but they hesitate whether that worship be relative or direct;
whether the Godhead, and the figure of Christ, be entitled to the same
mode of adoration. Of this second Nicene council the acts are still
extant; a curious monument of superstition and ignorance, of falsehood
and folly. I shall only notice the judgment of the bishops on the
comparative merit of image-worship and morality. A monk had concluded a
truce with the daemon of fornication, on condition of interrupting his
daily prayers to a picture that hung in his cell. His scruples prompted
him to consult the abbot. "Rather than abstain from adoring Christ and
his Mother in their holy images, it would be better for you," replied
the casuist, "to enter every brothel, and visit every prostitute, in the
city." <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> For the honor of orthodoxy, at least the orthodoxy of the
Roman church, it is somewhat unfortunate, that the two princes who
convened the two councils of Nice are both stained with the blood of
their sons. The second of these assemblies was approved and rigorously
executed by the despotism of Irene, and she refused her adversaries the
toleration which at first she had granted to her friends. During the
five succeeding reigns, a period of thirty-eight years, the contest
was maintained, with unabated rage and various success, between the
worshippers and the breakers of the images; but I am not inclined
to pursue with minute diligence the repetition of the same events.
Nicephorus allowed a general liberty of speech and practice; and the
only virtue of his reign is accused by the monks as the cause of his
temporal and eternal perdition. Superstition and weakness formed the
character of Michael the First, but the saints and images were incapable
of supporting their votary on the throne. In the purple, Leo the Fifth
asserted the name and religion of an Armenian; and the idols, with their
seditious adherents, were condemned to a second exile. Their applause
would have sanctified the murder of an impious tyrant, but his assassin
and successor, the second Michael, was tainted from his birth with
the Phrygian heresies: he attempted to mediate between the contending
parties; and the intractable spirit of the Catholics insensibly cast him
into the opposite scale. His moderation was guarded by timidity; but his
son Theophilus, alike ignorant of fear and pity, was the last and most
cruel of the Iconoclasts. The enthusiasm of the times ran strongly
against them; and the emperors who stemmed the torrent were exasperated
and punished by the public hatred. After the death of Theophilus, the
final victory of the images was achieved by a second female, his widow
Theodora, whom he left the guardian of the empire. Her measures were
bold and decisive. The fiction of a tardy repentance absolved the fame
and the soul of her deceased husband; the sentence of the Iconoclast
patriarch was commuted from the loss of his eyes to a whipping of
two hundred lashes: the bishops trembled, the monks shouted, and the
festival of orthodoxy preserves the annual memory of the triumph of the
images. A single question yet remained, whether they are endowed with
any proper and inherent sanctity; it was agitated by the Greeks of
the eleventh century; <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> and as this opinion has the strongest
recommendation of absurdity, I am surprised that it was not more
explicitly decided in the affirmative. In the West, Pope Adrian the
First accepted and announced the decrees of the Nicene assembly, which
is now revered by the Catholics as the seventh in rank of the general
councils. Rome and Italy were docile to the voice of their father; but
the greatest part of the Latin Christians were far behind in the race
of superstition. The churches of France, Germany, England, and Spain,
steered a middle course between the adoration and the destruction
of images, which they admitted into their temples, not as objects of
worship, but as lively and useful memorials of faith and history. An
angry book of controversy was composed and published in the name of
Charlemagne: <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a> under his authority a synod of three hundred
bishops was assembled at Frankfort: <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> they blamed the fury of the
Iconoclasts, but they pronounced a more severe censure against the
superstition of the Greeks, and the decrees of their pretended council,
which was long despised by the Barbarians of the West. <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> Among them
the worship of images advanced with a silent and insensible progress;
but a large atonement is made for their hesitation and delay, by the
gross idolatry of the ages which precede the reformation, and of the
countries, both in Europe and America, which are still immersed in the
gloom of superstition.

<h2>
    Chapter XLIX: Conquest Of Italy By The Franks.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
It was after the Nycene synod, and under the reign of the pious Irene,
that the popes consummated the separation of Rome and Italy, by the
translation of the empire to the less orthodox Charlemagne. They were
compelled to choose between the rival nations: religion was not the sole
motive of their choice; and while they dissembled the failings of
their friends, they beheld, with reluctance and suspicion, the Catholic
virtues of their foes. The difference of language and manners had
perpetuated the enmity of the two capitals; and they were alienated from
each other by the hostile opposition of seventy years. In that schism
the Romans had tasted of freedom, and the popes of sovereignty: their
submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a jealous tyrant;
and the revolution of Italy had betrayed the impotence, as well as the
tyranny, of the Byzantine court. The Greek emperors had restored the
images, but they had not restored the Calabrian estates <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> and the
Illyrian diocese, <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> which the Iconociasts had torn away from the
successors of St. Peter; and Pope Adrian threatens them with a sentence
of excommunication unless they speedily abjure this practical heresy.
<a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a> The Greeks were now orthodox; but their religion might be tainted
by the breath of the reigning monarch: the Franks were now contumacious;
but a discerning eye might discern their approaching conversion, from
the use, to the adoration, of images. The name of Charlemagne was
stained by the polemic acrimony of his scribes; but the conqueror
himself conformed, with the temper of a statesman, to the various
practice of France and Italy. In his four pilgrimages or visits to the
Vatican, he embraced the popes in the communion of friendship and
piety; knelt before the tomb, and consequently before the image, of the
apostle; and joined, without scruple, in all the prayers and processions
of the Roman liturgy. Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to
renounce their benefactor? Had they a right to alienate his gift of the
Exarchate? Had they power to abolish his government of Rome? The title
of patrician was below the merit and greatness of Charlemagne; and
it was only by reviving the Western empire that they could pay their
obligations or secure their establishment. By this decisive measure they
would finally eradicate the claims of the Greeks; from the debasement
of a provincial town, the majesty of Rome would be restored: the Latin
Christians would be united, under a supreme head, in their ancient
metropolis; and the conquerors of the West would receive their crown
from the successors of St. Peter. The Roman church would acquire
a zealous and respectable advocate; and, under the shadow of the
Carlovingian power, the bishop might exercise, with honor and safety,
the government of the city. <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a>

</p>
<p>
Before the ruin of Paganism in Rome, the competition for a wealthy
bishopric had often been productive of tumult and bloodshed. The people
was less numerous, but the times were more savage, the prize more
important, and the chair of St. Peter was fiercely disputed by the
leading ecclesiastics who aspired to the rank of sovereign. The reign of
Adrian the First <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> surpasses the measure of past or succeeding ages;
<a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a> the walls of Rome, the sacred patrimony, the ruin of the Lombards,
and the friendship of Charlemagne, were the trophies of his fame: he
secretly edified the throne of his successors, and displayed in a narrow
space the virtues of a great prince. His memory was revered; but in the
next election, a priest of the Lateran, Leo the Third, was preferred to
the nephew and the favorite of Adrian, whom he had promoted to the first
dignities of the church. Their acquiescence or repentance disguised,
above four years, the blackest intention of revenge, till the day of a
procession, when a furious band of conspirators dispersed the unarmed
multitude, and assaulted with blows and wounds the sacred person of
the pope. But their enterprise on his life or liberty was disappointed,
perhaps by their own confusion and remorse. Leo was left for dead on the
ground: on his revival from the swoon, the effect of his loss of blood,
he recovered his speech and sight; and this natural event was improved
to the miraculous restoration of his eyes and tongue, of which he had
been deprived, twice deprived, by the knife of the assassins. <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a> From
his prison he escaped to the Vatican: the duke of Spoleto hastened to
his rescue, Charlemagne sympathized in his injury, and in his camp of
Paderborn in Westphalia accepted, or solicited, a visit from the Roman
pontiff. Leo repassed the Alps with a commission of counts and bishops,
the guards of his safety and the judges of his innocence; and it was not
without reluctance, that the conqueror of the Saxons delayed till the
ensuing year the personal discharge of this pious office. In his fourth
and last pilgrimage, he was received at Rome with the due honors of king
and patrician: Leo was permitted to purge himself by oath of the crimes
imputed to his charge: his enemies were silenced, and the sacrilegious
attempt against his life was punished by the mild and insufficient
penalty of exile. On the festival of Christmas, the last year of the
eighth century, Charlemagne appeared in the church of St. Peter; and,
to gratify the vanity of Rome, he had exchanged the simple dress of his
country for the habit of a patrician. <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> After the celebration of the
holy mysteries, Leo suddenly placed a precious crown on his head, <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a>
and the dome resounded with the acclamations of the people, "Long life
and victory to Charles, the most pious Augustus, crowned by God
the great and pacific emperor of the Romans!" The head and body of
Charlemagne were consecrated by the royal unction: after the example
of the Caesars, he was saluted or adored by the pontiff: his coronation
oath represents a promise to maintain the faith and privileges of the
church; and the first-fruits were paid in his rich offerings to the
shrine of his apostle. In his familiar conversation, the emperor
protested the ignorance of the intentions of Leo, which he would have
disappointed by his absence on that memorable day. But the preparations
of the ceremony must have disclosed the secret; and the journey of
Charlemagne reveals his knowledge and expectation: he had acknowledged
that the Imperial title was the object of his ambition, and a Roman
synod had pronounced, that it was the only adequate reward of his merit
and services. <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The appellation of great has been often bestowed, and sometimes
deserved; but Charlemagne is the only prince in whose favor the title
has been indissolubly blended with the name. That name, with the
addition of saint, is inserted in the Roman calendar; and the saint,
by a rare felicity, is crowned with the praises of the historians and
philosophers of an enlightened age. <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> His real merit is doubtless
enhanced by the barbarism of the nation and the times from which he
emerged: but the apparent magnitude of an object is likewise enlarged by
an unequal comparison; and the ruins of Palmyra derive a casual splendor
from the nakedness of the surrounding desert. Without injustice to his
fame, I may discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of the
restorer of the Western empire. Of his moral virtues, chastity is
not the most conspicuous: <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> but the public happiness could not
be materially injured by his nine wives or concubines, the various
indulgence of meaner or more transient amours, the multitude of his
bastards whom he bestowed on the church, and the long celibacy and
licentious manners of his daughters, <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> whom the father was suspected
of loving with too fond a passion. <a href="#note-971" name="noteref-971"><small>971</small></a> I shall be scarcely
permitted to accuse the ambition of a conqueror; but in a day of equal
retribution, the sons of his brother Carloman, the Merovingian princes
of Aquitain, and the four thousand five hundred Saxons who were beheaded
on the same spot, would have something to allege against the justice and
humanity of Charlemagne. His treatment of the vanquished Saxons <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a>
was an abuse of the right of conquest; his laws were not less sanguinary
than his arms, and in the discussion of his motives, whatever is
subtracted from bigotry must be imputed to temper. The sedentary reader
is amazed by his incessant activity of mind and body; and his subjects
and enemies were not less astonished at his sudden presence, at the
moment when they believed him at the most distant extremity of the
empire; neither peace nor war, nor summer nor winter, were a season of
repose; and our fancy cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign
with the geography of his expeditions. <a href="#note-981" name="noteref-981"><small>981</small></a> But this activity was a
national, rather than a personal, virtue; the vagrant life of a Frank
was spent in the chase, in pilgrimage, in military adventures; and the
journeys of Charlemagne were distinguished only by a more numerous train
and a more important purpose. His military renown must be tried by
the scrutiny of his troops, his enemies, and his actions. Alexander
conquered with the arms of Philip, but the two heroes who preceded
Charlemagne bequeathed him their name, their examples, and the
companions of their victories. At the head of his veteran and superior
armies, he oppressed the savage or degenerate nations, who were
incapable of confederating for their common safety: nor did he ever
encounter an equal antagonist in numbers, in discipline, or in arms The
science of war has been lost and revived with the arts of peace; but
his campaigns are not illustrated by any siege or battle of singular
difficulty and success; and he might behold, with envy, the Saracen
trophies of his grandfather. After the Spanish expedition, his
rear-guard was defeated in the Pyrenaean mountains; and the soldiers,
whose situation was irretrievable, and whose valor was useless, might
accuse, with their last breath, the want of skill or caution of their
general. <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> I touch with reverence the laws of Charlemagne, so highly
applauded by a respectable judge. They compose not a system, but a
series, of occasional and minute edicts, for the correction of abuses,
the reformation of manners, the economy of his farms, the care of his
poultry, and even the sale of his eggs. He wished to improve the laws
and the character of the Franks; and his attempts, however feeble and
imperfect, are deserving of praise: the inveterate evils of the
times were suspended or mollified by his government; <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> but in his
institutions I can seldom discover the general views and the immortal
spirit of a legislator, who survives himself for the benefit of
posterity. The union and stability of his empire depended on the life
of a single man: he imitated the dangerous practice of dividing his
kingdoms among his sons; and after his numerous diets, the whole
constitution was left to fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and
despotism. His esteem for the piety and knowledge of the clergy tempted
him to intrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion and civil
jurisdiction; and his son Lewis, when he was stripped and degraded
by the bishops, might accuse, in some measure, the imprudence of his
father. His laws enforced the imposition of tithes, because the daemons
had proclaimed in the air that the default of payment had been the
cause of the last scarcity. <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> The literary merits of Charlemagne
are attested by the foundation of schools, the introduction of arts, the
works which were published in his name, and his familiar connection with
the subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to educate
both the prince and people. His own studies were tardy, laborious,
and imperfect; if he spoke Latin, and understood Greek, he derived the
rudiments of knowledge from conversation, rather than from books;
and, in his mature age, the emperor strove to acquire the practice
of writing, which every peasant now learns in his infancy. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> The
grammar and logic, the music and astronomy, of the times, were only
cultivated as the handmaids of superstition; but the curiosity of

<p>
That empire was not unworthy of its title; <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> and some of the fairest
kingdoms of Europe were the patrimony or conquest of a prince, who
reigned at the same time in France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Hungary.
<a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> I. The Roman province of Gaul had been transformed into the name
and monarchy of France; but, in the decay of the Merovingian line, its
limits were contracted by the independence of the Britons and the revolt
of Aquitain. Charlemagne pursued, and confined, the Britons on the
shores of the ocean; and that ferocious tribe, whose origin and language
are so different from the French, was chastised by the imposition of
tribute, hostages, and peace. After a long and evasive contest, the
rebellion of the dukes of Aquitain was punished by the forfeiture of
their province, their liberty, and their lives.
</p>
<p>
Harsh and rigorous would have been such treatment of ambitious
governors, who had too faithfully copied the mayors of the palace. But
a recent discovery <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a> has proved that these unhappy princes were the
last and lawful heirs of the blood and sceptre of Clovis, and younger
branch, from the brother of Dagobert, of the Merovingian house. Their
ancient kingdom was reduced to the duchy of Gascogne, to the counties
of Fesenzac and Armagnac, at the foot of the Pyrenees: their race
was propagated till the beginning of the sixteenth century; and after
surviving their Carlovingian tyrants, they were reserved to feel
the injustice, or the favors, of a third dynasty. By the reunion of
Aquitain, France was enlarged to its present boundaries, with the
additions of the Netherlands and Spain, as far as the Rhine. II.
</p>
<p>
The Saracens had been expelled from France by the grandfather and father
of Charlemagne; but they still possessed the greatest part of Spain,
from the rock of Gibraltar to the Pyrenees. Amidst their civil
divisions, an Arabian emir of Saragossa implored his protection in the
diet of Paderborn. Charlemagne undertook the expedition, restored
the emir, and, without distinction of faith, impartially crushed the
resistance of the Christians, and rewarded the obedience and services
of the Mahometans. In his absence he instituted the Spanish march, <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a>
which extended from the Pyrenees to the River Ebro: Barcelona was the
residence of the French governor: he possessed the counties of Rousillon
and Catalonia; and the infant kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon were
subject to his jurisdiction. III. As king of the Lombards, and patrician
of Rome, he reigned over the greatest part of Italy, <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> a tract of
a thousand miles from the Alps to the borders of Calabria. The duchy of
Beneventum, a Lombard fief, had spread, at the expense of the Greeks,
over the modern kingdom of Naples. But Arrechis, the reigning duke,
refused to be included in the slavery of his country; assumed the
independent title of prince; and opposed his sword to the Carlovingian
monarchy. His defence was firm, his submission was not inglorious, and
the emperor was content with an easy tribute, the demolition of his
fortresses, and the acknowledgement, on his coins, of a supreme lord.
The artful flattery of his son Grimoald added the appellation of father,
but he asserted his dignity with prudence, and Benventum insensibly
escaped from the French yoke. <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> IV. Charlemagne was the first who
united Germany under the same sceptre. The name of Oriental France
is preserved in the circle of Franconia; and the people of Hesse and
Thuringia were recently incorporated with the victors, by the conformity
of religion and government. The Alemanni, so formidable to the Romans,
were the faithful vassals and confederates of the Franks; and their
country was inscribed within the modern limits of Alsace, Swabia, and
Switzerland. The Bavarians, with a similar indulgence of their laws and
manners, were less patient of a master: the repeated treasons of Tasillo
justified the abolition of their hereditary dukes; and their power was
shared among the counts, who judged and guarded that important frontier.
But the north of Germany, from the Rhine and beyond the Elbe, was still
hostile and Pagan; nor was it till after a war of thirty-three years
that the Saxons bowed under the yoke of Christ and of Charlemagne.
The idols and their votaries were extirpated: the foundation of eight
bishoprics, of Munster, Osnaburgh, Paderborn, and Minden, of Bremen,
Verden, Hildesheim, and Halberstadt, define, on either side of the
Weser, the bounds of ancient Saxony these episcopal seats were the first
schools and cities of that savage land; and the religion and humanity
of the children atoned, in some degree, for the massacre of the parents.
Beyond the Elbe, the Slavi, or Sclavonians, of similar manners and
various denominations, overspread the modern dominions of Prussia,
Poland, and Bohemia, and some transient marks of obedience have tempted
the French historian to extend the empire to the Baltic and the Vistula.
The conquest or conversion of those countries is of a more recent age;
but the first union of Bohemia with the Germanic body may be justly
ascribed to the arms of Charlemagne. V. He retaliated on the Avars, or
Huns of Pannonia, the same calamities which they had inflicted on the
nations. Their rings, the wooden fortifications which encircled their
districts and villages, were broken down by the triple effort of a
French army, that was poured into their country by land and water,
through the Carpathian mountains and along the plain of the Danube.
After a bloody conflict of eight years, the loss of some French generals
was avenged by the slaughter of the most noble Huns: the relics of the
nation submitted the royal residence of the chagan was left desolate and
unknown; and the treasures, the rapine of two hundred and fifty years,
enriched the victorious troops, or decorated the churches of Italy and
Gaul. <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a> After the reduction of Pannonia, the empire of Charlemagne
was bounded only by the conflux of the Danube with the Teyss and the
Save: the provinces of Istria, Liburnia, and Dalmatia, were an easy,
though unprofitable, accession; and it was an effect of his moderation,
that he left the maritime cities under the real or nominal sovereignty
of the Greeks. But these distant possessions added more to the
reputation than to the power of the Latin emperor; nor did he risk any
ecclesiastical foundations to reclaim the Barbarians from their vagrant
life and idolatrous worship. Some canals of communication between the
rivers, the Saone and the Meuse, the Rhine and the Danube, were faintly
attempted. <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> Their execution would have vivified the empire; and
more cost and labor were often wasted in the structure of a cathedral.

<h2>
    Chapter XLIX: Conquest Of Italy By The Franks.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>
<p>
If we retrace the outlines of this geographical picture, it will be seen
that the empire of the Franks extended, between east and west, from the
Ebro to the Elbe or Vistula; between the north and south, from the duchy
of Beneventum to the River Eyder, the perpetual boundary of Germany
and Denmark. The personal and political importance of Charlemagne
was magnified by the distress and division of the rest of Europe. The
islands of Great Britain and Ireland were disputed by a crowd of princes
of Saxon or Scottish origin: and, after the loss of Spain, the Christian
and Gothic kingdom of Alphonso the Chaste was confined to the narrow
range of the Asturian mountains. These petty sovereigns revered the
power or virtue of the Carlovingian monarch, implored the honor and
support of his alliance, and styled him their common parent, the sole
and supreme emperor of the West. <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> He maintained a more equal
intercourse with the caliph Harun al Rashid, <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> whose dominion
stretched from Africa to India, and accepted from his ambassadors a
tent, a water-clock, an elephant, and the keys of the Holy Sepulchre. It
is not easy to conceive the private friendship of a Frank and an Arab,
who were strangers to each other's person, and language, and religion:
but their public correspondence was founded on vanity, and their remote
situation left no room for a competition of interest. Two thirds of the
Western empire of Rome were subject to Charlemagne, and the deficiency
was amply supplied by his command of the inaccessible or invincible
nations of Germany. But in the choice of his enemies, <a href="#note-1141" name="noteref-1141"><small>1141</small></a> we may be
reasonably surprised that he so often preferred the poverty of the north
to the riches of the south. The three-and-thirty campaigns laboriously
consumed in the woods and morasses of Germany would have sufficed to
assert the amplitude of his title by the expulsion of the Greeks from
Italy and the Saracens from Spain. The weakness of the Greeks would have
insured an easy victory; and the holy crusade against the Saracens
would have been prompted by glory and revenge, and loudly justified by
religion and policy. Perhaps, in his expeditions beyond the Rhine and
the Elbe, he aspired to save his monarchy from the fate of the Roman
empire, to disarm the enemies of civilized society, and to eradicate the
seed of future emigrations. But it has been wisely observed, that, in a
light of precaution, all conquest must be ineffectual, unless it could
be universal, since the increasing circle must be involved in a larger
sphere of hostility. <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> The subjugation of Germany withdrew the veil
which had so long concealed the continent or islands of Scandinavia
from the knowledge of Europe, and awakened the torpid courage of their
barbarous natives. The fiercest of the Saxon idolaters escaped from
the Christian tyrant to their brethren of the North; the Ocean and
Mediterranean were covered with their piratical fleets; and Charlemagne
beheld with a sigh the destructive progress of the Normans, who, in less
than seventy years, precipitated the fall of his race and monarchy.

</p>
<p>
Had the pope and the Romans revived the primitive constitution, the
titles of emperor and Augustus were conferred on Charlemagne for
the term of his life; and his successors, on each vacancy, must have
ascended the throne by a formal or tacit election. But the association
of his son Lewis the Pious asserts the independent right of monarchy and
conquest, and the emperor seems on this occasion to have foreseen and
prevented the latent claims of the clergy. The royal youth was commanded
to take the crown from the altar, and with his own hands to place it on
his head, as a gift which he held from God, his father, and the nation.
<a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> The same ceremony was repeated, though with less energy, in
the subsequent associations of Lothaire and Lewis the Second: the
Carlovingian sceptre was transmitted from father to son in a lineal
descent of four generations; and the ambition of the popes was reduced
to the empty honor of crowning and anointing these hereditary princes,
who were already invested with their power and dominions. The
pious Lewis survived his brothers, and embraced the whole empire
of Charlemagne; but the nations and the nobles, his bishops and his
children, quickly discerned that this mighty mass was no longer inspired
by the same soul; and the foundations were undermined to the centre,
while the external surface was yet fair and entire. After a war, or
battle, which consumed one hundred thousand Franks, the empire was
divided by treaty between his three sons, who had violated every filial
and fraternal duty. The kingdoms of Germany and France were forever
separated; the provinces of Gaul, between the Rhone and the Alps, the
Meuse and the Rhine, were assigned, with Italy, to the Imperial dignity
of Lothaire. In the partition of his share, Lorraine and Arles, two
recent and transitory kingdoms, were bestowed on the younger children;
and Lewis the Second, his eldest son, was content with the realm of
Italy, the proper and sufficient patrimony of a Roman emperor. On his
death without any male issue, the vacant throne was disputed by his
uncles and cousins, and the popes most dexterously seized the occasion
of judging the claims and merits of the candidates, and of bestowing on
the most obsequious, or most liberal, the Imperial office of advocate of
the Roman church. The dregs of the Carlovingian race no longer exhibited
any symptoms of virtue or power, and the ridiculous epithets of the
bard, the stammerer, the fat, and the simple, distinguished the tame and
uniform features of a crowd of kings alike deserving of oblivion. By the
failure of the collateral branches, the whole inheritance devolved to
Charles the Fat, the last emperor of his family: his insanity authorized
the desertion of Germany, Italy, and France: he was deposed in a diet,
and solicited his daily bread from the rebels by whose contempt his life
and liberty had been spared. According to the measure of their force,
the governors, the bishops, and the lords, usurped the fragments of
the falling empire; and some preference was shown to the female or
illegitimate blood of Charlemagne. Of the greater part, the title
and possession were alike doubtful, and the merit was adequate to the
contracted scale of their dominions. Those who could appear with an army
at the gates of Rome were crowned emperors in the Vatican; but their
modesty was more frequently satisfied with the appellation of kings of
Italy: and the whole term of seventy-four years may be deemed a vacancy,
from the abdication of Charles the Fat to the establishment of Otho the
First.

Otho <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> was of the noble race of the dukes of Saxony; and if he truly
descended from Witikind, the adversary and proselyte of Charlemagne,
the posterity of a vanquished people was exalted to reign over their
conquerors. His father, Henry the Fowler, was elected, by the suffrage
of the nation, to save and institute the kingdom of Germany. Its limits
<a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a> were enlarged on every side by his son, the first and greatest of
the Othos. A portion of Gaul, to the west of the Rhine, along the banks
of the Meuse and the Moselle, was assigned to the Germans, by whose
blood and language it has been tinged since the time of Caesar and
Tacitus.
</p>
<p>
Between the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Alps, the successors of Otho
acquired a vain supremacy over the broken kingdoms of Burgundy and
Arles. In the North, Christianity was propagated by the sword of Otho,
the conqueror and apostle of the Slavic nations of the Elbe and Oder:
the marches of Brandenburgh and Sleswick were fortified with German
colonies; and the king of Denmark, the dukes of Poland and Bohemia,
confessed themselves his tributary vassals. At the head of a victorious
army, he passed the Alps, subdued the kingdom of Italy, delivered the
pope, and forever fixed the Imperial crown in the name and nation of
Germany. From that memorable aera, two maxims of public jurisprudence
were introduced by force and ratified by time. I. That the prince, who
was elected in the German diet, acquired, from that instant, the subject
kingdoms of Italy and Rome. II. But that he might not legally assume the
titles of emperor and Augustus, till he had received the crown from the
hands of the Roman pontiff. <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a>

<p>
The Imperial dignity of Charlemagne was announced to the East by the
alteration of his style; and instead of saluting his fathers, the Greek
emperors, he presumed to adopt the more equal and familiar appellation
of brother. <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> Perhaps in his connection with Irene he aspired to
the name of husband: his embassy to Constantinople spoke the language of
peace and friendship, and might conceal a treaty of marriage with
that ambitious princess, who had renounced the most sacred duties of a
mother. The nature, the duration, the probable consequences of such a
union between two distant and dissonant empires, it is impossible to
conjecture; but the unanimous silence of the Latins may teach us to
suspect, that the report was invented by the enemies of Irene, to charge
her with the guilt of betraying the church and state to the strangers
of the West. <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a> The French ambassadors were the spectators, and
had nearly been the victims, of the conspiracy of Nicephorus, and the
national hatred. Constantinople was exasperated by the treason and
sacrilege of ancient Rome: a proverb, "That the Franks were good friends
and bad neighbors," was in every one's mouth; but it was dangerous to
provoke a neighbor who might be tempted to reiterate, in the church of
St. Sophia, the ceremony of his Imperial coronation. After a tedious
journey of circuit and delay, the ambassadors of Nicephorus found him
in his camp, on the banks of the River Sala; and Charlemagne affected to
confound their vanity by displaying, in a Franconian village, the pomp,
or at least the pride, of the Byzantine palace. <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> The Greeks were
successively led through four halls of audience: in the first they were
ready to fall prostrate before a splendid personage in a chair of state,
till he informed them that he was only a servant, the constable, or
master of the horse, of the emperor. The same mistake, and the same
answer, were repeated in the apartments of the count palatine, the
steward, and the chamberlain; and their impatience was gradually
heightened, till the doors of the presence-chamber were thrown open,
and they beheld the genuine monarch, on his throne, enriched with
the foreign luxury which he despised, and encircled with the love and
reverence of his victorious chiefs. A treaty of peace and alliance was
concluded between the two empires, and the limits of the East and West
were defined by the right of present possession. But the Greeks <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a>
soon forgot this humiliating equality, or remembered it only to hate the
Barbarians by whom it was extorted. During the short union of virtue
and power, they respectfully saluted the august Charlemagne, with the
acclamations of basileus, and emperor of the Romans. As soon as these
qualities were separated in the person of his pious son, the Byzantine
letters were inscribed, "To the king, or, as he styles himself, the
emperor of the Franks and Lombards." When both power and virtue were
extinct, they despoiled Lewis the Second of his hereditary title, and
with the barbarous appellation of rex or rega, degraded him among the
crowd of Latin princes. His reply <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a> is expressive of his weakness:
he proves, with some learning, that, both in sacred and profane history,
the name of king is synonymous with the Greek word basileus: if, at
Constantinople, it were assumed in a more exclusive and imperial sense,
he claims from his ancestors, and from the popes, a just participation
of the honors of the Roman purple. The same controversy was revived
in the reign of the Othos; and their ambassador describes, in lively
colors, the insolence of the Byzantine court. <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a> The Greeks affected
to despise the poverty and ignorance of the Franks and Saxons; and in
their last decline refused to prostitute to the kings of Germany the
title of Roman emperors.

These emperors, in the election of the popes, continued to exercise the
powers which had been assumed by the Gothic and Grecian princes; and the
importance of this prerogative increased with the temporal estate
and spiritual jurisdiction of the Roman church. In the Christian
aristocracy, the principal members of the clergy still formed a senate
to assist the administration, and to supply the vacancy, of the bishop.
Rome was divided into twenty-eight parishes, and each parish was
governed by a cardinal priest, or presbyter, a title which, however
common or modest in its origin, has aspired to emulate the purple of
kings. Their number was enlarged by the association of the seven deacons
of the most considerable hospitals, the seven palatine judges of the
Lateran, and some dignitaries of the church. This ecclesiastical senate
was directed by the seven cardinal-bishops of the Roman province, who
were less occupied in the suburb dioceses of Ostia, Porto, Velitrae,
Tusculum, Praeneste, Tibur, and the Sabines, than by their weekly
service in the Lateran, and their superior share in the honors and
authority of the apostolic see. On the death of the pope, these bishops
recommended a successor to the suffrage of the college of cardinals,
<a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> and their choice was ratified or rejected by the applause or
clamor of the Roman people. But the election was imperfect; nor could
the pontiff be legally consecrated till the emperor, the advocate of the
church, had graciously signified his approbation and consent. The
royal commissioner examined, on the spot, the form and freedom of
the proceedings; nor was it till after a previous scrutiny into the
qualifications of the candidates, that he accepted an oath of fidelity,
and confirmed the donations which had successively enriched the
patrimony of St. Peter. In the frequent schisms, the rival claims were
submitted to the sentence of the emperor; and in a synod of bishops he
presumed to judge, to condemn, and to punish, the crimes of a guilty
pontiff. Otho the First imposed a treaty on the senate and people, who
engaged to prefer the candidate most acceptable to his majesty: <a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a>
his successors anticipated or prevented their choice: they bestowed
the Roman benefice, like the bishoprics of Cologne or Bamberg, on their
chancellors or preceptors; and whatever might be the merit of a Frank or
Saxon, his name sufficiently attests the interposition of foreign power.
These acts of prerogative were most speciously excused by the vices of a
popular election. The competitor who had been excluded by the cardinals
appealed to the passions or avarice of the multitude; the Vatican and
the Lateran were stained with blood; and the most powerful senators, the
marquises of Tuscany and the counts of Tusculum, held the apostolic see
in a long and disgraceful servitude. The Roman pontiffs, of the ninth
and tenth centuries, were insulted, imprisoned, and murdered, by their
tyrants; and such was their indigence, after the loss and usurpation
of the ecclesiastical patrimonies, that they could neither support
the state of a prince, nor exercise the charity of a priest. <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> The
influence of two sister prostitutes, Marozia and Theodora, was founded
on their wealth and beauty, their political and amorous intrigues: the
most strenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the Roman mitre, and
their reign <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a> may have suggested to the darker ages <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> the fable
<a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a> of a female pope. <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a> The bastard son, the grandson, and the
great-grandson of Marozia, a rare genealogy, were seated in the chair
of St. Peter, and it was at the age of nineteen years that the second of
these became the head of the Latin church. <a href="#note-1321" name="noteref-1321"><small>1321</small></a> His youth and manhood
were of a suitable complexion; and the nations of pilgrims could bear
testimony to the charges that were urged against him in a Roman synod,
and in the presence of Otho the Great. As John XII. had renounced the
dress and decencies of his profession, the soldier may not perhaps be
dishonored by the wine which he drank, the blood that he spilt, the
flames that he kindled, or the licentious pursuits of gaming and
hunting. His open simony might be the consequence of distress; and his
blasphemous invocation of Jupiter and Venus, if it be true, could not
possibly be serious. But we read, with some surprise, that the worthy
grandson of Marozia lived in public adultery with the matrons of Rome;
that the Lateran palace was turned into a school for prostitution, and
that his rapes of virgins and widows had deterred the female pilgrims
from visiting the tomb of St. Peter, lest, in the devout act, they
should be violated by his successor. <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> The Protestants have dwelt
with malicious pleasure on these characters of Antichrist; but to a
philosophic eye, the vices of the clergy are far less dangerous than
their virtues. After a long series of scandal, the apostolic see was
reformed and exalted by the austerity and zeal of Gregory VII. That
ambitious monk devoted his life to the execution of two projects. I.
To fix in the college of cardinals the freedom and independence of
election, and forever to abolish the right or usurpation of the emperors
and the Roman people. II. To bestow and resume the Western empire as
a fief or benefice <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a> of the church, and to extend his temporal
dominion over the kings and kingdoms of the earth. After a contest of
fifty years, the first of these designs was accomplished by the firm
support of the ecclesiastical order, whose liberty was connected with
that of their chief. But the second attempt, though it was crowned with
some partial and apparent success, has been vigorously resisted by the
secular power, and finally extinguished by the improvement of human
reason.

In the revival of the empire of empire of Rome, neither the bishop nor
the people could bestow on Charlemagne or Otho the provinces which were
lost, as they had been won, by the chance of arms. But the Romans were
free to choose a master for themselves; and the powers which had been
delegated to the patrician, were irrevocably granted to the French
and Saxon emperors of the West. The broken records of the times <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a>
preserve some remembrance of their palace, their mint, their tribunal,
their edicts, and the sword of justice, which, as late as the thirteenth
century, was derived from Caesar to the praefect of the city. <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a>
Between the arts of the popes and the violence of the people, this
supremacy was crushed and annihilated. Content with the titles of
emperor and Augustus, the successors of Charlemagne neglected to assert
this local jurisdiction. In the hour of prosperity, their ambition was
diverted by more alluring objects; and in the decay and division of
the empire, they were oppressed by the defence of their hereditary
provinces. Amidst the ruins of Italy, the famous Marozia invited one
of the usurpers to assume the character of her third husband; and Hugh,
king of Burgundy was introduced by her faction into the mole of Hadrian
or Castle of St. Angelo, which commands the principal bridge and
entrance of Rome. Her son by the first marriage, Alberic, was compelled
to attend at the nuptial banquet; but his reluctant and ungraceful
service was chastised with a blow by his new father. The blow was
productive of a revolution. "Romans," exclaimed the youth, "once you
were the masters of the world, and these Burgundians the most abject of
your slaves. They now reign, these voracious and brutal savages, and
my injury is the commencement of your servitude." <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a> The alarum bell
rang to arms in every quarter of the city: the Burgundians retreated
with haste and shame; Marozia was imprisoned by her victorious son, and
his brother, Pope John XI., was reduced to the exercise of his spiritual
functions. With the title of prince, Alberic possessed above twenty
years the government of Rome; and he is said to have gratified the
popular prejudice, by restoring the office, or at least the title,
of consuls and tribunes. His son and heir Octavian assumed, with
the pontificate, the name of John XII.: like his predecessor, he was
provoked by the Lombard princes to seek a deliverer for the church
and republic; and the services of Otho were rewarded with the Imperial
dignity. But the Saxon was imperious, the Romans were impatient, the
festival of the coronation was disturbed by the secret conflict of
prerogative and freedom, and Otho commanded his sword-bearer not to stir
from his person, lest he should be assaulted and murdered at the foot of
the altar. <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a> Before he repassed the Alps, the emperor chastised
the revolt of the people and the ingratitude of John XII. The pope was
degraded in a synod; the praefect was mounted on an ass, whipped through
the city, and cast into a dungeon; thirteen of the most guilty were
hanged, others were mutilated or banished; and this severe process was
justified by the ancient laws of Theodosius and Justinian. The voice
of fame has accused the second Otho of a perfidious and bloody act, the
massacre of the senators, whom he had invited to his table under the
fair semblance of hospitality and friendship. <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a> In the minority of
his son Otho the Third, Rome made a bold attempt to shake off the Saxon
yoke, and the consul Crescentius was the Brutus of the republic. From
the condition of a subject and an exile, he twice rose to the command
of the city, oppressed, expelled, and created the popes, and formed a
conspiracy for restoring the authority of the Greek emperors. <a href="#note-1391" name="noteref-1391"><small>1391</small></a> In
the fortress of St. Angelo, he maintained an obstinate siege, till the
unfortunate consul was betrayed by a promise of safety: his body was
suspended on a gibbet, and his head was exposed on the battlements of
the castle. By a reverse of fortune, Otho, after separating his troops,
was besieged three days, without food, in his palace; and a disgraceful
escape saved him from the justice or fury of the Romans. The senator
Ptolemy was the leader of the people, and the widow of Crescentius
enjoyed the pleasure or the fame of revenging her husband, by a poison
which she administered to her Imperial lover. It was the design of Otho
the Third to abandon the ruder countries of the North, to erect his
throne in Italy, and to revive the institutions of the Roman monarchy.
But his successors only once in their lives appeared on the banks of the
Tyber, to receive their crown in the Vatican. <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a> Their absence was
contemptible, their presence odious and formidable. They descended
from the Alps, at the head of their barbarians, who were strangers and
enemies to the country; and their transient visit was a scene of tumult
and bloodshed. <a href="#note-141" name="noteref-141"><small>141</small></a> A faint remembrance of their ancestors still
tormented the Romans; and they beheld with pious indignation the
succession of Saxons, Franks, Swabians, and Bohemians, who usurped the
purple and prerogatives of the Caesars.

<h2>
    Chapter XLIX: Conquest Of Italy By The Franks.&mdash;Part VI.
</h2>
<p>
There is nothing perhaps more adverse to nature and reason than to hold
in obedience remote countries and foreign nations, in opposition to
their inclination and interest. A torrent of Barbarians may pass over
the earth, but an extensive empire must be supported by a refined system
of policy and oppression; in the centre, an absolute power, prompt in
action and rich in resources; a swift and easy communication with the
extreme parts; fortifications to check the first effort of rebellion;
a regular administration to protect and punish; and a well-disciplined
army to inspire fear, without provoking discontent and despair. Far
different was the situation of the German Caesars, who were ambitious to
enslave the kingdom of Italy. Their patrimonial estates were stretched
along the Rhine, or scattered in the provinces; but this ample domain
was alienated by the imprudence or distress of successive princes;
and their revenue, from minute and vexatious prerogative, was scarcely
sufficient for the maintenance of their household. Their troops were
formed by the legal or voluntary service of their feudal vassals, who
passed the Alps with reluctance, assumed the license of rapine and
disorder, and capriciously deserted before the end of the campaign.
Whole armies were swept away by the pestilential influence of the
climate: the survivors brought back the bones of their princes and
nobles, <a href="#note-142" name="noteref-142"><small>142</small></a> and the effects of their own intemperance were often
imputed to the treachery and malice of the Italians, who rejoiced at
least in the calamities of the Barbarians. This irregular tyranny might
contend on equal terms with the petty tyrants of Italy; nor can the
people, or the reader, be much interested in the event of the quarrel.
But in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Lombards rekindled the
flame of industry and freedom; and the generous example was at length
imitated by the republics of Tuscany. <a href="#note-1421" name="noteref-1421"><small>1421</small></a> In the Italian cities a
municipal government had never been totally abolished; and their first
privileges were granted by the favor and policy of the emperors, who
were desirous of erecting a plebeian barrier against the independence of
the nobles. But their rapid progress, the daily extension of their power
and pretensions, were founded on the numbers and spirit of these rising
communities. <a href="#note-143" name="noteref-143"><small>143</small></a> Each city filled the measure of her diocese or
district: the jurisdiction of the counts and bishops, of the marquises
and counts, was banished from the land; and the proudest nobles were
persuaded or compelled to desert their solitary castles, and to embrace
the more honorable character of freemen and magistrates. The legislative
authority was inherent in the general assembly; but the executive powers
were intrusted to three consuls, annually chosen from the three orders
of captains, valvassors, <a href="#note-144" name="noteref-144"><small>144</small></a> and commons, into which the republic was
divided. Under the protection of equal law, the labors of agriculture
and commerce were gradually revived; but the martial spirit of the
Lombards was nourished by the presence of danger; and as often as the
bell was rung, or the standard <a href="#note-145" name="noteref-145"><small>145</small></a> erected, the gates of the city
poured forth a numerous and intrepid band, whose zeal in their own cause
was soon guided by the use and discipline of arms. At the foot of these
popular ramparts, the pride of the Caesars was overthrown; and the
invincible genius of liberty prevailed over the two Frederics, the
greatest princes of the middle age; the first, superior perhaps in
military prowess; the second, who undoubtedly excelled in the softer
accomplishments of peace and learning.

Ambitious of restoring the splendor of the purple, Frederic the First
invaded the republics of Lombardy, with the arts of a statesman, the
valor of a soldier, and the cruelty of a tyrant. The recent discovery of
the Pandects had renewed a science most favorable to despotism; and his
venal advocates proclaimed the emperor the absolute master of the lives
and properties of his subjects. His royal prerogatives, in a less odious
sense, were acknowledged in the diet of Roncaglia; and the revenue of
Italy was fixed at thirty thousand pounds of silver, <a href="#note-146" name="noteref-146"><small>146</small></a> which were
multiplied to an indefinite demand by the rapine of the fiscal officers.
The obstinate cities were reduced by the terror or the force of his
arms: his captives were delivered to the executioner, or shot from
his military engines; and. after the siege and surrender of Milan,
the buildings of that stately capital were razed to the ground, three
hundred hostages were sent into Germany, and the inhabitants were
dispersed in four villages, under the yoke of the inflexible conqueror.
<a href="#note-147" name="noteref-147"><small>147</small></a> But Milan soon rose from her ashes; and the league of Lombardy was
cemented by distress: their cause was espoused by Venice, Pope
Alexander the Third, and the Greek emperor: the fabric of oppression
was overturned in a day; and in the treaty of Constance, Frederic
subscribed, with some reservations, the freedom of four-and-twenty
cities. His grandson contended with their vigor and maturity; but
Frederic the Second <a href="#note-148" name="noteref-148"><small>148</small></a> was endowed with some personal and peculiar
advantages. His birth and education recommended him to the Italians;
and in the implacable discord of the two factions, the Ghibelins were
attached to the emperor, while the Guelfs displayed the banner of
liberty and the church. The court of Rome had slumbered, when his father
Henry the Sixth was permitted to unite with the empire the kingdoms of
Naples and Sicily; and from these hereditary realms the son derived an
ample and ready supply of troops and treasure. Yet Frederic the Second
was finally oppressed by the arms of the Lombards and the thunders of
the Vatican: his kingdom was given to a stranger, and the last of his
family was beheaded at Naples on a public scaffold. During sixty years,
no emperor appeared in Italy, and the name was remembered only by the
ignominious sale of the last relics of sovereignty.

The Barbarian conquerors of the West were pleased to decorate their
chief with the title of emperor; but it was not their design to invest
him with the despotism of Constantine and Justinian. The persons of the
Germans were free, their conquests were their own, and their
national character was animated by a spirit which scorned the servile
jurisprudence of the new or the ancient Rome. It would have been a vain
and dangerous attempt to impose a monarch on the armed freemen, who
were impatient of a magistrate; on the bold, who refused to obey; on the
powerful, who aspired to command. The empire of Charlemagne and Otho was
distributed among the dukes of the nations or provinces, the counts of
the smaller districts, and the margraves of the marches or frontiers,
who all united the civil and military authority as it had been delegated
to the lieutenants of the first Caesars. The Roman governors, who,
for the most part, were soldiers of fortune, seduced their mercenary
legions, assumed the Imperial purple, and either failed or succeeded in
their revolt, without wounding the power and unity of government. If the
dukes, margraves, and counts of Germany, were less audacious in
their claims, the consequences of their success were more lasting and
pernicious to the state. Instead of aiming at the supreme rank,
they silently labored to establish and appropriate their provincial
independence. Their ambition was seconded by the weight of their estates
and vassals, their mutual example and support, the common interest
of the subordinate nobility, the change of princes and families, the
minorities of Otho the Third and Henry the Fourth, the ambition of the
popes, and the vain pursuit of the fugitive crowns of Italy and Rome.
All the attributes of regal and territorial jurisdiction were gradually
usurped by the commanders of the provinces; the right of peace and war,
of life and death, of coinage and taxation, of foreign alliance and
domestic economy. Whatever had been seized by violence, was ratified
by favor or distress, was granted as the price of a doubtful vote or a
voluntary service; whatever had been granted to one could not, without
injury, be denied to his successor or equal; and every act of local or
temporary possession was insensibly moulded into the constitution of the
Germanic kingdom. In every province, the visible presence of the duke or
count was interposed between the throne and the nobles; the subjects of
the law became the vassals of a private chief; and the standard which he
received from his sovereign, was often raised against him in the field.
The temporal power of the clergy was cherished and exalted by the
superstition or policy of the Carlovingian and Saxon dynasties, who
blindly depended on their moderation and fidelity; and the bishoprics of
Germany were made equal in extent and privilege, superior in wealth and
population, to the most ample states of the military order. As long
as the emperors retained the prerogative of bestowing on every vacancy
these ecclesiastic and secular benefices, their cause was maintained
by the gratitude or ambition of their friends and favorites. But in the
quarrel of the investitures, they were deprived of their influence over
the episcopal chapters; the freedom of election was restored, and the
sovereign was reduced, by a solemn mockery, to his first prayers, the
recommendation, once in his reign, to a single prebend in each church.
The secular governors, instead of being recalled at the will of a
superior, could be degraded only by the sentence of their peers. In the
first age of the monarchy, the appointment of the son to the duchy
or county of his father, was solicited as a favor; it was gradually
obtained as a custom, and extorted as a right: the lineal succession was
often extended to the collateral or female branches; the states of the
empire (their popular, and at length their legal, appellation) were
divided and alienated by testament and sale; and all idea of a public
trust was lost in that of a private and perpetual inheritance. The
emperor could not even be enriched by the casualties of forfeiture and
extinction: within the term of a year, he was obliged to dispose of the
vacant fief; and, in the choice of the candidate, it was his duty to
consult either the general or the provincial diet.
</p>
<p>
After the death of Frederic the Second, Germany was left a monster with
a hundred heads. A crowd of princes and prelates disputed the ruins of
the empire: the lords of innumerable castles were less prone to obey,
than to imitate, their superiors; and, according to the measure of their
strength, their incessant hostilities received the names of conquest
or robbery. Such anarchy was the inevitable consequence of the laws and
manners of Europe; and the kingdoms of France and Italy were shivered
into fragments by the violence of the same tempest. But the Italian
cities and the French vassals were divided and destroyed, while the
union of the Germans has produced, under the name of an empire, a
great system of a federative republic. In the frequent and at last the
perpetual institution of diets, a national spirit was kept alive, and
the powers of a common legislature are still exercised by the three
branches or colleges of the electors, the princes, and the free and
Imperial cities of Germany. I. Seven of the most powerful feudatories
were permitted to assume, with a distinguished name and rank, the
exclusive privilege of choosing the Roman emperor; and these electors
were the king of Bohemia, the duke of Saxony, the margrave of
Brandenburgh, the count palatine of the Rhine, and the three archbishops
of Mentz, of Treves, and of Cologne. II. The college of princes and
prelates purged themselves of a promiscuous multitude: they reduced to
four representative votes the long series of independent counts, and
excluded the nobles or equestrian order, sixty thousand of whom, as in
the Polish diets, had appeared on horseback in the field of election.
III. The pride of birth and dominion, of the sword and the mitre, wisely
adopted the commons as the third branch of the legislature, and, in the
progress of society, they were introduced about the same aera into the
national assemblies of France England, and Germany.
</p>
<p>
The Hanseatic League commanded the trade and navigation of the north:
the confederates of the Rhine secured the peace and intercourse of the
inland country; the influence of the cities has been adequate to their
wealth and policy, and their negative still invalidates the acts of the
two superior colleges of electors and princes. <a href="#note-149" name="noteref-149"><small>149</small></a>

It is in the fourteenth century that we may view in the strongest light
the state and contrast of the Roman empire of Germany, which no longer
held, except on the borders of the Rhine and Danube, a single province
of Trajan or Constantine. Their unworthy successors were the counts of
Hapsburgh, of Nassau, of Luxemburgh, and Schwartzenburgh: the emperor
Henry the Seventh procured for his son the crown of Bohemia, and
his grandson Charles the Fourth was born among a people strange and
barbarous in the estimation of the Germans themselves. <a href="#note-150" name="noteref-150"><small>150</small></a> After the
excommunication of Lewis of Bavaria, he received the gift or promise
of the vacant empire from the Roman pontiffs, who, in the exile and
captivity of Avignon, affected the dominion of the earth. The death
of his competitors united the electoral college, and Charles was
unanimously saluted king of the Romans, and future emperor; a title
which, in the same age, was prostituted to the Caesars of Germany and
Greece. The German emperor was no more than the elective and impotent
magistrate of an aristocracy of princes, who had not left him a village
that he might call his own. His best prerogative was the right of
presiding and proposing in the national senate, which was convened at
his summons; and his native kingdom of Bohemia, less opulent than the
adjacent city of Nuremberg, was the firmest seat of his power and the
richest source of his revenue. The army with which he passed the Alps
consisted of three hundred horse. In the cathedral of St. Ambrose,
Charles was crowned with the iron crown, which tradition ascribed to the
Lombard monarchy; but he was admitted only with a peaceful train; the
gates of the city were shut upon him; and the king of Italy was held
a captive by the arms of the Visconti, whom he confirmed in the
sovereignty of Milan. In the Vatican he was again crowned with the
golden crown of the empire; but, in obedience to a secret treaty, the
Roman emperor immediately withdrew, without reposing a single night
within the walls of Rome. The eloquent Petrarch, <a href="#note-151" name="noteref-151"><small>151</small></a> whose fancy
revived the visionary glories of the Capitol, deplores and upbraids the
ignominious flight of the Bohemian; and even his contemporaries could
observe, that the sole exercise of his authority was in the lucrative
sale of privileges and titles. The gold of Italy secured the election
of his son; but such was the shameful poverty of the Roman emperor, that
his person was arrested by a butcher in the streets of Worms, and was
detained in the public inn, as a pledge or hostage for the payment of
his expenses.

<p>
From this humiliating scene, let us turn to the apparent majesty of the
same Charles in the diets of the empire. The golden bull, which fixes
the Germanic constitution, is promulgated in the style of a sovereign
and legislator. A hundred princes bowed before his throne, and exalted
their own dignity by the voluntary honors which they yielded to their
chief or minister. At the royal banquet, the hereditary great officers,
the seven electors, who in rank and title were equal to kings, performed
their solemn and domestic service of the palace. The seals of the triple
kingdom were borne in state by the archbishops of Mentz, Cologne, and
Treves, the perpetual arch-chancellors of Germany, Italy, and Arles.
The great marshal, on horseback, exercised his function with a silver
measure of oats, which he emptied on the ground, and immediately
dismounted to regulate the order of the guests The great steward, the
count palatine of the Rhine, place the dishes on the table. The great
chamberlain, the margrave of Brandenburgh, presented, after the repast,
the golden ewer and basin, to wash. The king of Bohemia, as great
cup-bearer, was represented by the emperor's brother, the duke of
Luxemburgh and Brabant; and the procession was closed by the great
huntsmen, who introduced a boar and a stag, with a loud chorus of horns
and hounds. <a href="#note-152" name="noteref-152"><small>152</small></a> Nor was the supremacy of the emperor confined
to Germany alone: the hereditary monarchs of Europe confessed the
preeminence of his rank and dignity: he was the first of the Christian
princes, the temporal head of the great republic of the West: <a href="#note-153" name="noteref-153"><small>153</small></a> to
his person the title of majesty was long appropriated; and he disputed
with the pope the sublime prerogative of creating kings and assembling
councils. The oracle of the civil law, the learned Bartolus, was a
pensioner of Charles the Fourth; and his school resounded with the
doctrine, that the Roman emperor was the rightful sovereign of the
earth, from the rising to the setting sun. The contrary opinion was
condemned, not as an error, but as a heresy, since even the gospel had
pronounced, "And there went forth a decree from Caesar Augustus, that
all the world should be taxed." <a href="#note-154" name="noteref-154"><small>154</small></a>

If we annihilate the interval of time and space between Augustus and
Charles, strong and striking will be the contrast between the two
Caesars; the Bohemian who concealed his weakness under the mask of
ostentation, and the Roman, who disguised his strength under the
semblance of modesty. At the head of his victorious legions, in his
reign over the sea and land, from the Nile and Euphrates to the Atlantic
Ocean, Augustus professed himself the servant of the state and the equal
of his fellow-citizens. The conqueror of Rome and her provinces assumed
a popular and legal form of a censor, a consul, and a tribune. His will
was the law of mankind, but in the declaration of his laws he borrowed
the voice of the senate and people; and from their decrees their
master accepted and renewed his temporary commission to administer the
republic. In his dress, his domestics, <a href="#note-155" name="noteref-155"><small>155</small></a> his titles, in all the
offices of social life, Augustus maintained the character of a private
Roman; and his most artful flatterers respected the secret of his
