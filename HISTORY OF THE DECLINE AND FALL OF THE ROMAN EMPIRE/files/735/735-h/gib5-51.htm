<p>
The revolution of Arabia had not changed the character of the Arabs: the
death of Mahomet was the signal of independence; and the hasty structure
of his power and religion tottered to its foundations. A small and
faithful band of his primitive disciples had listened to his eloquence,
and shared his distress; had fled with the apostle from the persecution
of Mecca, or had received the fugitive in the walls of Medina. The
increasing myriads, who acknowledged Mahomet as their king and prophet,
had been compelled by his arms, or allured by his prosperity. The
polytheists were confounded by the simple idea of a solitary and
invisible God; the pride of the Christians and Jews disdained the
yoke of a mortal and contemporary legislator. The habits of faith and
obedience were not sufficiently confirmed; and many of the new converts
regretted the venerable antiquity of the law of Moses, or the rites
and mysteries of the Catholic church; or the idols, the sacrifices, the
joyous festivals, of their Pagan ancestors. The jarring interests and
hereditary feuds of the Arabian tribes had not yet coalesced in a system
of union and subordination; and the Barbarians were impatient of the
mildest and most salutary laws that curbed their passions, or violated
their customs. They submitted with reluctance to the religious precepts
of the Koran, the abstinence from wine, the fast of the Ramadan, and the
daily repetition of five prayers; and the alms and tithes, which were
collected for the treasury of Medina, could be distinguished only by
a name from the payment of a perpetual and ignominious tribute. The
example of Mahomet had excited a spirit of fanaticism or imposture,
and several of his rivals presumed to imitate the conduct, and defy
the authority, of the living prophet. At the head of the fugitives
and auxiliaries, the first caliph was reduced to the cities of Mecca,
Medina, and Tayef; and perhaps the Koreish would have restored the
idols of the Caaba, if their levity had not been checked by a seasonable
reproof. "Ye men of Mecca, will ye be the last to embrace, and the
first to abandon, the religion of Islam?" After exhorting the Moslems
to confide in the aid of God and his apostle, Abubeker resolved, by a
vigorous attack, to prevent the junction of the rebels. The women
and children were safely lodged in the cavities of the mountains: the
warriors, marching under eleven banners, diffused the terror of their
arms; and the appearance of a military force revived and confirmed the
loyalty of the faithful. The inconstant tribes accepted, with humble
repentance, the duties of prayer, and fasting, and alms; and, after
some examples of success and severity, the most daring apostates fell
prostrate before the sword of the Lord and of Caled. In the fertile
province of Yemanah, <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Persia,
in a city not inferior to Medina itself, a powerful chief (his name
was Moseilama) had assumed the character of a prophet, and the tribe of
Hanifa listened to his voice. A female prophetess <a href="#note-1111" name="noteref-1111"><small>1111</small></a> was attracted
by his reputation; the decencies of words and actions were spurned by
these favorites of Heaven; <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> and they employed several days in mystic
and amorous converse. An obscure sentence of his Koran, or book, is yet
extant; <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> and in the pride of his mission, Moseilama condescended to
offer a partition of the earth. The proposal was answered by Mahomet
with contempt; but the rapid progress of the impostor awakened the
fears of his successor: forty thousand Moslems were assembled under the
standard of Caled; and the existence of their faith was resigned to
the event of a decisive battle. <a href="#note-3111" name="noteref-3111"><small>3111</small></a> In the first action they
were repulsed by the loss of twelve hundred men; but the skill and
perseverance of their general prevailed; their defeat was avenged by the
slaughter of ten thousand infidels; and Moseilama himself was pierced by
an Aethiopian slave with the same javelin which had mortally wounded
the uncle of Mahomet. The various rebels of Arabia without a chief or
a cause, were speedily suppressed by the power and discipline of
the rising monarchy; and the whole nation again professed, and more
steadfastly held, the religion of the Koran. The ambition of the caliphs
provided an immediate exercise for the restless spirit of the Saracens:
their valor was united in the prosecution of a holy war; and their
enthusiasm was equally confirmed by opposition and victory.

volumes, has selected only the grosser part of this singular

<p>
From the rapid conquests of the Saracens a presumption will naturally
arise, that the caliphs <a href="#note-311" name="noteref-311"><small>311</small></a> commanded in person the armies of the
faithful, and sought the crown of martyrdom in the foremost ranks of
the battle. The courage of Abubeker, <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> Omar, <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> and Othman, <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> had
indeed been tried in the persecution and wars of the prophet; and the
personal assurance of paradise must have taught them to despise the
pleasures and dangers of the present world. But they ascended the
throne in a venerable or mature age; and esteemed the domestic cares of
religion and justice the most important duties of a sovereign.
Except the presence of Omar at the siege of Jerusalem, their longest
expeditions were the frequent pilgrimage from Medina to Mecca; and they
calmly received the tidings of victory as they prayed or preached before
the sepulchre of the prophet. The austere and frugal measure of
their lives was the effect of virtue or habit, and the pride of their
simplicity insulted the vain magnificence of the kings of the earth.
When Abubeker assumed the office of caliph, he enjoined his daughter
Ayesha to take a strict account of his private patrimony, that it might
be evident whether he were enriched or impoverished by the service of
the state. He thought himself entitled to a stipend of three pieces
of gold, with the sufficient maintenance of a single camel and a black
slave; but on the Friday of each week he distributed the residue of his
own and the public money, first to the most worthy, and then to the most
indigent, of the Moslems. The remains of his wealth, a coarse garment,
and five pieces of gold, were delivered to his successor, who lamented
with a modest sigh his own inability to equal such an admirable model.
Yet the abstinence and humility of Omar were not inferior to the virtues
of Abubeker: his food consisted of barley bread or dates; his drink was
water; he preached in a gown that was torn or tattered in twelve places;
and the Persian satrap, who paid his homage to the conqueror, found him
asleep among the beggars on the steps of the mosch of Medina. Oeeconomy
is the source of liberality, and the increase of the revenue enabled
Omar to establish a just and perpetual reward for the past and present
services of the faithful. Careless of his own emolument, he assigned to
Abbas, the uncle of the prophet, the first and most ample allowance of
twenty-five thousand drachms or pieces of silver. Five thousand were
allotted to each of the aged warriors, the relics of the field of Beder;
and the last and meanest of the companions of Mahomet was distinguished
by the annual reward of three thousand pieces. One thousand was the
stipend of the veterans who had fought in the first battles against the
Greeks and Persians; and the decreasing pay, as low as fifty pieces
of silver, was adapted to the respective merit and seniority of the
soldiers of Omar. Under his reign, and that of his predecessor, the
conquerors of the East were the trusty servants of God and the people;
the mass of the public treasure was consecrated to the expenses of
peace and war; a prudent mixture of justice and bounty maintained the
discipline of the Saracens, and they united, by a rare felicity, the
despatch and execution of despotism with the equal and frugal maxims of
a republican government. The heroic courage of Ali, <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> the consummate
prudence of Moawiyah, <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> excited the emulation of their subjects; and
the talents which had been exercised in the school of civil discord
were more usefully applied to propagate the faith and dominion of
the prophet. In the sloth and vanity of the palace of Damascus, the
succeeding princes of the house of Ommiyah were alike destitute of the
qualifications of statesmen and of saints. <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> Yet the spoils of unknown
nations were continually laid at the foot of their throne, and the
uniform ascent of the Arabian greatness must be ascribed to the spirit
of the nation rather than the abilities of their chiefs. A large
deduction must be allowed for the weakness of their enemies. The birth
of Mahomet was fortunately placed in the most degenerate and disorderly
period of the Persians, the Romans, and the Barbarians of Europe: the
empires of Trajan, or even of Constantine or Charlemagne, would
have repelled the assault of the naked Saracens, and the torrent of
fanaticism might have been obscurely lost in the sands of Arabia.

In the victorious days of the Roman republic, it had been the aim of
the senate to confine their councils and legions to a single war,
and completely to suppress a first enemy before they provoked the
hostilities of a second. These timid maxims of policy were disdained
by the magnanimity or enthusiasm of the Arabian caliphs. With the same
vigor and success they invaded the successors of Augustus and those of
Artaxerxes; and the rival monarchies at the same instant became the prey
of an enemy whom they had been so long accustomed to despise. In the
ten years of the administration of Omar, the Saracens reduced to his
obedience thirty-six thousand cities or castles, destroyed four thousand
churches or temples of the unbelievers, and edified fourteen hundred
moschs for the exercise of the religion of Mahomet. One hundred years
after his flight from Mecca, the arms and the reign of his successors
extended from India to the Atlantic Ocean, over the various and distant
provinces, which may be comprised under the names of, I. Persia;
II. Syria; III. Egypt; IV. Africa; and, V. Spain. Under this general
division, I shall proceed to unfold these memorable transactions;
despatching with brevity the remote and less interesting conquests of
the East, and reserving a fuller narrative for those domestic countries
which had been included within the pale of the Roman empire. Yet I
must excuse my own defects by a just complaint of the blindness and
insufficiency of my guides. The Greeks, so loquacious in controversy,
have not been anxious to celebrate the triumphs of their enemies. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a>
After a century of ignorance, the first annals of the Mussulmans were
collected in a great measure from the voice of tradition. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> Among
the numerous productions of Arabic and Persian literature, <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> our
interpreters have selected the imperfect sketches of a more recent
age. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> The art and genius of history have ever been unknown to the
Asiatics; <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> they are ignorant of the laws of criticism; and our
monkish chronicle of the same period may be compared to their most
popular works, which are never vivified by the spirit of philosophy and
freedom.
</p>
<p>
The Oriental library of a Frenchman <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> would instruct the most learned
mufti of the East; and perhaps the Arabs might not find in a single
historian so clear and comprehensive a narrative of their own exploits
as that which will be deduced in the ensuing sheets.

(Nicephori Patriarchae C. P. Breviarium Historicum, Gr. et Lat. Paris,
1648, in folio,) who both lived in the beginning of the ixth century,
(see Hanckius de Scriptor. Byzant. p. 200-246.) Their contemporary,
Photius, does not seem to be more opulent. After praising the style of
Nicephorus, he adds, and only complains of his extreme brevity, (Phot.
Bibliot. Cod. lxvi. p. 100.) Some additions may be gleaned from the more
recent histories of Cedrenus and Zonaras of the xiith century.]

friends, he reduced a work of 30,000 sheets to a more reasonable
size. But his Arabic original is known only by the Persian and Turkish
versions. The Saracenic history of Ebn Amid, or Elmacin, is said to be

[ The particular historians and geographers will be
occasionally introduced. The four following titles represent the Annals
which have guided me in this general narrative. 1. Annales Eutychii,
Patriarchoe Alexandrini, ab Edwardo Pocockio, Oxon. 1656, 2 vols. in
4to. A pompous edition of an indifferent author, translated by Pocock
to gratify the Presbyterian prejudices of his friend Selden. 2. Historia
Saracenica Georgii Elmacini, opera et studio Thomae Erpenii, in 4to.,
Lugd. Batavorum, 1625. He is said to have hastily translated a corrupt
Ms., and his version is often deficient in style and sense. 3. Historia
compendiosa Dynastiarum a Gregorio Abulpharagio, interprete Edwardo
Pocockio, in 4to., Oxon. 1663. More useful for the literary than the
civil history of the East. 4. Abulfedoe Annales Moslemici ad Ann.
Hegiroe ccccvi. a Jo. Jac. Reiske, in 4to., Lipsioe, 1754. The best of
our chronicles, both for the original and version, yet how far below the
name of Abulfeda! We know that he wrote at Hamah in the xivth century.

centuries; the two first, natives of Egypt; a Melchite patriarch, and a

I. In the first year of the first caliph, his lieutenant Caled, the
Sword of God, and the scourge of the infidels, advanced to the banks of
the Euphrates, and reduced the cities of Anbar and Hira. Westward of the
ruins of Babylon, a tribe of sedentary Arabs had fixed themselves on the
verge of the desert; and Hira was the seat of a race of kings who had
embraced the Christian religion, and reigned above six hundred years
under the shadow of the throne of Persia. <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> The last of the Mondars
<a href="#note-1611" name="noteref-1611"><small>1611</small></a> was defeated and slain by Caled; his son was sent a captive to
Medina; his nobles bowed before the successor of the prophet; the people
was tempted by the example and success of their countrymen; and the
caliph accepted as the first-fruits of foreign conquest an annual
tribute of seventy thousand pieces of gold. The conquerors, and even
their historians, were astonished by the dawn of their future greatness:
"In the same year," says Elmacin, "Caled fought many signal battles: an
immense multitude of the infidels was slaughtered; and spoils infinite
and innumerable were acquired by the victorious Moslems." <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> But the
invincible Caled was soon transferred to the Syrian war: the invasion
of the Persian frontier was conducted by less active or less prudent
commanders: the Saracens were repulsed with loss in the passage of
the Euphrates; and, though they chastised the insolent pursuit of the
Magians, their remaining forces still hovered in the desert of Babylon.

The indignation and fears of the Persians suspended for a moment their
intestine divisions. By the unanimous sentence of the priests and
nobles, their queen Arzema was deposed; the sixth of the transient
usurpers, who had arisen and vanished in three or four years since the
death of Chosroes, and the retreat of Heraclius. Her tiara was placed
on the head of Yezdegerd, the grandson of Chosroes; and the same aera,
which coincides with an astronomical period, <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> has recorded the fall
of the Sassanian dynasty and the religion of Zoroaster. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> The youth
and inexperience of the prince (he was only fifteen years of age)
declined a perilous encounter: the royal standard was delivered into the
hands of his general Rustam; and a remnant of thirty thousand regular
troops was swelled in truth, or in opinion, to one hundred and twenty
thousand subjects, or allies, of the great king. The Moslems, whose
numbers were reenforced from twelve to thirty thousand, had pitched
their camp in the plains of Cadesia: <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> and their line, though it
consisted of fewer men, could produce more soldiers, than the unwieldy
host of the infidels. I shall here observe, what I must often repeat,
that the charge of the Arabs was not, like that of the Greeks and
Romans, the effort of a firm and compact infantry: their military force
was chiefly formed of cavalry and archers; and the engagement, which
was often interrupted and often renewed by single combats and flying
skirmishes, might be protracted without any decisive event to the
continuance of several days. The periods of the battle of Cadesia
were distinguished by their peculiar appellations. The first, from
the well-timed appearance of six thousand of the Syrian brethren, was
denominated the day of succor. The day of concussion might express
the disorder of one, or perhaps of both, of the contending armies. The
third, a nocturnal tumult, received the whimsical name of the night
of barking, from the discordant clamors, which were compared to
the inarticulate sounds of the fiercest animals. The morning of the
succeeding day <a href="#note-2011" name="noteref-2011"><small>2011</small></a> determined the fate of Persia; and a seasonable
whirlwind drove a cloud of dust against the faces of the unbelievers.
The clangor of arms was reechoed to the tent of Rustam, who, far
unlike the ancient hero of his name, was gently reclining in a cool and
tranquil shade, amidst the baggage of his camp, and the train of mules
that were laden with gold and silver. On the sound of danger he started
from his couch; but his flight was overtaken by a valiant Arab, who
caught him by the foot, struck off his head, hoisted it on a lance, and
instantly returning to the field of battle, carried slaughter and dismay
among the thickest ranks of the Persians. The Saracens confess a loss
of seven thousand five hundred men; <a href="#note-2012" name="noteref-2012"><small>2012</small></a> and the battle of Cadesia is
justly described by the epithets of obstinate and atrocious. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> The
standard of the monarchy was overthrown and captured in the field&mdash;a
leathern apron of a blacksmith, who in ancient times had arisen the
deliverer of Persia; but this badge of heroic poverty was disguised,
and almost concealed, by a profusion of precious gems. <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> After this
victory, the wealthy province of Irak, or Assyria, submitted to
the caliph, and his conquests were firmly established by the speedy
foundation of Bassora, <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> a place which ever commands the trade and
navigation of the Persians. As the distance of fourscore miles from
the Gulf, the Euphrates and Tigris unite in a broad and direct current,
which is aptly styled the river of the Arabs. In the midway, between the
junction and the mouth of these famous streams, the new settlement was
planted on the western bank: the first colony was composed of eight
hundred Moslems; but the influence of the situation soon reared a
flourishing and populous capital. The air, though excessively hot, is
pure and healthy: the meadows are filled with palm-trees and cattle; and
one of the adjacent valleys has been celebrated among the four paradises
or gardens of Asia. Under the first caliphs the jurisdiction of this
Arabian colony extended over the southern provinces of Persia: the city
has been sanctified by the tombs of the companions and martyrs; and the
vessels of Europe still frequent the port of Bassora, as a convenient
station and passage of the Indian trade.

<h2>
    Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
After the defeat of Cadesia, a country intersected by rivers and canals
might have opposed an insuperable barrier to the victorious cavalry; and
the walls of Ctesiphon or Madayn, which had resisted the battering-rams
of the Romans, would not have yielded to the darts of the Saracens. But
the flying Persians were overcome by the belief, that the last day
of their religion and empire was at hand; the strongest posts were
abandoned by treachery or cowardice; and the king, with a part of his
family and treasures, escaped to Holwan at the foot of the Median hills.
</p>
<p>
In the third month after the battle, Said, the lieutenant of Omar,
passed the Tigris without opposition; the capital was taken by assault;
and the disorderly resistance of the people gave a keener edge to the
sabres of the Moslems, who shouted with religious transport, "This is
the white palace of Chosroes; this is the promise of the apostle of
God!" The naked robbers of the desert were suddenly enriched beyond the
measure of their hope or knowledge. Each chamber revealed a new treasure
secreted with art, or ostentatiously displayed; the gold and silver, the
various wardrobes and precious furniture, surpassed (says Abulfeda) the
estimate of fancy or numbers; and another historian defines the untold
and almost infinite mass, by the fabulous computation of three thousands
of thousands of thousands of pieces of gold. <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> Some minute though
curious facts represent the contrast of riches and ignorance. From the
remote islands of the Indian Ocean a large provision of camphire <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a>
had been imported, which is employed with a mixture of wax to illuminate
the palaces of the East. Strangers to the name and properties of that
odoriferous gum, the Saracens, mistaking it for salt, mingled the
camphire in their bread, and were astonished at the bitterness of the
taste. One of the apartments of the palace was decorated with a carpet
of silk, sixty cubits in length, and as many in breadth: a paradise or
garden was depictured on the ground: the flowers, fruits, and shrubs,
were imitated by the figures of the gold embroidery, and the colors of
the precious stones; and the ample square was encircled by a variegated
and verdant border. <a href="#note-251" name="noteref-251"><small>251</small></a> The Arabian general persuaded his soldiers
to relinquish their claim, in the reasonable hope that the eyes of the
caliph would be delighted with the splendid workmanship of nature and
industry. Regardless of the merit of art, and the pomp of royalty, the
rigid Omar divided the prize among his brethren of Medina: the picture
was destroyed; but such was the intrinsic value of the materials, that
the share of Ali alone was sold for twenty thousand drams. A mule that
carried away the tiara and cuirass, the belt and bracelets of Chosroes,
was overtaken by the pursuers; the gorgeous trophy was presented to
the commander of the faithful; and the gravest of the companions
condescended to smile when they beheld the white beard, the hairy arms,
and uncouth figure of the veteran, who was invested with the spoils of
the Great King. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> The sack of Ctesiphon was followed by its desertion
and gradual decay. The Saracens disliked the air and situation of
the place, and Omar was advised by his general to remove the seat of
government to the western side of the Euphrates. In every age, the
foundation and ruin of the Assyrian cities has been easy and rapid: the
country is destitute of stone and timber; and the most solid structures
<a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> are composed of bricks baked in the sun, and joined by a cement
of the native bitumen. The name of Cufa <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> describes a habitation of
reeds and earth; but the importance of the new capital was supported
by the numbers, wealth, and spirit, of a colony of veterans; and their
licentiousness was indulged by the wisest caliphs, who were apprehensive
of provoking the revolt of a hundred thousand swords: "Ye men of Cufa,"
said Ali, who solicited their aid, "you have been always conspicuous by
your valor. You conquered the Persian king, and scattered his forces,
till you had taken possession of his inheritance." This mighty conquest
was achieved by the battles of Jalula and Nehavend. After the loss of
the former, Yezdegerd fled from Holwan, and concealed his shame and
despair in the mountains of Farsistan, from whence Cyrus had descended
with his equal and valiant companions. The courage of the nation
survived that of the monarch: among the hills to the south of Ecbatana
or Hamadan, one hundred and fifty thousand Persians made a third and
final stand for their religion and country; and the decisive battle of
Nehavend was styled by the Arabs the victory of victories. If it be true
that the flying general of the Persians was stopped and overtaken in a
crowd of mules and camels laden with honey, the incident, however slight
and singular, will denote the luxurious impediments of an Oriental army.

The geography of Persia is darkly delineated by the Greeks and Latins;
but the most illustrious of her cities appear to be more ancient than
the invasion of the Arabs. By the reduction of Hamadan and Ispahan, of
Caswin, Tauris, and Rei, they gradually approached the shores of the
Caspian Sea: and the orators of Mecca might applaud the success and
spirit of the faithful, who had already lost sight of the northern
bear, and had almost transcended the bounds of the habitable world. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a>
Again, turning towards the West and the Roman empire, they repassed
the Tigris over the bridge of Mosul, and, in the captive provinces
of Armenia and Mesopotamia, embraced their victorious brethren of the
Syrian army. From the palace of Madayn their Eastern progress was not
less rapid or extensive. They advanced along the Tigris and the Gulf;
penetrated through the passes of the mountains into the valley of
Estachar or Persepolis, and profaned the last sanctuary of the Magian
empire. The grandson of Chosroes was nearly surprised among the falling
columns and mutilated figures; a sad emblem of the past and present
fortune of Persia: <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> he fled with accelerated haste over the desert
of Kirman, implored the aid of the warlike Segestans, and sought an
humble refuge on the verge of the Turkish and Chinese power. But a
victorious army is insensible of fatigue: the Arabs divided their forces
in the pursuit of a timorous enemy; and the caliph Othman promised the
government of Chorasan to the first general who should enter that
large and populous country, the kingdom of the ancient Bactrians. The
condition was accepted; the prize was deserved; the standard of Mahomet
was planted on the walls of Herat, Merou, and Balch; and the successful
leader neither halted nor reposed till his foaming cavalry had tasted
the waters of the Oxus. In the public anarchy, the independent governors
of the cities and castles obtained their separate capitulations: the
terms were granted or imposed by the esteem, the prudence, or the
compassion, of the victors; and a simple profession of faith established
the distinction between a brother and a slave. After a noble defence,
Harmozan, the prince or satrap of Ahwaz and Susa, was compelled to
surrender his person and his state to the discretion of the caliph;
and their interview exhibits a portrait of the Arabian manners. In the
presence, and by the command, of Omar, the gay Barbarian was despoiled
of his silken robes embroidered with gold, and of his tiara bedecked
with rubies and emeralds: "Are you now sensible," said the conqueror to
his naked captive&mdash;"are you now sensible of the judgment of God, and
of the different rewards of infidelity and obedience?" "Alas!" replied
Harmozan, "I feel them too deeply. In the days of our common ignorance,
we fought with the weapons of the flesh, and my nation was superior. God
was then neuter: since he has espoused your quarrel, you have subverted
our kingdom and religion." Oppressed by this painful dialogue,
the Persian complained of intolerable thirst, but discovered some
apprehension lest he should be killed whilst he was drinking a cup of
water. "Be of good courage," said the caliph; "your life is safe till
you have drunk this water:" the crafty satrap accepted the assurance,
and instantly dashed the vase against the ground. Omar would have
avenged the deceit, but his companions represented the sanctity of an
oath; and the speedy conversion of Harmozan entitled him not only to a
free pardon, but even to a stipend of two thousand pieces of gold.
The administration of Persia was regulated by an actual survey of the
people, the cattle, and the fruits of the earth; <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> and this monument,
which attests the vigilance of the caliphs, might have instructed the

The flight of Yezdegerd had carried him beyond the Oxus, and as far
as the Jaxartes, two rivers <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> of ancient and modern renown, which
descend from the mountains of India towards the Caspian Sea. He was
hospitably entertained by Takhan, prince of Fargana, <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> a fertile
province on the Jaxartes: the king of Samarcand, with the Turkish tribes
of Sogdiana and Scythia, were moved by the lamentations and promises of
the fallen monarch; and he solicited, by a suppliant embassy, the more
solid and powerful friendship of the emperor of China. <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> The virtuous
Taitsong, <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> the first of the dynasty of the Tang may be justly

of prosperity and peace; and his dominion was acknowledged by forty-four
hordes of the Barbarians of Tartary. His last garrisons of Cashgar and
Khoten maintained a frequent intercourse with their neighbors of the
Jaxartes and Oxus; a recent colony of Persians had introduced into China
the astronomy of the Magi; and Taitsong might be alarmed by the rapid
progress and dangerous vicinity of the Arabs. The influence, and perhaps
the supplies, of China revived the hopes of Yezdegerd and the zeal
of the worshippers of fire; and he returned with an army of Turks to
conquer the inheritance of his fathers. The fortunate Moslems, without
unsheathing their swords, were the spectators of his ruin and death.
The grandson of Chosroes was betrayed by his servant, insulted by the
seditious inhabitants of Merou, and oppressed, defeated, and pursued by
his Barbarian allies. He reached the banks of a river, and offered his
rings and bracelets for an instant passage in a miller's boat. Ignorant
or insensible of royal distress, the rustic replied, that four drams of
silver were the daily profit of his mill, and that he would not suspend
his work unless the loss were repaid. In this moment of hesitation and
delay, the last of the Sassanian kings was overtaken and slaughtered by

After the fall of the Persian kingdom, the River Oxus divided the
territories of the Saracens and of the Turks. This narrow boundary was
soon overleaped by the spirit of the Arabs; the governors of Chorasan
extended their successive inroads; and one of their triumphs was adorned
with the buskin of a Turkish queen, which she dropped in her precipitate
flight beyond the hills of Bochara. <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> But the final conquest of
Transoxiana, <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> as well as of Spain, was reserved for the glorious
reign of the inactive Walid; and the name of Catibah, the camel driver,
declares the origin and merit of his successful lieutenant. While one of
his colleagues displayed the first Mahometan banner on the banks of
the Indus, the spacious regions between the Oxus, the Jaxartes, and the
Caspian Sea, were reduced by the arms of Catibah to the obedience of the
prophet and of the caliph. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> A tribute of two millions of pieces of
gold was imposed on the infidels; their idols were burnt or broken; the
Mussulman chief pronounced a sermon in the new mosch of Carizme; after
several battles, the Turkish hordes were driven back to the desert; and
the emperors of China solicited the friendship of the victorious Arabs.
To their industry, the prosperity of the province, the Sogdiana of the
ancients, may in a great measure be ascribed; but the advantages of the
soil and climate had been understood and cultivated since the reign
of the Macedonian kings. Before the invasion of the Saracens, Carizme,
Bochara, and Samarcand were rich and populous under the yoke of the
shepherds of the north. <a href="#note-4211" name="noteref-4211"><small>4211</small></a> These cities were surrounded with a
double wall; and the exterior fortification, of a larger circumference,
enclosed the fields and gardens of the adjacent district. The mutual
wants of India and Europe were supplied by the diligence of the Sogdian
merchants; and the inestimable art of transforming linen into paper has
been diffused from the manufacture of Samarcand over the western world.

II. No sooner had Abubeker restored the unity of faith and government,
than he despatched a circular letter to the Arabian tribes. "In the name
of the most merciful God, to the rest of the true believers. Health and
happiness, and the mercy and blessing of God, be upon you. I praise the
most high God, and I pray for his prophet Mahomet. This is to acquaint
you, that I intend to send the true believers into Syria <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> to take
it out of the hands of the infidels. And I would have you know, that
the fighting for religion is an act of obedience to God." His messengers
returned with the tidings of pious and martial ardor which they had
kindled in every province; and the camp of Medina was successively
filled with the intrepid bands of the Saracens, who panted for action,
complained of the heat of the season and the scarcity of provisions,
and accused with impatient murmurs the delays of the caliph. As soon as
their numbers were complete, Abubeker ascended the hill, reviewed the
men, the horses, and the arms, and poured forth a fervent prayer for the
success of their undertaking. In person, and on foot, he accompanied the
first day's march; and when the blushing leaders attempted to dismount,
the caliph removed their scruples by a declaration, that those who
rode, and those who walked, in the service of religion, were equally
meritorious. His instructions <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> to the chiefs of the Syrian army were
inspired by the warlike fanaticism which advances to seize, and affects
to despise, the objects of earthly ambition. "Remember," said the
successor of the prophet, "that you are always in the presence of God,
on the verge of death, in the assurance of judgment, and the hope of
paradise. Avoid injustice and oppression; consult with your brethren,
and study to preserve the love and confidence of your troops. When
you fight the battles of the Lord, acquit yourselves like men, without
turning your backs; but let not your victory be stained with the blood
of women or children. Destroy no palm-trees, nor burn any fields of
corn. Cut down no fruit-trees, nor do any mischief to cattle, only such
as you kill to eat. When you make any covenant or article, stand to it,
and be as good as your word. As you go on, you will find some religious
persons who live retired in monasteries, and propose to themselves to
serve God that way: let them alone, and neither kill them nor destroy
their monasteries: <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> And you will find another sort of people, that
belong to the synagogue of Satan, who have shaven crowns; <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> be sure
you cleave their skulls, and give them no quarter till they either turn
Mahometans or pay tribute." All profane or frivolous conversation,
all dangerous recollection of ancient quarrels, was severely prohibited
among the Arabs: in the tumult of a camp, the exercises of religion
were assiduously practised; and the intervals of action were employed in
prayer, meditation, and the study of the Koran. The abuse, or even the
use, of wine was chastised by fourscore strokes on the soles of the
feet, and in the fervor of their primitive zeal, many secret sinners
revealed their fault, and solicited their punishment. After some
hesitation, the command of the Syrian army was delegated to Abu Obeidah,
one of the fugitives of Mecca, and companions of Mahomet; whose zeal and
devotion was assuaged, without being abated, by the singular mildness
and benevolence of his temper. But in all the emergencies of war, the
soldiers demanded the superior genius of Caled; and whoever might be
the choice of the prince, the Sword of God was both in fact and fame the
foremost leader of the Saracens. He obeyed without reluctance; <a href="#note-4711" name="noteref-4711"><small>4711</small></a> he
was consulted without jealousy; and such was the spirit of the man, or
rather of the times, that Caled professed his readiness to serve under
the banner of the faith, though it were in the hands of a child or an
enemy. Glory, and riches, and dominion, were indeed promised to the
victorious Mussulman; but he was carefully instructed, that if the goods
of this life were his only incitement, they likewise would be his only
reward.

Another expedition of the conquerors of Damascus will equally display
their avidity and their contempt for the riches of the present world.
They were informed that the produce and manufactures of the country were
annually collected in the fair of Abyla, <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> about thirty miles from
the city; that the cell of a devout hermit was visited at the same
time by a multitude of pilgrims; and that the festival of trade and
superstition would be ennobled by the nuptials of the daughter of the
governor of Tripoli. Abdallah, the son of Jaafar, a glorious and holy
martyr, undertook, with a banner of five hundred horse, the pious and
profitable commission of despoiling the infidels. As he approached the
fair of Abyla, he was astonished by the report of this mighty concourse
of Jews and Christians, Greeks, and Armenians, of natives of Syria and
of strangers of Egypt, to the number of ten thousand, besides a guard of
five thousand horse that attended the person of the bride. The Saracens
paused: "For my own part," said Abdallah, "I dare not go back: our foes
are many, our danger is great, but our reward is splendid and secure,
either in this life or in the life to come. Let every man, according
to his inclination, advance or retire." Not a Mussulman deserted his
standard. "Lead the way," said Abdallah to his Christian guide, "and you
shall see what the companions of the prophet can perform." They charged
in five squadrons; but after the first advantage of the surprise,
they were encompassed and almost overwhelmed by the multitude of their
enemies; and their valiant band is fancifully compared to a white spot
in the skin of a black camel. <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> About the hour of sunset, when their
weapons dropped from their hands, when they panted on the verge of
eternity, they discovered an approaching cloud of dust; they heard the
welcome sound of the tecbir, <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> and they soon perceived the standard
of Caled, who flew to their relief with the utmost speed of his cavalry.
The Christians were broken by his attack, and slaughtered in their
flight, as far as the river of Tripoli. They left behind them the
various riches of the fair; the merchandises that were exposed for sale,
the money that was brought for purchase, the gay decorations of
the nuptials, and the governor's daughter, with forty of her female
attendants.

The fruits, provisions, and furniture, the money, plate, and jewels,
were diligently laden on the backs of horses, asses, and mules; and the
holy robbers returned in triumph to Damascus. The hermit, after a short

was left alive in the solitary scene of blood and devastation.

<p>
Syria, <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> one of the countries that have been improved by the most
early cultivation, is not unworthy of the preference. <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> The heat of
the climate is tempered by the vicinity of the sea and mountains, by the
plenty of wood and water; and the produce of a fertile soil affords the
subsistence, and encourages the propagation, of men and animals. From
the age of David to that of Heraclius, the country was overspread
with ancient and flourishing cities: the inhabitants were numerous and
wealthy; and, after the slow ravage of despotism and superstition, after
the recent calamities of the Persian war, Syria could still attract
and reward the rapacious tribes of the desert. A plain, of ten days'
journey, from Damascus to Aleppo and Antioch, is watered, on the western
side, by the winding course of the Orontes. The hills of Libanus and
Anti-Libanus are planted from north to south, between the Orontes and
the Mediterranean; and the epithet of hollow (Coelesyria) was applied to
a long and fruitful valley, which is confined in the same direction,
by the two ridges of snowy mountains. <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> Among the cities, which are
enumerated by Greek and Oriental names in the geography and conquest
of Syria, we may distinguish Emesa or Hems, Heliopolis or Baalbec, the
former as the metropolis of the plain, the latter as the capital of the
valley. Under the last of the Caesars, they were strong and populous;
the turrets glittered from afar: an ample space was covered with public
and private buildings; and the citizens were illustrious by their
spirit, or at least by their pride; by their riches, or at least by
their luxury. In the days of Paganism, both Emesa and Heliopolis were
addicted to the worship of Baal, or the sun; but the decline of their
superstition and splendor has been marked by a singular variety of
fortune. Not a vestige remains of the temple of Emesa, which was
equalled in poetic style to the summits of Mount Libanus, <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> while
the ruins of Baalbec, invisible to the writers of antiquity, excite the
curiosity and wonder of the European traveller. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> The measure of the
temple is two hundred feet in length, and one hundred in breadth: the
front is adorned with a double portico of eight columns; fourteen may be
counted on either side; and each column, forty-five feet in height, is
composed of three massy blocks of stone or marble. The proportions
and ornaments of the Corinthian order express the architecture of the
Greeks: but as Baalbec has never been the seat of a monarch, we are at
a loss to conceive how the expense of these magnificent structures could
be supplied by private or municipal liberality. <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> From the conquest
of Damascus the Saracens proceeded to Heliopolis and Emesa: but I
shall decline the repetition of the sallies and combats which have been
already shown on a larger scale. In the prosecution of the war, their
policy was not less effectual than their sword. By short and separate
truces they dissolved the union of the enemy; accustomed the Syrians
to compare their friendship with their enmity; familiarized the idea
of their language, religion, and manners; and exhausted, by clandestine
purchase, the magazines and arsenals of the cities which they returned
to besiege. They aggravated the ransom of the more wealthy, or the more
obstinate; and Chalcis alone was taxed at five thousand ounces of gold,
five thousand ounces of silver, two thousand robes of silk, and as many
figs and olives as would load five thousand asses. But the terms of
truce or capitulation were faithfully observed; and the lieutenant
of the caliph, who had promised not to enter the walls of the captive
Baalbec, remained tranquil and immovable in his tent till the jarring
factions solicited the interposition of a foreign master. The conquest
of the plain and valley of Syria was achieved in less than two years.
Yet the commander of the faithful reproved the slowness of their
progress; and the Saracens, bewailing their fault with tears of rage and
repentance, called aloud on their chiefs to lead them forth to fight the
battles of the Lord. In a recent action, under the walls of Emesa,
an Arabian youth, the cousin of Caled, was heard aloud to exclaim,
"Methinks I see the black-eyed girls looking upon me; one of whom,
should she appear in this world, all mankind would die for love of her.
And I see in the hand of one of them a handkerchief of green silk, and
a cap of precious stones, and she beckons me, and calls out, Come hither
quickly, for I love thee." With these words, charging the Christians, he
made havoc wherever he went, till, observed at length by the governor of
Hems, he was struck through with a javelin.

It was incumbent on the Saracens to exert the full powers of their valor
and enthusiasm against the forces of the emperor, who was taught, by
repeated losses, that the rovers of the desert had undertaken, and would
speedily achieve, a regular and permanent conquest. From the provinces
of Europe and Asia, fourscore thousand soldiers were transported by sea
and land to Antioch and Caesarea: the light troops of the army consisted
of sixty thousand Christian Arabs of the tribe of Gassan. Under the
banner of Jabalah, the last of their princes, they marched in the
van; and it was a maxim of the Greeks, that for the purpose of cutting
diamond, a diamond was the most effectual. Heraclius withheld his person
from the dangers of the field; but his presumption, or perhaps his
despondency, suggested a peremptory order, that the fate of the province
and the war should be decided by a single battle. The Syrians were
attached to the standard of Rome and of the cross: but the noble, the
citizen, the peasant, were exasperated by the injustice and cruelty of
a licentious host, who oppressed them as subjects, and despised them
as strangers and aliens. <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> A report of these mighty preparations was
conveyed to the Saracens in their camp of Emesa, and the chiefs, though
resolved to fight, assembled a council: the faith of Abu Obeidah would
have expected on the same spot the glory of martyrdom; the wisdom
of Caled advised an honorable retreat to the skirts of Palestine and
Arabia, where they might await the succors of their friends, and the
attack of the unbelievers. A speedy messenger soon returned from the
throne of Medina, with the blessings of Omar and Ali, the prayers of the
widows of the prophet, and a reenforcement of eight thousand Moslems. In
their way they overturned a detachment of Greeks, and when they
joined at Yermuk the camp of their brethren, they found the pleasing
intelligence, that Caled had already defeated and scattered the
Christian Arabs of the tribe of Gassan. In the neighborhood of Bosra,
the springs of Mount Hermon descend in a torrent to the plain of
Decapolis, or ten cities; and the Hieromax, a name which has been
corrupted to Yermuk, is lost, after a short course, in the Lake of
Tiberias. <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> The banks of this obscure stream were illustrated by a
long and bloody encounter. <a href="#note-7411" name="noteref-7411"><small>7411</small></a> On this momentous occasion, the public
voice, and the modesty of Abu Obeidah, restored the command to the most
deserving of the Moslems. Caled assumed his station in the front, his
colleague was posted in the rear, that the disorder of the fugitive
might be checked by his venerable aspect, and the sight of the yellow
banner which Mahomet had displayed before the walls of Chaibar. The last
line was occupied by the sister of Derar, with the Arabian women who had
enlisted in this holy war, who were accustomed to wield the bow and
the lance, and who in a moment of captivity had defended, against
the uncircumcised ravishers, their chastity and religion. <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> The
exhortation of the generals was brief and forcible: "Paradise is before
you, the devil and hell-fire in your rear." Yet such was the weight
of the Roman cavalry, that the right wing of the Arabs was broken and
separated from the main body. Thrice did they retreat in disorder, and
thrice were they driven back to the charge by the reproaches and blows
of the women. In the intervals of action, Abu Obeidah visited the tents
of his brethren, prolonged their repose by repeating at once the prayers
of two different hours, bound up their wounds with his own hands, and
administered the comfortable reflection, that the infidels partook of
their sufferings without partaking of their reward. Four thousand and
thirty of the Moslems were buried in the field of battle; and the skill
of the Armenian archers enabled seven hundred to boast that they had
lost an eye in that meritorious service. The veterans of the Syrian war
acknowledged that it was the hardest and most doubtful of the days which
they had seen. But it was likewise the most decisive: many thousands
of the Greeks and Syrians fell by the swords of the Arabs; many were
slaughtered, after the defeat, in the woods and mountains; many, by
mistaking the ford, were drowned in the waters of the Yermuk; and
however the loss may be magnified, <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a> the Christian writers confess
and bewail the bloody punishment of their sins. <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> Manuel, the Roman
general, was either killed at Damascus, or took refuge in the monastery
of Mount Sinai. An exile in the Byzantine court, Jabalah lamented the
manners of Arabia, and his unlucky preference of the Christian cause.
<a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> He had once inclined to the profession of Islam; but in the
pilgrimage of Mecca, Jabalah was provoked to strike one of his brethren,
and fled with amazement from the stern and equal justice of the caliph
These victorious Saracens enjoyed at Damascus a month of pleasure and
repose: the spoil was divided by the discretion of Abu Obeidah: an equal
share was allotted to a soldier and to his horse, and a double portion
was reserved for the noble coursers of the Arabian breed.

After the battle of Yermuk, the Roman army no longer appeared in the
field; and the Saracens might securely choose, among the fortified towns
of Syria, the first object of their attack. They consulted the caliph
whether they should march to Caesarea or Jerusalem; and the advice of
Ali determined the immediate siege of the latter. To a profane eye,
Jerusalem was the first or second capital of Palestine; but after Mecca
and Medina, it was revered and visited by the devout Moslems, as the
temple of the Holy Land which had been sanctified by the revelation of
Moses, of Jesus, and of Mahomet himself. The son of Abu Sophian was
sent with five thousand Arabs to try the first experiment of surprise
or treaty; but on the eleventh day, the town was invested by the whole
force of Abu Obeidah. He addressed the customary summons to the chief
commanders and people of Aelia. <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a>

forthwith. Otherwise I shall bring men against you who love death better
than you do the drinking of wine or eating hog's flesh. Nor will I ever
stir from you, if it please God, till I have destroyed those that fight
for you, and made slaves of your children." But the city was defended
on every side by deep valleys and steep ascents; since the invasion of
Syria, the walls and towers had been anxiously restored; the bravest of
the fugitives of Yermuk had stopped in the nearest place of refuge; and
in the defence of the sepulchre of Christ, the natives and strangers
might feel some sparks of the enthusiasm, which so fiercely glowed in
the bosoms of the Saracens. The siege of Jerusalem lasted four months;
not a day was lost without some action of sally or assault; the military
engines incessantly played from the ramparts; and the inclemency of
the winter was still more painful and destructive to the Arabs. The
Christians yielded at length to the perseverance of the besiegers.
The patriarch Sophronius appeared on the walls, and by the voice of
an interpreter demanded a conference. <a href="#note-7911" name="noteref-7911"><small>7911</small></a> After a vain attempt to
dissuade the lieutenant of the caliph from his impious enterprise, he
proposed, in the name of the people, a fair capitulation, with this
extraordinary clause, that the articles of security should be ratified
by the authority and presence of Omar himself. The question was debated
in the council of Medina; the sanctity of the place, and the advice
of Ali, persuaded the caliph to gratify the wishes of his soldiers and
enemies; and the simplicity of his journey is more illustrious than the
royal pageants of vanity and oppression. The conqueror of Persia and
Syria was mounted on a red camel, which carried, besides his person,
a bag of corn, a bag of dates, a wooden dish, and a leathern bottle of
water. Wherever he halted, the company, without distinction, was invited
to partake of his homely fare, and the repast was consecrated by the
prayer and exhortation of the commander of the faithful. <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> But
in this expedition or pilgrimage, his power was exercised in the
administration of justice: he reformed the licentious polygamy of
the Arabs, relieved the tributaries from extortion and cruelty, and
chastised the luxury of the Saracens, by despoiling them of their rich
silks, and dragging them on their faces in the dirt. When he came
within sight of Jerusalem, the caliph cried with a loud voice, "God is
victorious. O Lord, give us an easy conquest!" and, pitching his tent
of coarse hair, calmly seated himself on the ground. After signing
the capitulation, he entered the city without fear or precaution; and
courteously discoursed with the patriarch concerning its religious
antiquities. <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> Sophronius bowed before his new master, and secretly
muttered, in the words of Daniel, "The abomination of desolation is in
the holy place." <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a> At the hour of prayer they stood together in
the church of the resurrection; but the caliph refused to perform his
devotions, and contented himself with praying on the steps of the church
of Constantine. To the patriarch he disclosed his prudent and honorable
motive. "Had I yielded," said Omar, "to your request, the Moslems of a
future age would have infringed the treaty under color of imitating
my example." By his command the ground of the temple of Solomon was
prepared for the foundation of a mosch; <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> and, during a residence
of ten days, he regulated the present and future state of his Syrian
conquests. Medina might be jealous, lest the caliph should be
detained by the sanctity of Jerusalem or the beauty of Damascus; her
apprehensions were dispelled by his prompt and voluntary return to the
tomb of the apostle. <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a>

<p>
To achieve what yet remained of the Syrian war the caliph had formed two
separate armies; a chosen detachment, under Amrou and Yezid, was left in
the camp of Palestine; while the larger division, under the standard
of Abu Obeidah and Caled, marched away to the north against Antioch
and Aleppo. The latter of these, the Beraea of the Greeks, was not
yet illustrious as the capital of a province or a kingdom; and the
inhabitants, by anticipating their submission and pleading their
poverty, obtained a moderate composition for their lives and religion.
But the castle of Aleppo, <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> distinct from the city, stood erect on
a lofty artificial mound the sides were sharpened to a precipice, and
faced with free-stone; and the breadth of the ditch might be filled with
water from the neighboring springs. After the loss of three thousand
men, the garrison was still equal to the defence; and Youkinna, their
valiant and hereditary chief, had murdered his brother, a holy monk,
for daring to pronounce the name of peace. In a siege of four or five
months, the hardest of the Syrian war, great numbers of the Saracens
were killed and wounded: their removal to the distance of a mile could
not seduce the vigilance of Youkinna; nor could the Christians be
terrified by the execution of three hundred captives, whom they beheaded
before the castle wall. The silence, and at length the complaints,
of Abu Obeidah informed the caliph that their hope and patience were
consumed at the foot of this impregnable fortress. "I am variously
affected," replied Omar, "by the difference of your success; but I
charge you by no means to raise the siege of the castle. Your retreat
would diminish the reputation of our arms, and encourage the infidels
to fall upon you on all sides. Remain before Aleppo till God shall
determine the event, and forage with your horse round the adjacent
country." The exhortation of the commander of the faithful was fortified
by a supply of volunteers from all the tribes of Arabia, who arrived in
the camp on horses or camels. Among these was Dames, of a servile birth,
but of gigantic size and intrepid resolution. The forty-seventh day of
his service he proposed, with only thirty men, to make an attempt on the
castle. The experience and testimony of Caled recommended his offer; and
Abu Obeidah admonished his brethren not to despise the baser origin
of Dames, since he himself, could he relinquish the public care, would
cheerfully serve under the banner of the slave. His design was covered
by the appearance of a retreat; and the camp of the Saracens was pitched
about a league from Aleppo. The thirty adventurers lay in ambush at the
foot of the hill; and Dames at length succeeded in his inquiries, though
he was provoked by the ignorance of his Greek captives. "God curse these
dogs," said the illiterate Arab; "what a strange barbarous language they
speak!" At the darkest hour of the night, he scaled the most accessible
height, which he had diligently surveyed, a place where the stones
were less entire, or the slope less perpendicular, or the guard less
vigilant. Seven of the stoutest Saracens mounted on each other's
shoulders, and the weight of the column was sustained on the broad and
sinewy back of the gigantic slave. The foremost in this painful ascent
could grasp and climb the lowest part of the battlements; they silently
stabbed and cast down the sentinels; and the thirty brethren, repeating
a pious ejaculation, "O apostle of God, help and deliver us!" were
successively drawn up by the long folds of their turbans. With bold
and cautious footsteps, Dames explored the palace of the governor, who
celebrated, in riotous merriment, the festival of his deliverance. From
thence, returning to his companions, he assaulted on the inside the
entrance of the castle. They overpowered the guard, unbolted the gate,
let down the drawbridge, and defended the narrow pass, till the arrival
of Caled, with the dawn of day, relieved their danger and assured
their conquest. Youkinna, a formidable foe, became an active and useful
proselyte; and the general of the Saracens expressed his regard for the
most humble merit, by detaining the army at Aleppo till Dames was cured
of his honorable wounds. The capital of Syria was still covered by the
castle of Aazaz and the iron bridge of the Orontes. After the loss of
those important posts, and the defeat of the last of the Roman armies,
the luxury of Antioch <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> trembled and obeyed. Her safety was ransomed
with three hundred thousand pieces of gold; but the throne of the
successors of Alexander, the seat of the Roman government of the East,
which had been decorated by Caesar with the titles of free, and
holy, and inviolate was degraded under the yoke of the caliphs to the
secondary rank of a provincial town. <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a>

In the life of Heraclius, the glories of the Persian war are clouded on
either hand by the disgrace and weakness of his more early and his later
days. When the successors of Mahomet unsheathed the sword of war and
religion, he was astonished at the boundless prospect of toil and
danger; his nature was indolent, nor could the infirm and frigid age of
the emperor be kindled to a second effort. The sense of shame, and the
importunities of the Syrians, prevented the hasty departure from the
scene of action; but the hero was no more; and the loss of Damascus and
Jerusalem, the bloody fields of Aiznadin and Yermuk, may be imputed in
some degree to the absence or misconduct of the sovereign. Instead of
defending the sepulchre of Christ, he involved the church and state in a
metaphysical controversy for the unity of his will; and while Heraclius
crowned the offspring of his second nuptials, he was tamely stripped
of the most valuable part of their inheritance. In the cathedral of
Antioch, in the presence of the bishops, at the foot of the crucifix,
he bewailed the sins of the prince and people; but his confession
instructed the world, that it was vain, and perhaps impious, to resist
the judgment of God. The Saracens were invincible in fact, since they
were invincible in opinion; and the desertion of Youkinna, his false
repentance and repeated perfidy, might justify the suspicion of
the emperor, that he was encompassed by traitors and apostates, who
conspired to betray his person and their country to the enemies of
Christ. In the hour of adversity, his superstition was agitated by
the omens and dreams of a falling crown; and after bidding an eternal
farewell to Syria, he secretly embarked with a few attendants, and
absolved the faith of his subjects. <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> Constantine, his eldest son,
had been stationed with forty thousand men at Caesarea, the civil
metropolis of the three provinces of Palestine. But his private interest
recalled him to the Byzantine court; and, after the flight of his
father, he felt himself an unequal champion to the united force of the
caliph. His vanguard was boldly attacked by three hundred Arabs and
a thousand black slaves, who, in the depth of winter, had climbed
the snowy mountains of Libanus, and who were speedily followed by the
victorious squadrons of Caled himself. From the north and south the
troops of Antioch and Jerusalem advanced along the sea-shore till their
banners were joined under the walls of the Phoenician cities: Tripoli
and Tyre were betrayed; and a fleet of fifty transports, which entered
without distrust the captive harbors, brought a seasonable supply of
arms and provisions to the camp of the Saracens. Their labors were
terminated by the unexpected surrender of Caesarea: the Roman prince had
embarked in the night; <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> and the defenceless citizens solicited their
pardon with an offering of two hundred thousand pieces of gold.
The remainder of the province, Ramlah, Ptolemais or Acre, Sichem or

<h2>
    Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>
<p>
The sieges and battles of six campaigns had consumed many thousands
of the Moslems. They died with the reputation and the cheerfulness of
martyrs; and the simplicity of their faith may be expressed in the words
of an Arabian youth, when he embraced, for the last time, his sister and
mother: "It is not," said he, "the delicacies of Syria, or the fading
delights of this world, that have prompted me to devote my life in the
cause of religion. But I seek the favor of God and his apostle; and I
have heard, from one of the companions of the prophet, that the spirits
of the martyrs will be lodged in the crops of green birds, who shall
taste the fruits, and drink of the rivers, of paradise. Farewell, we
shall meet again among the groves and fountains which God has provided
for his elect." The faithful captives might exercise a passive and more
arduous resolution; and a cousin of Mahomet is celebrated for refusing,
after an abstinence of three days, the wine and pork, the only
nourishment that was allowed by the malice of the infidels. The frailty
of some weaker brethren exasperated the implacable spirit of fanaticism;
and the father of Amer deplored, in pathetic strains, the apostasy
and damnation of a son, who had renounced the promises of God, and the
intercession of the prophet, to occupy, with the priests and deacons,
the lowest mansions of hell. The more fortunate Arabs, who survived the
war and persevered in the faith, were restrained by their abstemious
leader from the abuse of prosperity. After a refreshment of three days,
Abu Obeidah withdrew his troops from the pernicious contagion of the
luxury of Antioch, and assured the caliph that their religion and virtue
could only be preserved by the hard discipline of poverty and labor. But
the virtue of Omar, however rigorous to himself, was kind and liberal
to his brethren. After a just tribute of praise and thanksgiving, he
dropped a tear of compassion; and sitting down on the ground, wrote
an answer, in which he mildly censured the severity of his lieutenant:
"God," said the successor of the prophet, "has not forbidden the use of
the good things of this worl to faithful men, and such as have performed
good works. Therefore you ought to have given them leave to rest
themselves, and partake freely of those good things which the country
affordeth. If any of the Saracens have no family in Arabia, they may
marry in Syria; and whosoever of them wants any female slaves, he may
purchase as many as he hath occasion for." The conquerors prepared
to use, or to abuse, this gracious permission; but the year of their
triumph was marked by a mortality of men and cattle; and twenty-five
thousand Saracens were snatched away from the possession of Syria.
The death of Abu Obeidah might be lamented by the Christians; but his
brethren recollected that he was one of the ten elect whom the prophet
had named as the heirs of paradise. <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a> Caled survived his brethren
about three years: and the tomb of the Sword of God is shown in the
neighborhood of Emesa. His valor, which founded in Arabia and Syria
the empire of the caliphs, was fortified by the opinion of a special
providence; and as long as he wore a cap, which had been blessed
by Mahomet, he deemed himself invulnerable amidst the darts of the
infidels. <a href="#note-9111" name="noteref-9111"><small>9111</small></a>

vary the praises of his disciples. Of Omar he was accustomed to say,

in a general calamity, Omar would be accepted by the divine justice,

90,) after having been deprived of his ample share of the plunder of
Syria by the jealousy of Omar, died, possessed only of his horse, his
arms, and a single slave. Yet Omar was obliged to acknowledge to his
lamenting parent. that never mother had produced a son like Khaled.&mdash;M.]
</p>
<p>
The place of the first conquerors was supplied by a new generation of
their children and countrymen: Syria became the seat and support of
the house of Ommiyah; and the revenue, the soldiers, the ships of that
powerful kingdom were consecrated to enlarge on every side the empire of
the caliphs. But the Saracens despise a superfluity of fame; and their
historians scarcely condescend to mention the subordinate conquests
which are lost in the splendor and rapidity of their victorious career.
</p>
<p>
To the north of Syria, they passed Mount Taurus, and reduced to their
obedience the province of Cilicia, with its capital Tarsus, the ancient
monument of the Assyrian kings. Beyond a second ridge of the same
mountains, they spread the flame of war, rather than the light of
religion, as far as the shores of the Euxine, and the neighborhood of
Constantinople. To the east they advanced to the banks and sources of
the Euphrates and Tigris: <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> the long disputed barrier of Rome and
Persia was forever confounded the walls of Edessa and Amida, of Dara and
Nisibis, which had resisted the arms and engines of Sapor or Nushirvan,
were levelled in the dust; and the holy city of Abgarus might vainly
produce the epistle or the image of Christ to an unbelieving conqueror.
To the west the Syrian kingdom is bounded by the sea: and the ruin of
Aradus, a small island or peninsula on the coast, was postponed during
ten years. But the hills of Libanus abounded in timber; the trade of
Phoenicia was populous in mariners; and a fleet of seventeen hundred
barks was equipped and manned by the natives of the desert. The Imperial
navy of the Romans fled before them from the Pamphylian rocks to the
Hellespont; but the spirit of the emperor, a grandson of Heraclius, had
been subdued before the combat by a dream and a pun. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> The Saracens
rode masters of the sea; and the islands of Cyprus, Rhodes, and the
Cyclades, were successively exposed to their rapacious visits. Three
hundred years before the Christian aera, the memorable though fruitless
siege of Rhodes <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> by Demetrius had furnished that maritime republic
with the materials and the subject of a trophy. A gigantic statue
of Apollo, or the sun, seventy cubits in height, was erected at the
entrance of the harbor, a monument of the freedom and the arts of
Greece. After standing fifty-six years, the colossus of Rhodes was
overthrown by an earthquake; but the massy trunk, and huge fragments,
lay scattered eight centuries on the ground, and are often described
as one of the wonders of the ancient world. They were collected by the
diligence of the Saracens, and sold to a Jewish merchant of Edessa, who
is said to have laden nine hundred camels with the weight of the brass
metal; an enormous weight, though we should include the hundred
colossal figures, <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> and the three thousand statues, which adorned the
prosperity of the city of the sun.

II. The conquest of Egypt may be explained by the character of the
victorious Saracen, one of the first of his nation, in an age when the
meanest of the brethren was exalted above his nature by the spirit of
enthusiasm. The birth of Amrou was at once base and illustrious; his
mother, a notorious prostitute, was unable to decide among five of the
Koreish; but the proof of resemblance adjudged the child to Aasi,
the oldest of her lovers. <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> The youth of Amrou was impelled by the
passions and prejudices of his kindred: his poetic genius was exercised
in satirical verses against the person and doctrine of Mahomet; his
dexterity was employed by the reigning faction to pursue the religious
exiles who had taken refuge in the court of the Aethiopian king. <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a>
Yet he returned from this embassy a secret proselyte; his reason or his
interest determined him to renounce the worship of idols; he escaped
from Mecca with his friend Caled; and the prophet of Medina enjoyed at
the same moment the satisfaction of embracing the two firmest champions
of his cause. The impatience of Amrou to lead the armies of the faithful
was checked by the reproof of Omar, who advised him not to seek
power and dominion, since he who is a subject to-day, may be a prince
to-morrow. Yet his merit was not overlooked by the two first successors
of Mahomet; they were indebted to his arms for the conquest of
Palestine; and in all the battles and sieges of Syria, he united with
the temper of a chief the valor of an adventurous soldier. In a visit
to Medina, the caliph expressed a wish to survey the sword which had cut
down so many Christian warriors; the son of Aasi unsheathed a short and
ordinary cimeter; and as he perceived the surprise of Omar, "Alas," said
the modest Saracen, "the sword itself, without the arm of its master, is
neither sharper nor more weighty than the sword of Pharezdak the poet."
<a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> After the conquest of Egypt, he was recalled by the jealousy of
the caliph Othman; but in the subsequent troubles, the ambition of a
soldier, a statesman, and an orator, emerged from a private station.
His powerful support, both in council and in the field, established the
throne of the Ommiades; the administration and revenue of Egypt were
restored by the gratitude of Moawiyah to a faithful friend who had
raised himself above the rank of a subject; and Amrou ended his days in
the palace and city which he had founded on the banks of the Nile. His
dying speech to his children is celebrated by the Arabians as a model
of eloquence and wisdom: he deplored the errors of his youth but if the
penitent was still infected by the vanity of a poet, he might exaggerate
the venom and mischief of his impious compositions. <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a>

of Tacitus may aptly compare Vespasian and Mucianus with Moawiyah and

characters, of the men.]
</p>
<p>
From his camp in Palestine, Amrou had surprised or anticipated the
caliph's leave for the invasion of Egypt. <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> The magnanimous Omar
trusted in his God and his sword, which had shaken the thrones of
Chosroes and Caesar: but when he compared the slender force of the
Moslems with the greatness of the enterprise, he condemned his own
rashness, and listened to his timid companions. The pride and the
greatness of Pharaoh were familiar to the readers of the Koran; and a
tenfold repetition of prodigies had been scarcely sufficient to effect,
not the victory, but the flight, of six hundred thousand of the
children of Israel: the cities of Egypt were many and populous; their
architecture was strong and solid; the Nile, with its numerous branches,
was alone an insuperable barrier; and the granary of the Imperial city
would be obstinately defended by the Roman powers. In this perplexity,
the commander of the faithful resigned himself to the decision of
chance, or, in his opinion, of Providence. At the head of only four
thousand Arabs, the intrepid Amrou had marched away from his station of
Gaza when he was overtaken by the messenger of Omar. "If you are still
in Syria," said the ambiguous mandate, "retreat without delay; but if,
at the receipt of this epistle, you have already reached the frontiers
of Egypt, advance with confidence, and depend on the succor of God and
of your brethren." The experience, perhaps the secret intelligence,
of Amrou had taught him to suspect the mutability of courts; and he
continued his march till his tents were unquestionably pitched on
Egyptian ground. He there assembled his officers, broke the seal,
perused the epistle, gravely inquired the name and situation of the
place, and declared his ready obedience to the commands of the caliph.
After a siege of thirty days, he took possession of Farmah or Pelusium;
and that key of Egypt, as it has been justly named, unlocked the
entrance of the country as far as the ruins of Heliopolis and the
neighborhood of the modern Cairo.

On the Western side of the Nile, at a small distance to the east of the
Pyramids, at a small distance to the south of the Delta, Memphis, one
hundred and fifty furlongs in circumference, displayed the magnificence
of ancient kings. Under the reign of the Ptolemies and Caesars, the
seat of government was removed to the sea-coast; the ancient capital
was eclipsed by the arts and opulence of Alexandria; the palaces, and
at length the temples, were reduced to a desolate and ruinous condition:
yet, in the age of Augustus, and even in that of Constantine, Memphis
was still numbered among the greatest and most populous of the
provincial cities. <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> The banks of the Nile, in this place of the
breadth of three thousand feet, were united by two bridges of sixty and
of thirty boats, connected in the middle stream by the small island of
Rouda, which was covered with gardens and habitations. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> The eastern
extremity of the bridge was terminated by the town of Babylon and the
camp of a Roman legion, which protected the passage of the river and the
second capital of Egypt. This important fortress, which might fairly be
described as a part of Memphis or Misrah, was invested by the arms of
the lieutenant of Omar: a reenforcement of four thousand Saracens soon
arrived in his camp; and the military engines, which battered the walls,
may be imputed to the art and labor of his Syrian allies. Yet the siege
was protracted to seven months; and the rash invaders were encompassed
and threatened by the inundation of the Nile. <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> Their last assault
was bold and successful: they passed the ditch, which had been fortified
with iron spikes, applied their scaling ladders, entered the fortress
with the shout of "God is victorious!" and drove the remnant of the
Greeks to their boats and the Isle of Rouda. The spot was afterwards
recommended to the conqueror by the easy communication with the gulf and
the peninsula of Arabia; the remains of Memphis were deserted; the tents
of the Arabs were converted into permanent habitations; and the first
mosch was blessed by the presence of fourscore companions of Mahomet.
<a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> A new city arose in their camp, on the eastward bank of the Nile;
and the contiguous quarters of Babylon and Fostat are confounded in
their present decay by the appellation of old Misrah, or Cairo, of
which they form an extensive suburb. But the name of Cairo, the town of
victory, more strictly belongs to the modern capital, which was founded
in the tenth century by the Fatimite caliphs. <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> It has gradually
receded from the river; but the continuity of buildings may be traced
by an attentive eye from the monuments of Sesostris to those of Saladin.

Yet the Arabs, after a glorious and profitable enterprise, must have
retreated to the desert, had they not found a powerful alliance in the
heart of the country. The rapid conquest of Alexander was assisted by
the superstition and revolt of the natives: they abhorred their Persian
oppressors, the disciples of the Magi, who had burnt the temples of
Egypt, and feasted with sacrilegious appetite on the flesh of the god
Apis. <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a> After a period of ten centuries, the same revolution was
renewed by a similar cause; and in the support of an incomprehensible
creed, the zeal of the Coptic Christians was equally ardent. I
have already explained the origin and progress of the Monophysite
controversy, and the persecution of the emperors, which converted a sect
into a nation, and alienated Egypt from their religion and government.
The Saracens were received as the deliverers of the Jacobite church;
and a secret and effectual treaty was opened during the siege of Memphis
between a victorious army and a people of slaves. A rich and noble
Egyptian, of the name of Mokawkas, had dissembled his faith to obtain
the administration of his province: in the disorders of the Persian
war he aspired to independence: the embassy of Mahomet ranked him among
princes; but he declined, with rich gifts and ambiguous compliments, the
proposal of a new religion. <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> The abuse of his trust exposed him to
the resentment of Heraclius: his submission was delayed by arrogance and
fear; and his conscience was prompted by interest to throw himself on
the favor of the nation and the support of the Saracens. In his first
conference with Amrou, he heard without indignation the usual option of
the Koran, the tribute, or the sword. "The Greeks," replied Mokawkas,
"are determined to abide the determination of the sword; but with the
Greeks I desire no communion, either in this world or in the next, and
I abjure forever the Byzantine tyrant, his synod of Chalcedon, and his
Melchite slaves. For myself and my brethren, we are resolved to live
and die in the profession of the gospel and unity of Christ. It is
impossible for us to embrace the revelations of your prophet; but we are
desirous of peace, and cheerfully submit to pay tribute and obedience to
his temporal successors." The tribute was ascertained at two pieces of
gold for the head of every Christian; but old men, monks, women, and
children, of both sexes, under sixteen years of age, were exempted
from this personal assessment: the Copts above and below Memphis swore
allegiance to the caliph, and promised a hospitable entertainment of
three days to every Mussulman who should travel through their country.
By this charter of security, the ecclesiastical and civil tyranny of the
Melchites was destroyed: <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> the anathemas of St. Cyril were thundered
from every pulpit; and the sacred edifices, with the patrimony of the
church, were restored to the national communion of the Jacobites, who
enjoyed without moderation the moment of triumph and revenge. At the
pressing summons of Amrou, their patriarch Benjamin emerged from his
desert; and after the first interview, the courteous Arab affected to
declare that he had never conversed with a Christian priest of more
innocent manners and a more venerable aspect. <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> In the march from
Memphis to Alexandria, the lieutenant of Omar intrusted his safety to
the zeal and gratitude of the Egyptians: the roads and bridges were
diligently repaired; and in every step of his progress, he could depend
on a constant supply of provisions and intelligence. The Greeks of
Egypt, whose numbers could scarcely equal a tenth of the natives, were
overwhelmed by the universal defection: they had ever been hated, they
were no longer feared: the magistrate fled from his tribunal, the bishop
from his altar; and the distant garrisons were surprised or starved by
the surrounding multitudes. Had not the Nile afforded a safe and ready
conveyance to the sea, not an individual could have escaped, who by
birth, or language, or office, or religion, was connected with their
odious name.

Alexandrin. p. 156-172,) who has enriched the conquest of Egypt with
some facts from the Arabic text of Severus the Jacobite historian]
</p>
<p>
By the retreat of the Greeks from the provinces of Upper Egypt, a
considerable force was collected in the Island of Delta; the natural
and artificial channels of the Nile afforded a succession of strong and
defensible posts; and the road to Alexandria was laboriously cleared by
the victory of the Saracens in two-and-twenty days of general or partial
combat. In their annals of conquest, the siege of Alexandria <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a> is
perhaps the most arduous and important enterprise. The first trading
city in the world was abundantly replenished with the means of
subsistence and defence. Her numerous inhabitants fought for the dearest
of human rights, religion and property; and the enmity of the natives
seemed to exclude them from the common benefit of peace and toleration.
The sea was continually open; and if Heraclius had been awake to the
public distress, fresh armies of Romans and Barbarians might have been
poured into the harbor to save the second capital of the empire. A
circumference of ten miles would have scattered the forces of the
Greeks, and favored the stratagems of an active enemy; but the two sides
of an oblong square were covered by the sea and the Lake Maraeotis, and
each of the narrow ends exposed a front of no more than ten furlongs.
The efforts of the Arabs were not inadequate to the difficulty of the
attempt and the value of the prize. From the throne of Medina, the eyes
of Omar were fixed on the camp and city: his voice excited to arms the
Arabian tribes and the veterans of Syria; and the merit of a holy war
was recommended by the peculiar fame and fertility of Egypt. Anxious
for the ruin or expulsion of their tyrants, the faithful natives devoted
their labors to the service of Amrou: some sparks of martial spirit were
perhaps rekindled by the example of their allies; and the sanguine
hopes of Mokawkas had fixed his sepulchre in the church of St. John of
Alexandria. Eutychius the patriarch observes, that the Saracens fought
with the courage of lions: they repulsed the frequent and almost daily
sallies of the besieged, and soon assaulted in their turn the walls and
towers of the city. In every attack, the sword, the banner of Amrou,
glittered in the van of the Moslems. On a memorable day, he was betrayed
by his imprudent valor: his followers who had entered the citadel
were driven back; and the general, with a friend and slave, remained a
prisoner in the hands of the Christians. When Amrou was conducted before
the praefect, he remembered his dignity, and forgot his situation: a
lofty demeanor, and resolute language, revealed the lieutenant of the
caliph, and the battle-axe of a soldier was already raised to strike off
the head of the audacious captive. His life was saved by the readiness
of his slave, who instantly gave his master a blow on the face, and
commanded him, with an angry tone, to be silent in the presence of his
superiors. The credulous Greek was deceived: he listened to the offer
of a treaty, and his prisoners were dismissed in the hope of a more
respectable embassy, till the joyful acclamations of the camp announced
the return of their general, and insulted the folly of the infidels.
At length, after a siege of fourteen months, <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> and the loss of
three-and-twenty thousand men, the Saracens prevailed: the Greeks
embarked their dispirited and diminished numbers, and the standard
of Mahomet was planted on the walls of the capital of Egypt. "I have
taken," said Amrou to the caliph, "the great city of the West. It is
impossible for me to enumerate the variety of its riches and beauty; and
I shall content myself with observing, that it contains four thousand
palaces, four thousand baths, four hundred theatres or places of
amusement, twelve thousand shops for the sale of vegetable food, and
forty thousand tributary Jews. The town has been subdued by force of
arms, without treaty or capitulation, and the Moslems are impatient to
seize the fruits of their victory." <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> The commander of the faithful
rejected with firmness the idea of pillage, and directed his lieutenant
to reserve the wealth and revenue of Alexandria for the public service
and the propagation of the faith: the inhabitants were numbered; a
tribute was imposed, the zeal and resentment of the Jacobites were
curbed, and the Melchites who submitted to the Arabian yoke were
indulged in the obscure but tranquil exercise of their worship. The
intelligence of this disgraceful and calamitous event afflicted the
declining health of the emperor; and Heraclius died of a dropsy about
seven weeks after the loss of Alexandria. <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> Under the minority
of his grandson, the clamors of a people, deprived of their daily
sustenance, compelled the Byzantine court to undertake the recovery
of the capital of Egypt. In the space of four years, the harbor and
fortifications of Alexandria were twice occupied by a fleet and army of
Romans. They were twice expelled by the valor of Amrou, who was recalled
by the domestic peril from the distant wars of Tripoli and Nubia. But
the facility of the attempt, the repetition of the insult, and the
obstinacy of the resistance, provoked him to swear, that if a third
time he drove the infidels into the sea, he would render Alexandria as
accessible on all sides as the house of a prostitute. Faithful to his
promise, he dismantled several parts of the walls and towers; but the
people was spared in the chastisement of the city, and the mosch of
Mercy was erected on the spot where the victorious general had stopped
the fury of his troops.

    Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.&mdash;Part VI.
</h2>
<p>
I should deceive the expectation of the reader, if I passed in silence
the fate of the Alexandrian library, as it is described by the learned
Abulpharagius. The spirit of Amrou was more curious and liberal than
that of his brethren, and in his leisure hours, the Arabian chief was
pleased with the conversation of John, the last disciple of Ammonius,
and who derived the surname of Philoponus from his laborious studies of
grammar and philosophy. <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> Emboldened by this familiar intercourse,
Philoponus presumed to solicit a gift, inestimable in his opinion,
contemptible in that of the Barbarians&mdash;the royal library, which alone,
among the spoils of Alexandria, had not been appropriated by the visit
and the seal of the conqueror.
</p>
<p>
Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian, but his rigid
integrity refused to alienate the minutest object without the consent
of the caliph; and the well-known answer of Omar was inspired by the
ignorance of a fanatic. "If these writings of the Greeks agree with
the book of God, they are useless, and need not be preserved: if they
disagree, they are pernicious, and ought to be destroyed." The sentence
was executed with blind obedience: the volumes of paper or parchment
were distributed to the four thousand baths of the city; and such was
their incredible multitude, that six months were barely sufficient
for the consumption of this precious fuel. Since the Dynasties of
Abulpharagius <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> have been given to the world in a Latin version,
the tale has been repeatedly transcribed; and every scholar, with pious
indignation, has deplored the irreparable shipwreck of the learning,
the arts, and the genius, of antiquity. For my own part, I am strongly
tempted to deny both the fact and the consequences. <a href="#note-1161" name="noteref-1161"><small>1161</small></a> The fact is
indeed marvellous. "Read and wonder!" says the historian himself: and
the solitary report of a stranger who wrote at the end of six hundred
years on the confines of Media, is overbalanced by the silence of two
annalist of a more early date, both Christians, both natives of Egypt,
and the most ancient of whom, the patriarch Eutychius, has amply
described the conquest of Alexandria. <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> The rigid sentence of Omar
is repugnant to the sound and orthodox precept of the Mahometan casuists
they expressly declare, that the religious books of the Jews and
Christians, which are acquired by the right of war, should never
be committed to the flames; and that the works of profane science,
historians or poets, physicians or philosophers, may be lawfully applied
to the use of the faithful. <a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a> A more destructive zeal may perhaps be
attributed to the first successors of Mahomet; yet in this instance,
the conflagration would have speedily expired in the deficiency of
materials. I should not recapitulate the disasters of the Alexandrian
library, the involuntary flame that was kindled by Caesar in his own
defence, <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a> or the mischievous bigotry of the Christians, who studied
to destroy the monuments of idolatry. <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> But if we gradually descend
from the age of the Antonines to that of Theodosius, we shall learn from
a chain of contemporary witnesses, that the royal palace and the temple
of Serapis no longer contained the four, or the seven, hundred thousand
volumes, which had been assembled by the curiosity and magnificence of
the Ptolemies. <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a> Perhaps the church and seat of the patriarchs might
be enriched with a repository of books; but if the ponderous mass of
Arian and Monophysite controversy were indeed consumed in the public
baths, <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> a philosopher may allow, with a smile, that it was
ultimately devoted to the benefit of mankind. I sincerely regret the
more valuable libraries which have been involved in the ruin of the
Roman empire; but when I seriously compute the lapse of ages, the waste
of ignorance, and the calamities of war, our treasures, rather than our
losses, are the objects of my surprise. Many curious and interesting
facts are buried in oblivion: the three great historians of Rome have
been transmitted to our hands in a mutilated state, and we are deprived
of many pleasing compositions of the lyric, iambic, and dramatic poetry
of the Greeks. Yet we should gratefully remember, that the mischances of
time and accident have spared the classic works to which the suffrage
of antiquity <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a> had adjudged the first place of genius and glory:
the teachers of ancient knowledge, who are still extant, had perused and
compared the writings of their predecessors; <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a> nor can it fairly
be presumed that any important truth, any useful discovery in art or
nature, has been snatched away from the curiosity of modern ages.

In the administration of Egypt, <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a> Amrou balanced the demands of
justice and policy; the interest of the people of the law, who were
defended by God; and of the people of the alliance, who were protected
by man. In the recent tumult of conquest and deliverance, the tongue
of the Copts and the sword of the Arabs were most adverse to the
tranquillity of the province. To the former, Amrou declared, that
faction and falsehood would be doubly chastised; by the punishment of
the accusers, whom he should detest as his personal enemies, and by the
promotion of their innocent brethren, whom their envy had labored to
injure and supplant. He excited the latter by the motives of religion
and honor to sustain the dignity of their character, to endear
themselves by a modest and temperate conduct to God and the caliph,
to spare and protect a people who had trusted to their faith, and to
content themselves with the legitimate and splendid rewards of their
victory. In the management of the revenue, he disapproved the simple but
oppressive mode of a capitation, and preferred with reason a proportion
of taxes deducted on every branch from the clear profits of agriculture
and commerce. A third part of the tribute was appropriated to the annual
repairs of the dikes and canals, so essential to the public welfare.
Under his administration, the fertility of Egypt supplied the dearth of
Arabia; and a string of camels, laden with corn and provisions, covered
almost without an interval the long road from Memphis to Medina. <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a>
But the genius of Amrou soon renewed the maritime communication which
had been attempted or achieved by the Pharaohs the Ptolemies, or the
Caesars; and a canal, at least eighty miles in length, was opened from
the Nile to the Red Sea. <a href="#note-1261" name="noteref-1261"><small>1261</small></a> This inland navigation, which would have
joined the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, was soon discontinued as
useless and dangerous: the throne was removed from Medina to Damascus,

(alveus navigabilis.) The indications furnished by Ptolemy and by the

Of his new conquest, the caliph Omar had an imperfect knowledge from
the voice of fame and the legends of the Koran. He requested that his
lieutenant would place before his eyes the realm of Pharaoh and the
Amalekites; and the answer of Amrou exhibits a lively and not unfaithful
picture of that singular country. <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> "O commander of the faithful,
Egypt is a compound of black earth and green plants, between a
pulverized mountain and a red sand. The distance from Syene to the sea
is a month's journey for a horseman. Along the valley descends a river,
on which the blessing of the Most High reposes both in the evening and
morning, and which rises and falls with the revolutions of the sun and
moon. When the annual dispensation of Providence unlocks the springs
and fountains that nourish the earth, the Nile rolls his swelling and
sounding waters through the realm of Egypt: the fields are overspread
by the salutary flood; and the villages communicate with each other
in their painted barks. The retreat of the inundation deposits a
fertilizing mud for the reception of the various seeds: the crowds
of husbandmen who blacken the land may be compared to a swarm of
industrious ants; and their native indolence is quickened by the lash
of the task-master, and the promise of the flowers and fruits of a
plentiful increase. Their hope is seldom deceived; but the riches which
they extract from the wheat, the barley, and the rice, the legumes,
the fruit-trees, and the cattle, are unequally shared between those
who labor and those who possess. According to the vicissitudes of
the seasons, the face of the country is adorned with a silver wave, a
verdant emerald, and the deep yellow of a golden harvest." <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a> Yet
this beneficial order is sometimes interrupted; and the long delay and
sudden swell of the river in the first year of the conquest might afford
some color to an edifying fable. It is said, that the annual sacrifice
of a virgin <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> had been interdicted by the piety of Omar; and that
the Nile lay sullen and inactive in his shallow bed, till the mandate
of the caliph was cast into the obedient stream, which rose in a single
night to the height of sixteen cubits. The admiration of the Arabs for
their new conquest encouraged the license of their romantic spirit. We
may read, in the gravest authors, that Egypt was crowded with twenty
thousand cities or villages: <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a> that, exclusive of the Greeks and
Arabs, the Copts alone were found, on the assessment, six millions of
tributary subjects, <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a> or twenty millions of either sex, and of every
age: that three hundred millions of gold or silver were annually paid to
the treasury of the caliphs. <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> Our reason must be startled by these
extravagant assertions; and they will become more palpable, if we assume
the compass and measure the extent of habitable ground: a valley from
the tropic to Memphis seldom broader than twelve miles, and the triangle
of the Delta, a flat surface of two thousand one hundred square leagues,
compose a twelfth part of the magnitude of France. <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a> A more accurate
research will justify a more reasonable estimate. The three hundred
millions, created by the error of a scribe, are reduced to the decent
revenue of four millions three hundred thousand pieces of gold, of which
nine hundred thousand were consumed by the pay of the soldiers. <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a>

IV. The conquest of Africa, from the Nile to the Atlantic Ocean, <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a>
was first attempted by the arms of the caliph Othman.
</p>
<p>
The pious design was approved by the companions of Mahomet and the
chiefs of the tribes; and twenty thousand Arabs marched from Medina,
with the gifts and the blessing of the commander of the faithful.
They were joined in the camp of Memphis by twenty thousand of their
countrymen; and the conduct of the war was intrusted to Abdallah, <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a>
the son of Said and the foster-brother of the caliph, who had lately
supplanted the conqueror and lieutenant of Egypt. Yet the favor of the
prince, and the merit of his favorite, could not obliterate the guilt of
his apostasy. The early conversion of Abdallah, and his skilful pen, had
recommended him to the important office of transcribing the sheets of
the Koran: he betrayed his trust, corrupted the text, derided the errors
which he had made, and fled to Mecca to escape the justice, and expose
the ignorance, of the apostle. After the conquest of Mecca, he fell
prostrate at the feet of Mahomet; his tears, and the entreaties of
Othman, extorted a reluctant pardon; out the prophet declared that he
had so long hesitated, to allow time for some zealous disciple to avenge
his injury in the blood of the apostate. With apparent fidelity and
effective merit, he served the religion which it was no longer his
interest to desert: his birth and talents gave him an honorable rank
among the Koreish; and, in a nation of cavalry, Abdallah was renowned as
the boldest and most dexterous horseman of Arabia. At the head of forty
thousand Moslems, he advanced from Egypt into the unknown countries of
the West. The sands of Barca might be impervious to a Roman legion but
the Arabs were attended by their faithful camels; and the natives of
the desert beheld without terror the familiar aspect of the soil and
climate. After a painful march, they pitched their tents before the
walls of Tripoli, <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a> a maritime city in which the name, the wealth,
and the inhabitants of the province had gradually centred, and which now
maintains the third rank among the states of Barbary. A reenforcement
of Greeks was surprised and cut in pieces on the sea-shore; but the
fortifications of Tripoli resisted the first assaults; and the Saracens
were tempted by the approach of the praefect Gregory <a href="#note-141" name="noteref-141"><small>141</small></a> to relinquish
the labors of the siege for the perils and the hopes of a decisive
action. If his standard was followed by one hundred and twenty thousand
men, the regular bands of the empire must have been lost in the naked
and disorderly crowd of Africans and Moors, who formed the strength, or
rather the numbers, of his host. He rejected with indignation the option
of the Koran or the tribute; and during several days the two armies were
fiercely engaged from the dawn of light to the hour of noon, when
their fatigue and the excessive heat compelled them to seek shelter and
refreshment in their respective camps. The daughter of Gregory, a maid
of incomparable beauty and spirit, is said to have fought by his side:
from her earliest youth she was trained to mount on horseback, to draw
the bow, and to wield the cimeter; and the richness of her arms and
apparel were conspicuous in the foremost ranks of the battle. Her hand,
with a hundred thousand pieces of gold, was offered for the head of the
Arabian general, and the youths of Africa were excited by the prospect
of the glorious prize. At the pressing solicitation of his brethren,
Abdallah withdrew his person from the field; but the Saracens were
discouraged by the retreat of their leader, and the repetition of these
equal or unsuccessful conflicts.

</p>
<p>
A noble Arabian, who afterwards became the adversary of Ali, and the
father of a caliph, had signalized his valor in Egypt, and Zobeir
<a href="#note-142" name="noteref-142"><small>142</small></a> was the first who planted the scaling-ladder against the walls
of Babylon. In the African war he was detached from the standard of
Abdallah. On the news of the battle, Zobeir, with twelve companions, cut
his way through the camp of the Greeks, and pressed forwards, without
tasting either food or repose, to partake of the dangers of his
brethren. He cast his eyes round the field: "Where," said he, "is our
general?" "In his tent." "Is the tent a station for the general of the
Moslems?" Abdallah represented with a blush the importance of his own
life, and the temptation that was held forth by the Roman praefect.
"Retort," said Zobeir, "on the infidels their ungenerous attempt.
Proclaim through the ranks that the head of Gregory shall be repaid with
his captive daughter, and the equal sum of one hundred thousand pieces
of gold." To the courage and discretion of Zobeir the lieutenant of the
caliph intrusted the execution of his own stratagem, which inclined the
long-disputed balance in favor of the Saracens. Supplying by activity
and artifice the deficiency of numbers, a part of their forces lay
concealed in their tents, while the remainder prolonged an irregular
skirmish with the enemy till the sun was high in the heavens. On both
sides they retired with fainting steps: their horses were unbridled,
their armor was laid aside, and the hostile nations prepared, or seemed
to prepare, for the refreshment of the evening, and the encounter of the
ensuing day. On a sudden the charge was sounded; the Arabian camp poured
forth a swarm of fresh and intrepid warriors; and the long line of
the Greeks and Africans was surprised, assaulted, overturned, by new
squadrons of the faithful, who, to the eye of fanaticism, might appear
as a band of angels descending from the sky. The praefect himself was
slain by the hand of Zobeir: his daughter, who sought revenge and death,
was surrounded and made prisoner; and the fugitives involved in their
disaster the town of Sufetula, to which they escaped from the sabres and
lances of the Arabs. Sufetula was built one hundred and fifty miles
to the south of Carthage: a gentle declivity is watered by a running
stream, and shaded by a grove of juniper-trees; and, in the ruins of
a triumpha arch, a portico, and three temples of the Corinthian order,
curiosity may yet admire the magnificence of the Romans. <a href="#note-143" name="noteref-143"><small>143</small></a> After the
fall of this opulent city, the provincials and Barbarians implored on
all sides the mercy of the conqueror. His vanity or his zeal might be
flattered by offers of tribute or professions of faith: but his losses,
his fatigues, and the progress of an epidemical disease, prevented
a solid establishment; and the Saracens, after a campaign of fifteen
months, retreated to the confines of Egypt, with the captives and the
wealth of their African expedition. The caliph's fifth was granted to
a favorite, on the nominal payment of five hundred thousand pieces
of gold; <a href="#note-144" name="noteref-144"><small>144</small></a> but the state was doubly injured by this fallacious
transaction, if each foot-soldier had shared one thousand, and each
horseman three thousand, pieces, in the real division of the plunder.
The author of the death of Gregory was expected to have claimed the most
precious reward of the victory: from his silence it might be presumed
that he had fallen in the battle, till the tears and exclamations of
the praefect's daughter at the sight of Zobeir revealed the valor and
modesty of that gallant soldier. The unfortunate virgin was offered,
and almost rejected as a slave, by her father's murderer, who coolly
declared that his sword was consecrated to the service of religion; and
that he labored for a recompense far above the charms of mortal beauty,
or the riches of this transitory life. A reward congenial to his temper
was the honorable commission of announcing to the caliph Othman the
success of his arms. The companions the chiefs, and the people, were
assembled in the mosch of Medina, to hear the interesting narrative of
Zobeir; and as the orator forgot nothing except the merit of his own
counsels and actions, the name of Abdallah was joined by the Arabians
with the heroic names of Caled and Amrou. <a href="#note-145" name="noteref-145"><small>145</small></a>

[A. D. 665-689.] The western conquests of the Saracens were suspended
near twenty years, till their dissensions were composed by the
establishment of the house of Ommiyah; and the caliph Moawiyah was
invited by the cries of the Africans themselves. The successors of
Heraclius had been informed of the tribute which they had been compelled
to stipulate with the Arabs; but instead of being moved to pity and
relieve their distress, they imposed, as an equivalent or a fine, a
second tribute of a similar amount. The ears of the zantine ministers
were shut against the complaints of their poverty and ruin their
despair was reduced to prefer the dominion of a single master; and the
extortions of the patriarch of Carthage, who was invested with civil and
military power, provoked the sectaries, and even the Catholics, of the
Roman province to abjure the religion as well as the authority of
their tyrants. The first lieutenant of Moawiyah acquired a just renown,
subdued an important city, defeated an army of thirty thousand Greeks,
swept away fourscore thousand captives, and enriched with their spoils
the bold adventurers of Syria and Egypt.<a href="#note-146" name="noteref-146"><small>146</small></a> But the title of conqueror
of Africa is more justly due to his successor Akbah. He marched from
Damascus at the head of ten thousand of the bravest Arabs; and the
genuine force of the Moslems was enlarged by the doubtful aid and
conversion of many thousand Barbarians. It would be difficult, nor is
it necessary, to trace the accurate line of the progress of Akbah. The
interior regions have been peopled by the Orientals with fictitious
armies and imaginary citadels. In the warlike province of Zab or
Numidia, fourscore thousand of the natives might assemble in arms; but
the number of three hundred and sixty towns is incompatible with the
ignorance or decay of husbandry;<a href="#note-147" name="noteref-147"><small>147</small></a> and a circumference of three
leagues will not be justified by the ruins of Erbe or Lambesa, the
ancient metropolis of that inland country. As we approach the seacoast,
the well-known titles of Bugia,<a href="#note-148" name="noteref-148"><small>148</small></a> and Tangier<a href="#note-149" name="noteref-149"><small>149</small></a> define the more
certain limits of the Saracen victories. A remnant of trade still
adheres to the commodious harbour of Bugia, which, in a more prosperous
age, is said to have contained about twenty thousand houses; and the
plenty of iron which is dug from the adjacent mountains might have
supplied a braver people with the instruments of defence. The remote
position and venerable antiquity of Tingi, or Tangier, have been
decorated by the Greek and Arabian fables; but the figurative
expressions of the latter, that the walls were constructed of brass, and
that the roofs were covered with gold and silver, may be interpreted as
the emblems of strength and opulence.

The province of Mauritania Tingitana,<a href="#note-150" name="noteref-150"><small>150</small></a> which assumed the name of the
capital had been imperfectly discovered and settled by the Romans; the
five colonies were confined to a narrow pale, and the more southern
parts were seldom explored except by the agents of luxury, who searched
the forests for ivory and the citron wood,<a href="#note-151" name="noteref-151"><small>151</small></a> and the shores of the
ocean for the purple shellfish. The fearless Akbah plunged into the
heart of the country, traversed the wilderness in which his successors
erected the splendid capitals of Fez and Morocco,<a href="#note-152" name="noteref-152"><small>152</small></a> and at length
penetrated to the verge of the Atlantic and the great desert. The river
Suz descends from the western sides of mount Atlas, fertilizes, like the
Nile, the adjacent soil, and falls into the sea at a moderate distance
from the Canary, or adjacent islands. Its banks were inhabited by the
last of the Moors, a race of savages, without laws, or discipline, or
religion: they were astonished by the strange and irresistible terrors
of the Oriental arms; and as they possessed neither gold nor silver, the
richest spoil was the beauty of the female captives, some of whom were
afterward sold for a thousand pieces of gold. The career, though not
the zeal, of Akbah was checked by the prospect of a boundless ocean.
He spurred his horse into the waves, and raising his eyes to heaven,
exclaimed with the tone of a fanatic: "Great God! if my course were not
stopped by this sea, I would still go on, to the unknown kingdoms of the
West, preaching the unity of thy holy name, and putting to the sword the
rebellious nations who worship another gods than thee." <a href="#note-153" name="noteref-153"><small>153</small></a> Yet this
Mahometan Alexander, who sighed for new worlds, was unable to preserve
his recent conquests. By the universal defection of the Greeks and
Africans he was recalled from the shores of the Atlantic, and the
surrounding multitudes left him only the resource of an honourable
death. The last scene was dignified by an example of national virtue. An
ambitious chief, who had disputed the command and failed in the attempt,
was led about as a prisoner in the camp of the Arabian general. The
insurgents had trusted to his discontent and revenge; he disdained their
offers and revealed their designs. In the hour of danger, the grateful
Akbah unlocked his fetters, and advised him to retire; he chose to die
under the banner of his rival. Embracing as friends and martyrs, they
unsheathed their scimeters, broke their scabbards, and maintained an
obstinate combat, till they fell by each other's side on the last of
their slaughtered countrymen. The third general or governor of Africa,
Zuheir, avenged and encountered the fate of his predecessor. He
vanquished the natives in many battles; he was overthrown by a powerful
army, which Constantinople had sent to the relief of Carthage.

to join the invaders, to share the plunder, to profess the faith, and to
revolt in their savage state of independence and idolatry, on the first
retreat or misfortune of the Moslems. The prudence of Akbah had proposed
to found an Arabian colony in the heart of Africa; a citadel that might
curb the levity of the Barbarians, a place of refuge to secure, against
the accidents of war, the wealth and the families of the Saracens. With
this view, and under the modest title of the station of a caravan, he
planted this colony in the fiftieth year of the Hegira. In its present
decay, Cairoan<a href="#note-154" name="noteref-154"><small>154</small></a> still holds the second rank in the kingdom of Tunis,
from which it is distant about fifty miles to the south;<a href="#note-155" name="noteref-155"><small>155</small></a> its inland
situation, twelve miles westward of the sea, has protected the city from
the Greek and Sicilian fleets. When the wild beasts and serpents were
extirpated, when the forest, or rather wilderness, was cleared, the
vestiges of a Roman town were discovered in a sandy plain: the vegetable
food of Cairoan is brought from afar; and the scarcity of springs
constrains the inhabitants to collect in cisterns and reservoirs a
precarious supply of rain water. These obstacles were subdued by the
industry of Akbah; he traced a circumference of three thousand and six
hundred paces, which he encompassed with a brick wall; in the space
of five years, the governor's palace was surrounded with a sufficient
number of private habitations; a spacious mosque was supported by five
hundred columns of granite, porphyry, and Numidian marble; and Cairoan
became the seat of learning as well as of empire. But these were the
glories of a later age; the new colony was shaken by the successive
defeats of Akbah and Zuheir, and the western expeditions were again
interrupted by the civil discord of the Arabian monarchy. The son of the
valiant Zobeir maintained a war of twelve years, a siege of seven months
against the house of Ommiyah. Abdallah was said to unite the fierceness
of the lion with the subtlety of the fox; but if he inherited the
courage, he was devoid of the generosity, of his father.<a href="#note-156" name="noteref-156"><small>156</small></a>

[A. D. 692-698.] The return of domestic peace allowed the caliph
Abdalmalek to resume the conquest of Africa; the standard was delivered
to Hassan governor of Egypt, and the revenue of that kingdom, with an
army of forty thousand men, was consecrated to the important service. In
the vicissitudes of war, the interior provinces had been alternately won
and lost by the Saracens. But the seacoast still remained in the hands
of the Greeks; the predecessors of Hassan had respected the name
and fortifications of Carthage; and the number of its defenders was
recruited by the fugitives of Cabes and Tripoli. The arms of Hassan were
bolder and more fortunate: he reduced and pillaged the metropolis of
Africa; and the mention of scaling-ladders may justify the suspicion,
that he anticipated, by a sudden assault, the more tedious operations of
a regular siege. But the joy of the conquerors was soon disturbed by the
appearance of the Christian succours. The praefect and patrician John, a
general of experience and renown, embarked at Constantinople the forces
of the Eastern empire;<a href="#note-157" name="noteref-157"><small>157</small></a> they were joined by the ships and soldiers
of Sicily, and a powerful reinforcement of Goths<a href="#note-158" name="noteref-158"><small>158</small></a> was obtained from
the fears and religion of the Spanish monarch.

The weight of the confederate navy broke the chain that guarded the
entrance of the harbour; the Arabs retired to Cairoan, or Tripoli; the
Christians landed; the citizens hailed the ensign of the cross, and
the winter was idly wasted in the dream of victory or deliverance. But
Africa was irrecoverably lost: the zeal and resentment of the commander
of the faithful<a href="#note-159" name="noteref-159"><small>159</small></a> prepared in the ensuing spring a more numerous
armament by sea and land; and the patrician in his turn was compelled
to evacuate the post and fortifications of Carthage. A second battle
was fought in the neighbourhood of Utica; and the Greeks and Goths were
again defeated; and their timely embarkation saved them from the sword
of Hassan, who had invested the slight and insufficient rampart of their
camp. Whatever yet remained of Carthage was delivered to the flames, and
the colony of Dido<a href="#note-160" name="noteref-160"><small>160</small></a> and Cesar lay desolate above two hundred years,
till a part, perhaps a twentieth, of the old circumference was repeopled
by the first of the Fatimite caliphs. In the beginning of the sixteenth
century, the second capital of the West was represented by a mosque, a
college without students, twenty-five or thirty shops, and the huts
of five hundred peasants, who, in their abject poverty, displayed the
arrogance of the Punic senators. Even that paltry village was swept away
by the Spaniards whom Charles the Fifth had stationed in the fortress of
the Goletta. The ruins of Carthage have perished; and the place might be
unknown if some broken arches of an aqueduct did not guide the footsteps

[A. D. 698-709.] The Greeks were expelled, but the Arabians were not
yet masters of the country. In the interior provinces the Moors or
Berbers,<a href="#note-162" name="noteref-162"><small>162</small></a> so feeble under the first Cesars, so formidable to the
Byzantine princes, maintained a disorderly resistance to the religion
and power of the successors of Mahomet. Under the standard of their
queen Cahina, the independent tribes acquired some degree of union and
discipline; and as the Moors respected in their females the character of
a prophetess, they attacked the invaders with an enthusiasm similar to
their own. The veteran bands of Hassan were inadequate to the defence
of Africa: the conquests of an age were lost in a single day; and the
Arabian chief, overwhelmed by the torrent, retired to the confines of
Egypt, and expected, five years, the promised succours of the caliph.
After the retreat of the Saracens, the victorious prophetess assembled
the Moorish chiefs, and recommended a measure of strange and savage
policy. "Our cities," said she, "and the gold and silver which they
contain, perpetually attract the arms of the Arabs. These vile metals
are not the objects of OUR ambition; we content ourselves with the
simple productions of the earth. Let us destroy these cities; let us
bury in their ruins those pernicious treasures; and when the avarice of
our foes shall be destitute of temptation, perhaps they will cease to
disturb the tranquillity of a warlike people." The proposal was accepted
with unanimous applause. From Tangier to Tripoli the buildings, or at
least the fortifications, were demolished, the fruit-trees were cut
down, the means of subsistence were extirpated, a fertile and populous
garden was changed into a desert, and the historians of a more
recent period could discern the frequent traces of the prosperity and
devastation of their ancestors.

[ The history of the word Barbar may be classed under four
periods, 1. In the time of Homer, when the Greeks and Asiatics might
probably use a common idiom, the imitative sound of Barbar was applied
to the ruder tribes, whose pronunciation was most harsh, whose grammar
was most defective. 2. From the time, at least, of Herodotus, it was
extended to all the nations who were strangers to the language and
manners of the Greeks. 3. In the age, of Plautus, the Romans submitted
to the insult (Pompeius Festus, l. ii. p. 48, edit. Dacier), and freely
gave themselves the name of Barbarians. They insensibly claimed an
exemption for Italy, and her subject provinces; and at length removed
the disgraceful appellation to the savage or hostile nations beyond
the pale of the empire. 4. In every sense, it was due to the Moors; the
familiar word was borrowed from the Latin Provincials by the Arabian
conquerors, and has justly settled as a local denomination (Barbary)
along the northern coast of Africa.]
</p>
<p>
Such is the tale of the modern Arabians. Yet I strongly suspect that
their ignorance of antiquity, the love of the marvellous, and the
fashion of extolling the philosophy of Barbarians, has induced them to
describe, as one voluntary act, the calamities of three hundred years
since the first fury of the Donatists and Vandals. In the progress
of the revolt, Cahina had most probably contributed her share of
destruction; and the alarm of universal ruin might terrify and alienate
the cities that had reluctantly yielded to her unworthy yoke. They
no longer hoped, perhaps they no longer wished, the return of their
Byzantine sovereigns: their present servitude was not alleviated by the
benefits of order and justice; and the most zealous Catholic must prefer
the imperfect truths of the Koran to the blind and rude idolatry of the
Moors. The general of the Saracens was again received as the saviour of
the province; the friends of civil society conspired against the savages
of the land; and the royal prophetess was slain in the first battle
which overturned the baseless fabric of her superstition and empire.
The same spirit revived under the successor of Hassan; it was finally
quelled by the activity of Musa and his two sons; but the number of the
rebels may be presumed from that of three hundred thousand captives;
sixty thousand of whom, the caliph's fifth, were sold for the profit
of thee public treasury. Thirty thousand of the Barbarian youth were
enlisted in the troops; and the pious labours of Musa to inculcate the
knowledge and practice of the Koran, accustomed the Africans to obey the
apostle of God and the commander of the faithful. In their climate and
government, their diet and habitation, the wandering Moors resembled the
Bedoweens of the desert. With the religion, they were proud to adopt
the language, name, and origin of Arabs: the blood of the strangers and
natives was insensibly mingled; and from the Euphrates to the Atlantic
the same nation might seem to be diffused over the sandy plains of
Asia and Africa. Yet I will not deny that fifty thousand tents of pure
Arabians might be transported over the Nile, and scattered through the
Lybian desert: and I am not ignorant that five of the Moorish tribes
still retain their barbarous idiom, with the appellation and character
of white Africans.<a href="#note-163" name="noteref-163"><small>163</small></a>

[A. D. 709.] V. In the progress of conquest from the north and south,
the Goths and the Saracens encountered each other on the confines of
Europe and Africa. In the opinion of the latter, the difference of
religion is a reasonable ground of enmity and warfare.<a href="#note-164" name="noteref-164"><small>164</small></a> As early as

Gothic succours. In that age, as well as in the present, the kings of
Spain were possessed of the fortress of Ceuta; one of the columns of
Hercules, which is divided by a narrow strait from the opposite pillar
or point of Europe. A small portion of Mauritania was still wanting to
the African conquest; but Musa, in the pride of victory, was repulsed
from the walls of Ceuta, by the vigilance and courage of count Julian,
the general of the Goths. From his disappointment and perplexity,
Musa was relieved by an unexpected message of the Christian chief,
who offered his place, his person, and his sword, to the successors of
Mahomet, and solicited the disgraceful honour of introducing their arms
into the heart of Spain.<a href="#note-167" name="noteref-167"><small>167</small></a>

If we inquire into the cause of this treachery, the Spaniards will

seduced, or ravished, by her sovereign; of a father who sacrificed his
religion and country to the thirst of revenge. The passions of princes
have often been licentious and destructive; but this well-known tale,
romantic in itself, is indifferently supported by external evidence; and
the history of Spain will suggest some motives of interest and policy
more congenial to the breast of a veteran statesman.<a href="#note-169" name="noteref-169"><small>169</small></a> After the
decease or deposition of Witiza, his two sons were supplanted by the
ambition of Roderic, a noble Goth, whose father, the duke or governor of
a province, had fallen a victim to the preceding tyranny. The monarchy
was still elective; but the sons of Witiza, educated on the steps of the
throne, were impatient of a private station. Their resentment was the
more dangerous, as it was varnished with the dissimulation of courts:
their followers were excited by the remembrance of favours and the
promise of a revolution: and their uncle Oppas, archbishop of Toledo
and Seville, was the first person in the church, and the second in the
state. It is probable that Julian was involved in the disgrace of the
unsuccessful faction, that he had little to hope and much to fear from
the new reign; and that the imprudent king could not forget or forgive
the injuries which Roderic and his family had sustained. The merit and
influence of the count rendered him a useful or formidable subject:
his estates were ample, his followers bold and numerous, and it was too
fatally shown that, by his Andalusian and Mauritanian commands, he held
in his hands the keys of the Spanish monarchy. Too feeble, however, to
meet his sovereign in arms, he sought the aid of a foreign power; and
his rash invitation of the Moors and Arabs produced the calamities of
eight hundred years. In his epistles, or in a personal interview, he
revealed the wealth and nakedness of his country; the weakness of an
unpopular prince; the degeneracy of an effeminate people. The Goths were
no longer the victorious Barbarians, who had humbled the pride of Rome,
despoiled the queen of nations, and penetrated from the Danube to the
Atlantic ocean. Secluded from the world by the Pyrenean mountains, the
successors of Alaric had slumbered in a long peace: the walls of the
city were mouldered into dust: the youth had abandoned the exercise of
arms; and the presumption of their ancient renown would expose them in
a field of battle to the first assault of the invaders. The ambitious
Saracen was fired by the ease and importance of the attempt; but
the execution was delayed till he had consulted the commander of the
faithful; and his messenger returned with the permission of Walid to
annex the unknown kingdoms of the West to the religion and throne of the
caliphs. In his residence of Tangier, Musa, with secrecy and caution,
continued his correspondence and hastened his preparations. But the
remorse of the conspirators was soothed by the fallacious assurance that
he should content himself with the glory and spoil, without aspiring
to establish the Moslems beyond the sea that separates Africa from
Europe.<a href="#note-170" name="noteref-170"><small>170</small></a>

[A. D. 710.] Before Musa would trust an army of the faithful to the
traitors and infidels of a foreign land, he made a less dangerous trial
of their strength and veracity. One hundred Arabs and four hundred
Africans, passed over, in four vessels, from Tangier or Ceuta; the place
of their descent on the opposite shore of the strait, is marked by the
name of Tarif their chief; and the date of this memorable event<a href="#note-171" name="noteref-171"><small>171</small></a> is
fixed to the month of Ramandan, of the ninety-first year of the Hegira,
to the month of July, seven hundred and forty-eight years from the
Spanish era of Cesar,<a href="#note-172" name="noteref-172"><small>172</small></a> seven hundred and ten after the birth of
Christ. From their first station, they marched eighteen miles through
a hilly country to the castle and town of Julian;<a href="#note-173" name="noteref-173"><small>173</small></a> on which (it is
still called Algezire) they bestowed the name of the Green Island,
from a verdant cape that advances into the sea. Their hospitable
entertainment, the Christians who joined their standard, their inroad
into a fertile and unguarded province, the richness of their spoil
and the safety of their return, announced to their brethren the most
favourable omens of victory. In the ensuing spring, five thousand
veterans and volunteers were embarked under the command of Tarik, a
dauntless and skilful soldier, who surpassed the expectation of his
chief; and the necessary transports were provided by the industry of
their too faithful ally. The Saracens landed<a href="#note-174" name="noteref-174"><small>174</small></a> at the pillar or point
of Europe; the corrupt and familiar appellation of Gibraltar (Gebel el
Tarik) describes the mountain of Tarik; and the intrenchments of his
camp were the first outline of those fortifications, which, in the
hands of our countrymen, have resisted the art and power of the house
of Bourbon. The adjacent governors informed the court of Toledo of the
descent and progress of the Arabs; and the defeat of his lieutenant
Edeco, who had been commanded to seize and bind the presumptuous
strangers, admonished Roderic of the magnitude of the danger. At the
royal summons, the dukes and counts, the bishops and nobles of the
Gothic monarchy assembled at the head of their followers; and the title
of king of the Romans, which is employed by an Arabic historian, may
be excused by the close affinity of language, religion, and manners,
between the nations of Spain. His army consisted of ninety or a hundred
thousand men: a formidable power, if their fidelity and discipline had
been adequate to their numbers. The troops of Tarik had been augmented
to twelve thousand Saracens; but the Christian malecontents were
attracted by the influence of Julian, and a crowd of Africans
most greedily tasted the temporal blessings of the Koran. In the
neighbourhood of Cadiz, the town of Xeres<a href="#note-175" name="noteref-175"><small>175</small></a> has been illustrated by
the encounter which determined the fate of the kingdom; the stream of

On the fourth day, the two armies joined a more serious and decisive
issue; but Alaric would have blushed at the sight of his unworthy
successor, sustaining on his head a diadem of pearls, encumbered with a
flowing robe of gold and silken embroidery, and reclining on a litter,
or car of ivory, drawn by two white mules. Notwithstanding the valour of
the Saracens, they fainted under the weight of multitudes, and the plain
of Xeres was overspread with sixteen thousand of their dead bodies. "My
brethren," said Tarik to his surviving companions, "the enemy is before
you, the sea is behind; whither would ye fly? Follow your general I am
resolved either to lose my life, or to trample on the prostrate king of
the Romans." Besides the resource of despair, he confided in the secret
correspondence and nocturnal interviews of count Julian, with the sons
and the brother of Witiza. The two princes and the archbishop of Toledo
occupied the most important post; their well-timed defection broke the
ranks of the Christians; each warrior was prompted by fear or suspicion
to consult his personal safety; and the remains of the Gothic army were
scattered or destroyed to the flight and pursuit of the three following
days. Amidst the general disorder, Roderic started from his car, and
mounted Orelia, the fleetest of his Horses; but he escaped from a
soldier's death to perish more ignobly in the waters of the Boetis or
Guadalquiver. His diadem, his robes, and his courser, were found on the
bank; but as the body of the Gothic prince was lost in the waves, the
pride and ignorance of the caliph must have been gratified with some
meaner head, which was exposed in triumph before the palace of Damascus.
"And such," continues a valiant historian of the Arabs, "is the fate of
those kings who withdraw themselves from a field of battle." <a href="#note-176" name="noteref-176"><small>176</small></a>
</p>
<p>
[A. D. 711.] Count Julian had plunged so deep into guilt and infamy,
that his only hope was in the ruin of his country. After the battle
of Xeres he recommended the most effectual measures to the victorious
Saracens. "The king of the Goths is slain; their princes are fled
before you, the army is routed, the nation is astonished. Secure with
sufficient detachments the cities of Boetica; but in person and without
delay, march to the royal city of Toledo, and allow not the distracted
Christians either time or tranquillity for the election of a new
monarch." Tarik listened to his advice. A Roman captive and proselyte,
who had been enfranchised by the caliph himself, assaulted Cordova with
seven hundred horse: he swam the river, surprised the town, and drove
the Christians into the great church, where they defended themselves
above three months. Another detachment reduced the seacoast of Boetica,
which in the last period of the Moorish power has comprised in a narrow
space the populous kingdom of Grenada. The march of Tarik from the
Boetis to the Tagus,<a href="#note-177" name="noteref-177"><small>177</small></a> was directed through the Sierra Morena, that
separates Andalusia and Castille, till he appeared in arms under the
walls of Toledo.<a href="#note-178" name="noteref-178"><small>178</small></a> The most zealous of the Catholics had escaped with
the relics of their saints; and if the gates were shut, it was only
till the victor had subscribed a fair and reasonable capitulation.
The voluntary exiles were allowed to depart with their effects; seven
churches were appropriated to the Christian worship; the archbishop and
his clergy were at liberty to exercise their functions, the monks to
practise or neglect their penance; and the Goths and Romans were left in
all civil or criminal cases to the subordinate jurisdiction of their
own laws and magistrates. But if the justice of Tarik protected the
Christians, his gratitude and policy rewarded the Jews, to whose
secret or open aid he was indebted for his most important acquisitions.
Persecuted by the kings and synods of Spain, who had often pressed the
alternative of banishment or baptism, that outcast nation embraced the
moment of revenge: the comparison of their past and present state was
the pledge of their fidelity; and the alliance between the disciples of
Moses and those of Mahomet, was maintained till the final era of their
common expulsion.

Romans, acquired by the Goths among the spoils of Rome, and presented by
the Arabs to the throne of Damascus. Beyond the Asturian mountains, the
maritime town of Gijon was the term<a href="#note-180" name="noteref-180"><small>180</small></a> of the lieutenant of Musa, who
had performed with the speed of a traveller, his victorious march of
seven hundred miles, from the rock of Gibraltar to the bay of Biscay.
The failure of land compelled him to retreat: and he was recalled to
Toledo, to excuse his presumption of subduing a kingdom in the absence
of his general. Spain, which in a more savage and disorderly state, had
resisted, two hundred years, the arms of the Romans, was overrun in
a few months by those of the Saracens; and such was the eagerness of
submission and treaty, that the governor of Cordova is recorded as the
only chief who fell, without conditions, a prisoner into their hands.
The cause of the Goths had been irrevocably judged in the field of
Xeres; and in the national dismay, each part of the monarchy declined
a contest with the antagonist who had vanquished the united strength of
the whole.<a href="#note-181" name="noteref-181"><small>181</small></a> That strength had been wasted by two successive seasons
of famine and pestilence; and the governors, who were impatient to
surrender, might exaggerate the difficulty of collecting the provisions

her terrors: and the subtle Arab encouraged the report of dreams, omens,
and prophecies, and of the portraits of the destined conquerors of
Spain, that were discovered on the breaking open an apartment of the
royal palace. Yet a spark of the vital flame was still alive; some
invincible fugitives preferred a life of poverty and freedom in the

<h2>
    Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.&mdash;Part VII.
</h2>
<p>
On the intelligence of this rapid success, the applause of Musa
degenerated into envy; and he began, not to complain, but to fear, that
Tarik would leave him nothing to subdue. At the head of ten thousand
Arabs and eight thousand Africans, he passed over in person from
Mauritania to Spain: the first of his companions were the noblest of
the Koreish; his eldest son was left in the command of Africa; the
three younger brethren were of an age and spirit to second the boldest
enterprises of their father. At his landing in Algezire, he was
respectfully entertained by Count Julian, who stifled his inward
remorse, and testified, both in words and actions, that the victory of
the Arabs had not impaired his attachment to their cause. Some enemies
yet remained for the sword of Musa. The tardy repentance of the Goths
had compared their own numbers and those of the invaders; the cities
from which the march of Tarik had declined considered themselves as
impregnable; and the bravest patriots defended the fortifications of
Seville and Merida. They were successively besieged and reduced by the
labor of Musa, who transported his camp from the Boetis to the Anas,
from the Guadalquivir to the Guadiana. When he beheld the works of Roman
magnificence, the bridge, the aqueducts, the triumphal arches, and the
theatre, of the ancient metropolis of Lusitania, "I should imagine,"
said he to his four companions, "that the human race must have united
their art and power in the foundation of this city: happy is the man
who shall become its master!" He aspired to that happiness, but the
Emeritans sustained on this occasion the honor of their descent from
the veteran legionaries of Augustus <a href="#note-183" name="noteref-183"><small>183</small></a> Disdaining the confinement
of their walls, they gave battle to the Arabs on the plain; but an
ambuscade rising from the shelter of a quarry, or a ruin, chastised
their indiscretion, and intercepted their return.
</p>
<p>
The wooden turrets of assault were rolled forwards to the foot of the
rampart; but the defence of Merida was obstinate and long; and the
castle of the martyrs was a perpetual testimony of the losses of the
Moslems. The constancy of the besieged was at length subdued by famine
and despair; and the prudent victor disguised his impatience under the
names of clemency and esteem. The alternative of exile or tribute was
allowed; the churches were divided between the two religions; and the
wealth of those who had fallen in the siege, or retired to Gallicia, was
confiscated as the reward of the faithful. In the midway between Merida
and Toledo, the lieutenant of Musa saluted the vicegerent of the
caliph, and conducted him to the palace of the Gothic kings. Their
first interview was cold and formal: a rigid account was exacted of the
treasures of Spain: the character of Tarik was exposed to suspicion
and obloquy; and the hero was imprisoned, reviled, and ignominiously
scourged by the hand, or the command, of Musa. Yet so strict was the
discipline, so pure the zeal, or so tame the spirit, of the primitive
Moslems, that, after this public indignity, Tarik could serve and
be trusted in the reduction of the Tarragonest province. A mosch was
erected at Saragossa, by the liberality of the Koreish: the port of
Barcelona was opened to the vessels of Syria; and the Goths were pursued
beyond the Pyrenaean mountains into their Gallic province of Septimania
or Languedoc. <a href="#note-184" name="noteref-184"><small>184</small></a> In the church of St. Mary at Carcassone, Musa found,
but it is improbable that he left, seven equestrian statues of massy
silver; and from his term or column of Narbonne, he returned on his
footsteps to the Gallician and Lusitanian shores of the ocean. During
the absence of the father, his son Abdelaziz chastised the insurgents
of Seville, and reduced, from Malaga to Valentia, the sea-coast of
the Mediterranean: his original treaty with the discreet and valiant
Theodemir <a href="#note-185" name="noteref-185"><small>185</small></a> will represent the manners and policy of the times. "The
conditions of peace agreed and sworn between Abdelaziz, the son of Musa,
the son of Nassir, and Theodemir prince of the Goths. In the name of
the most merciful God, Abdelaziz makes peace on these conditions: that
Theodemir shall not be disturbed in his principality; nor any injury be
offered to the life or property, the wives and children, the religion
and temples, of the Christians: that Theodemir shall freely deliver
his seven <a href="#note-1851" name="noteref-1851"><small>1851</small></a> cities, Orihuela, Valentola, Alicanti Mola, Vacasora,
Bigerra, (now Bejar,) Ora, (or Opta,) and Lorca: that he shall not
assist or entertain the enemies of the caliph, but shall faithfully
communicate his knowledge of their hostile designs: that himself, and
each of the Gothic nobles, shall annually pay one piece of gold, four
measures of wheat, as many of barley, with a certain proportion of
honey, oil, and vinegar; and that each of their vassals shall be taxed
at one moiety of the said imposition. Given the fourth of Regeb, in the
year of the Hegira ninety-four, and subscribed with the names of four
Mussulman witnesses." <a href="#note-186" name="noteref-186"><small>186</small></a> Theodemir and his subjects were treated with
uncommon lenity; but the rate of tribute appears to have fluctuated
from a tenth to a fifth, according to the submission or obstinacy of
the Christians. <a href="#note-187" name="noteref-187"><small>187</small></a> In this revolution, many partial calamities were
inflicted by the carnal or religious passions of the enthusiasts: some
churches were profaned by the new worship: some relics or images were
confounded with idols: the rebels were put to the sword; and one
town (an obscure place between Cordova and Seville) was razed to its
foundations. Yet if we compare the invasion of Spain by the Goths, or
its recovery by the kings of Castile and Arragon, we must applaud the
moderation and discipline of the Arabian conquerors.

The exploits of Musa were performed in the evening of life, though he
affected to disguise his age by coloring with a red powder the whiteness
of his beard. But in the love of action and glory, his breast was
still fired with the ardor of youth; and the possession of Spain was
considered only as the first step to the monarchy of Europe. With
a powerful armament by sea and land, he was preparing to repass the
Pyrenees, to extinguish in Gaul and Italy the declining kingdoms of the
Franks and Lombards, and to preach the unity of God on the altar of the
Vatican. From thence, subduing the Barbarians of Germany, he proposed
to follow the course of the Danube from its source to the Euxine Sea,
to overthrow the Greek or Roman empire of Constantinople, and returning
from Europe to Asia, to unite his new acquisitions with Antioch and
the provinces of Syria. <a href="#note-188" name="noteref-188"><small>188</small></a> But his vast enterprise, perhaps of
easy execution, must have seemed extravagant to vulgar minds; and the
visionary conqueror was soon reminded of his dependence and servitude.
The friends of Tarik had effectually stated his services and wrongs:
at the court of Damascus, the proceedings of Musa were blamed, his
intentions were suspected, and his delay in complying with the first
invitation was chastised by a harsher and more peremptory summons. An
intrepid messenger of the caliph entered his camp at Lugo in Gallicia,
and in the presence of the Saracens and Christians arrested the bridle
of his horse. His own loyalty, or that of his troops, inculcated the
duty of obedience: and his disgrace was alleviated by the recall of his
rival, and the permission of investing with his two governments his two
sons, Abdallah and Abdelaziz. His long triumph from Ceuta to Damascus
displayed the spoils of Africa and the treasures of Spain: four hundred
Gothic nobles, with gold coronets and girdles, were distinguished in his
train; and the number of male and female captives, selected for their
birth or beauty, was computed at eighteen, or even at thirty, thousand
persons. As soon as he reached Tiberias in Palestine, he was apprised
of the sickness and danger of the caliph, by a private message from
Soliman, his brother and presumptive heir; who wished to reserve for his
own reign the spectacle of victory.
</p>
<p>
Had Walid recovered, the delay of Musa would have been criminal: he
pursued his march, and found an enemy on the throne. In his trial before
a partial judge against a popular antagonist, he was convicted of vanity
and falsehood; and a fine of two hundred thousand pieces of gold
either exhausted his poverty or proved his rapaciousness. The unworthy
treatment of Tarik was revenged by a similar indignity; and the veteran
commander, after a public whipping, stood a whole day in the sun before
the palace gate, till he obtained a decent exile, under the pious name
of a pilgrimage to Mecca. The resentment of the caliph might have been
satiated with the ruin of Musa; but his fears demanded the extirpation
of a potent and injured family. A sentence of death was intimated with
secrecy and speed to the trusty servants of the throne both in Africa
and Spain; and the forms, if not the substance, of justice were
superseded in this bloody execution. In the mosch or palace of Cordova,
Abdelaziz was slain by the swords of the conspirators; they accused
their governor of claiming the honors of royalty; and his scandalous
marriage with Egilona, the widow of Roderic, offended the prejudices
both of the Christians and Moslems. By a refinement of cruelty, the
head of the son was presented to the father, with an insulting
question, whether he acknowledged the features of the rebel? "I know his
features," he exclaimed with indignation: "I assert his innocence; and
I imprecate the same, a juster fate, against the authors of his death."
The age and despair of Musa raised him above the power of kings; and he
expired at Mecca of the anguish of a broken heart. His rival was more
favorably treated: his services were forgiven; and Tarik was permitted
to mingle with the crowd of slaves. <a href="#note-189" name="noteref-189"><small>189</small></a> I am ignorant whether Count
Julian was rewarded with the death which he deserved indeed, though not
from the hands of the Saracens; but the tale of their ingratitude to the
sons of Witiza is disproved by the most unquestionable evidence. The two
royal youths were reinstated in the private patrimony of their father;
but on the decease of Eba, the elder, his daughter was unjustly
despoiled of her portion by the violence of her uncle Sigebut. The
Gothic maid pleaded her cause before the caliph Hashem, and obtained the
restitution of her inheritance; but she was given in marriage to a noble
Arabian, and their two sons, Isaac and Ibrahim, were received in Spain
with the consideration that was due to their origin and riches.

<p>
A province is assimilated to the victorious state by the introduction of
strangers and the imitative spirit of the natives; and Spain, which had
been successively tinctured with Punic, and Roman, and Gothic blood,
imbibed, in a few generations, the name and manners of the Arabs. The
first conquerors, and the twenty successive lieutenants of the caliphs,
were attended by a numerous train of civil and military followers, who
preferred a distant fortune to a narrow home: the private and public
interest was promoted by the establishment of faithful colonies; and the
cities of Spain were proud to commemorate the tribe or country of their
Eastern progenitors. The victorious though motley bands of Tarik
and Musa asserted, by the name of Spaniards, their original claim
of conquest; yet they allowed their brethren of Egypt to share their
establishments of Murcia and Lisbon. The royal legion of Damascus was
planted at Cordova; that of Emesa at Seville; that of Kinnisrin or
Chalcis at Jaen; that of Palestine at Algezire and Medina Sidonia. The
natives of Yemen and Persia were scattered round Toledo and the inland
country, and the fertile seats of Grenada were bestowed on ten thousand
horsemen of Syria and Irak, the children of the purest and most noble of
the Arabian tribes. <a href="#note-190" name="noteref-190"><small>190</small></a> A spirit of emulation, sometimes beneficial,
more frequently dangerous, was nourished by these hereditary factions.
Ten years after the conquest, a map of the province was presented to
the caliph: the seas, the rivers, and the harbors, the inhabitants and
cities, the climate, the soil, and the mineral productions of the earth.
<a href="#note-191" name="noteref-191"><small>191</small></a> In the space of two centuries, the gifts of nature were improved

reigned in Spain solicited the support of the Christians; and in

imposition of ten thousand ounces of gold, ten thousand pounds of

<p>
The wars of the Moslems were sanctified by the prophet; but among the
various precepts and examples of his life, the caliphs selected the
lessons of toleration that might tend to disarm the resistance of the
unbelievers. Arabia was the temple and patrimony of the God of Mahomet;
but he beheld with less jealousy and affection the nations of the earth.
The polytheists and idolaters, who were ignorant of his name, might be
lawfully extirpated by his votaries; <a href="#note-196" name="noteref-196"><small>196</small></a> but a wise policy supplied
the obligation of justice; and after some acts of intolerant zeal, the
Mahometan conquerors of Hindostan have spared the pagods of that devout
and populous country. The disciples of Abraham, of Moses, and of Jesus,
were solemnly invited to accept the more perfect revelation of Mahomet;
but if they preferred the payment of a moderate tribute, they were
entitled to the freedom of conscience and religious worship. <a href="#note-197" name="noteref-197"><small>197</small></a> In a
field of battle the forfeit lives of the prisoners were redeemed by the
profession of Islam; the females were bound to embrace the religion of
their masters, and a race of sincere proselytes was gradually multiplied
by the education of the infant captives. But the millions of African
and Asiatic converts, who swelled the native band of the faithful Arabs,
must have been allured, rather than constrained, to declare their belief
in one God and the apostle of God. By the repetition of a sentence and
the loss of a foreskin, the subject or the slave, the captive or
the criminal, arose in a moment the free and equal companion of the
victorious Moslems. Every sin was expiated, every engagement was
dissolved: the vow of celibacy was superseded by the indulgence of
nature; the active spirits who slept in the cloister were awakened by
the trumpet of the Saracens; and in the convulsion of the world, every
member of a new society ascended to the natural level of his capacity
and courage. The minds of the multitude were tempted by the invisible as
well as temporal blessings of the Arabian prophet; and charity will
hope that many of his proselytes entertained a serious conviction of
the truth and sanctity of his revelation. In the eyes of an inquisitive
polytheist, it must appear worthy of the human and the divine nature.
More pure than the system of Zoroaster, more liberal than the law of
Moses, the religion of Mahomet might seem less inconsistent with reason
than the creed of mystery and superstition, which, in the seventh
century, disgraced the simplicity of the gospel.

</p>
<p>
In the extensive provinces of Persia and Africa, the national religion
has been eradicated by the Mahometan faith. The ambiguous theology
of the Magi stood alone among the sects of the East; but the profane
writings of Zoroaster <a href="#note-198" name="noteref-198"><small>198</small></a> might, under the reverend name of Abraham,
be dexterously connected with the chain of divine revelation. Their evil
principle, the daemon Ahriman, might be represented as the rival, or as
the creature, of the God of light. The temples of Persia were devoid of
images; but the worship of the sun and of fire might be stigmatized as a
gross and criminal idolatry. <a href="#note-199" name="noteref-199"><small>199</small></a> The milder sentiment was consecrated
by the practice of Mahomet <a href="#note-200" name="noteref-200"><small>200</small></a> and the prudence of the caliphs; the
Magians or Ghebers were ranked with the Jews and Christians among the
people of the written law; <a href="#note-201" name="noteref-201"><small>201</small></a> and as late as the third century of the
Hegira, the city of Herat will afford a lively contrast of private zeal
and public toleration. <a href="#note-202" name="noteref-202"><small>202</small></a> Under the payment of an annual tribute, the
Mahometan law secured to the Ghebers of Herat their civil and religious
liberties: but the recent and humble mosch was overshadowed by the
antique splendor of the adjoining temple of fire. A fanatic Iman
deplored, in his sermons, the scandalous neighborhood, and accused the
weakness or indifference of the faithful. Excited by his voice, the
people assembled in tumult; the two houses of prayer were consumed
by the flames, but the vacant ground was immediately occupied by the
foundations of a new mosch. The injured Magi appealed to the sovereign
of Chorasan; he promised justice and relief; when, behold! four thousand
citizens of Herat, of a grave character and mature age, unanimously
swore that the idolatrous fane had never existed; the inquisition was
silenced and their conscience was satisfied (says the historian Mirchond
<a href="#note-203" name="noteref-203"><small>203</small></a> with this holy and meritorious perjury. <a href="#note-204" name="noteref-204"><small>204</small></a> But the greatest
part of the temples of Persia were ruined by the insensible and general
desertion of their votaries.
</p>
<p>
It was insensible, since it is not accompanied with any memorial of time
or place, of persecution or resistance. It was general, since the whole
realm, from Shiraz to Samarcand, imbibed the faith of the Koran; and the
preservation of the native tongue reveals the descent of the Mahometans
of Persia. <a href="#note-205" name="noteref-205"><small>205</small></a> In the mountains and deserts, an obstinate race of
unbelievers adhered to the superstition of their fathers; and a faint
tradition of the Magian theology is kept alive in the province of
Kirman, along the banks of the Indus, among the exiles of Surat, and in
the colony which, in the last century, was planted by Shaw Abbas at
the gates of Ispahan. The chief pontiff has retired to Mount Elbourz,
eighteen leagues from the city of Yezd: the perpetual fire (if it
continues to burn) is inaccessible to the profane; but his residence is
the school, the oracle, and the pilgrimage of the Ghebers, whose hard
and uniform features attest the unmingled purity of their blood. Under
the jurisdiction of their elders, eighty thousand families maintain an
innocent and industrious life: their subsistence is derived from some
curious manufactures and mechanic trades; and they cultivate the earth
with the fervor of a religious duty. Their ignorance withstood the
despotism of Shaw Abbas, who demanded with threats and tortures the
prophetic books of Zoroaster; and this obscure remnant of the Magians is
spared by the moderation or contempt of their present sovereigns. <a href="#note-206" name="noteref-206"><small>206</small></a>

The Northern coast of Africa is the only land in which the light of
the gospel, after a long and perfect establishment, has been totally
extinguished. The arts, which had been taught by Carthage and Rome, were
involved in a cloud of ignorance; the doctrine of Cyprian and Augustin
was no longer studied. Five hundred episcopal churches were overturned
by the hostile fury of the Donatists, the Vandals, and the Moors.
The zeal and numbers of the clergy declined; and the people, without
discipline, or knowledge, or hope, submissively sunk under the yoke
of the Arabian prophet Within fifty years after the expulsion of the
Greeks, a lieutenant of Africa informed the caliph that the tribute of
the infidels was abolished by their conversion; <a href="#note-207" name="noteref-207"><small>207</small></a> and, though he
sought to disguise his fraud and rebellion, his specious pretence was
drawn from the rapid and extensive progress of the Mahometan faith. In
the next age, an extraordinary mission of five bishops was detached from
Alexandria to Cairoan. They were ordained by the Jacobite patriarch
to cherish and revive the dying embers of Christianity: <a href="#note-208" name="noteref-208"><small>208</small></a> but the
interposition of a foreign prelate, a stranger to the Latins, an enemy
to the Catholics, supposes the decay and dissolution of the African
hierarchy. It was no longer the time when the successor of St. Cyprian,
at the head of a numerous synod, could maintain an equal contest
with the ambition of the Roman pontiff. In the eleventh century, the
unfortunate priest who was seated on the ruins of Carthage implored the
arms and the protection of the Vatican; and he bitterly complains that
his naked body had been scourged by the Saracens, and that his authority
was disputed by the four suffragans, the tottering pillars of his
throne. Two epistles of Gregory the Seventh <a href="#note-209" name="noteref-209"><small>209</small></a> are destined to soothe
the distress of the Catholics and the pride of a Moorish prince. The
pope assures the sultan that they both worship the same God, and may
hope to meet in the bosom of Abraham; but the complaint that three
bishops could no longer be found to consecrate a brother, announces the
speedy and inevitable ruin of the episcopal order. The Christians
of Africa and Spain had long since submitted to the practice of
circumcision and the legal abstinence from wine and pork; and the
name of Mozarabes <a href="#note-210" name="noteref-210"><small>210</small></a> (adoptive Arabs) was applied to their civil or
religious conformity. <a href="#note-211" name="noteref-211"><small>211</small></a> About the middle of the twelfth century, the
worship of Christ and the succession of pastors were abolished along
the coast of Barbary, and in the kingdoms of Cordova and Seville, of
Valencia and Grenada. <a href="#note-212" name="noteref-212"><small>212</small></a> The throne of the Almohades, or Unitarians,
was founded on the blindest fanaticism, and their extraordinary rigor
might be provoked or justified by the recent victories and intolerant
zeal of the princes of Sicily and Castille, of Arragon and Portugal.
The faith of the Mozarabes was occasionally revived by the papal
missionaries; and, on the landing of Charles the Fifth, some families
of Latin Christians were encouraged to rear their heads at Tunis and
Algiers. But the seed of the gospel was quickly eradicated, and the
long province from Tripoli to the Atlantic has lost all memory of the
language and religion of Rome. <a href="#note-213" name="noteref-213"><small>213</small></a>

After the revolution of eleven centuries, the Jews and Christians of the
Turkish empire enjoy the liberty of conscience which was granted by the
Arabian caliphs. During the first age of the conquest, they suspected
the loyalty of the Catholics, whose name of Melchites betrayed their
secret attachment to the Greek emperor, while the Nestorians and
Jacobites, his inveterate enemies, approved themselves the sincere and
voluntary friends of the Mahometan government. <a href="#note-214" name="noteref-214"><small>214</small></a> Yet this partial
jealousy was healed by time and submission; the churches of Egypt
were shared with the Catholics; <a href="#note-215" name="noteref-215"><small>215</small></a> and all the Oriental sects were
included in the common benefits of toleration. The rank, the immunities,
the domestic jurisdiction of the patriarchs, the bishops, and the
clergy, were protected by the civil magistrate: the learning of
individuals recommended them to the employments of secretaries and
physicians: they were enriched by the lucrative collection of the
revenue; and their merit was sometimes raised to the command of cities
and provinces. A caliph of the house of Abbas was heard to declare
that the Christians were most worthy of trust in the administration of
Persia. "The Moslems," said he, "will abuse their present fortune; the
Magians regret their fallen greatness; and the Jews are impatient for
their approaching deliverance." <a href="#note-216" name="noteref-216"><small>216</small></a> But the slaves of despotism are

to the pride, or the zeal, of the Christians. <a href="#note-217" name="noteref-217"><small>217</small></a> About two hundred
years after Mahomet, they were separated from their fellow-subjects by a
turban or girdle of a less honorable color; instead of horses or mules.
they were condemned to ride on asses, in the attitude of women. Their
public and private building were measured by a diminutive standard; in
the streets or the baths it is their duty to give way or bow down before
the meanest of the people; and their testimony is rejected, if it may
tend to the prejudice of a true believer. The pomp of processions, the
sound of bells or of psalmody, is interdicted in their worship; a
decent reverence for the national faith is imposed on their sermons
and conversations; and the sacrilegious attempt to enter a mosch, or to
seduce a Mussulman, will not be suffered to escape with impunity. In a
time, however, of tranquillity and justice, the Christians have never
been compelled to renounce the Gospel, or to embrace the Koran; but the
punishment of death is inflicted upon the apostates who have professed
and deserted the law of Mahomet. The martyrs of Cordova provoked the
sentence of the cadhi, by the public confession of their inconstancy,
or their passionate invectives against the person and religion of the
prophet. <a href="#note-218" name="noteref-218"><small>218</small></a>

At the end of the first century of the Hegira, the caliphs were the most
potent and absolute monarchs of the globe. Their prerogative was not
circumscribed, either in right or in fact, by the power of the nobles,
the freedom of the commons, the privileges of the church, the votes of
a senate, or the memory of a free constitution. The authority of the
companions of Mahomet expired with their lives; and the chiefs or emirs
of the Arabian tribes left behind, in the desert, the spirit of equality
and independence. The regal and sacerdotal characters were united in the
successors of Mahomet; and if the Koran was the rule of their actions,
they were the supreme judges and interpreters of that divine book. They
reigned by the right of conquest over the nations of the East, to whom
the name of liberty was unknown, and who were accustomed to applaud in
their tyrants the acts of violence and severity that were exercised at
their own expense. Under the last of the Ommiades, the Arabian empire
extended two hundred days' journey from east to west, from the confines
of Tartary and India to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. And if we
retrench the sleeve of the robe, as it is styled by their writers, the
long and narrow province of Africa, the solid and compact dominion from
Fargana to Aden, from Tarsus to Surat, will spread on every side to
the measure of four or five months of the march of a caravan. <a href="#note-219" name="noteref-219"><small>219</small></a>
We should vainly seek the indissoluble union and easy obedience that
pervaded the government of Augustus and the Antonines; but the progress
of the Mahometan religion diffused over this ample space a general
resemblance of manners and opinions. The language and laws of the Koran
were studied with equal devotion at Samarcand and Seville: the Moor
and the Indian embraced as countrymen and brothers in the pilgrimage of
Mecca; and the Arabian language was adopted as the popular idiom in all
the provinces to the westward of the Tigris. <a href="#note-220" name="noteref-220"><small>220</small></a>

conquests in India, Tartary, and the European Turkey.]

the college of Mecca. By the Danish traveller, this ancient idiom is
compared to the Latin; the vulgar tongue of Hejaz and Yemen to the
Italian; and the Arabian dialects of Syria, Egypt, Africa, &amp;c., to the
Provencal, Spanish, and Portuguese, (Niebuhr, Description de l'Arabie,
p. 74, &amp;c.)]
