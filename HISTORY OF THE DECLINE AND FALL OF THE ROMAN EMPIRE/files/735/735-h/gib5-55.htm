<p>
Under the reign of Constantine the grandson of Heraclius, the ancient
barrier of the Danube, so often violated and so often restored, was
irretrievably swept away by a new deluge of Barbarians. Their progress
was favored by the caliphs, their unknown and accidental auxiliaries:
the Roman legions were occupied in Asia; and after the loss of Syria,
Egypt, and Africa, the Caesars were twice reduced to the danger and
disgrace of defending their capital against the Saracens. If, in the
account of this interesting people, I have deviated from the strict and
original line of my undertaking, the merit of the subject will hide my
transgression, or solicit my excuse. In the East, in the West, in war,
in religion, in science, in their prosperity, and in their decay, the
Arabians press themselves on our curiosity: the first overthrow of the
church and empire of the Greeks may be imputed to their arms; and the
disciples of Mahomet still hold the civil and religious sceptre of the
Oriental world. But the same labor would be unworthily bestowed on the
swarms of savages, who, between the seventh and the twelfth century,
descended from the plains of Scythia, in transient inroad or perpetual
emigration. <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> Their names are uncouth, their origins doubtful, their
actions obscure, their superstition was blind, their valor brutal, and
the uniformity of their public and private lives was neither softened
by innocence nor refined by policy. The majesty of the Byzantine throne
repelled and survived their disorderly attacks; the greater part of
these Barbarians has disappeared without leaving any memorial of their
existence, and the despicable remnant continues, and may long continue,
to groan under the dominion of a foreign tyrant. From the antiquities
of, I. Bulgarians, II. Hungarians, and, III. Russians, I shall content
myself with selecting such facts as yet deserve to be remembered. The
conquests of the, IV. Normans, and the monarchy of the, V. Turks, will
naturally terminate in the memorable Crusades to the Holy Land, and the
double fall of the city and empire of Constantine.

[ All the passages of the Byzantine history which relate to
the Barbarians are compiled, methodized, and transcribed, in a Latin
version, by the laborious John Gotthelf Stritter, in his "Memoriae
Populorum, ad Danubium, Pontum Euxinum, Paludem Maeotidem, Caucasum,
Mare Caspium, et inde Magis ad Septemtriones incolentium." Petropoli,
1771-1779; in four tomes, or six volumes, in 4to. But the fashion has
not enhanced the price of these raw materials.]
</p>
<p>
I. In his march to Italy, Theodoric <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> the Ostrogoth had trampled on
the arms of the Bulgarians. After this defeat, the name and the nation
are lost during a century and a half; and it may be suspected that the
same or a similar appellation was revived by strange colonies from the
Borysthenes, the Tanais, or the Volga. A king of the ancient Bulgaria, 
<a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> 
bequeathed to his five sons a last lesson of moderation and concord.
It was received as youth has ever received the counsels of age and
experience: the five princes buried their father; divided his subjects
and cattle; forgot his advice; separated from each other; and wandered
in quest of fortune till we find the most adventurous in the heart of
Italy, under the protection of the exarch of Ravenna. <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> But the stream
of emigration was directed or impelled towards the capital. The modern
Bulgaria, along the southern banks of the Danube, was stamped with
the name and image which it has retained to the present hour: the new
conquerors successively acquired, by war or treaty, the Roman provinces
of Dardania, Thessaly, and the two Epirus; <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> the ecclesiastical
supremacy was translated from the native city of Justinian; and, in
their prosperous age, the obscure town of Lychnidus, or Achrida,
was honored with the throne of a king and a patriarch. <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> The
unquestionable evidence of language attests the descent of the
Bulgarians from the original stock of the Sclavonian, or more properly
Slavonian, race; <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> and the kindred bands of Servians, Bosnians,
Rascians, Croatians, Walachians, <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> &amp;c., followed either the standard
or the example of the leading tribe. From the Euxine to the Adriatic, in
the state of captives, or subjects, or allies, or enemies, of the Greek
empire, they overspread the land; and the national appellation of the
slaves <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> has been degraded by chance or malice from the signification
of glory to that of servitude. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> Among these colonies, the
Chrobatians, <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> or Croats, who now attend the motions of an Austrian
army, are the descendants of a mighty people, the conquerors and
sovereigns of Dalmatia. The maritime cities, and of these the infant
republic of Ragusa, implored the aid and instructions of the Byzantine
court: they were advised by the magnanimous Basil to reserve a small
acknowledgment of their fidelity to the Roman empire, and to appease,
by an annual tribute, the wrath of these irresistible Barbarians. The
kingdom of Crotia was shared by eleven Zoupans, or feudatory lords;
and their united forces were numbered at sixty thousand horse and
one hundred thousand foot. A long sea-coast, indented with capacious
harbors, covered with a string of islands, and almost in sight of the
Italian shores, disposed both the natives and strangers to the practice
of navigation. The boats or brigantines of the Croats were constructed
after the fashion of the old Liburnians: one hundred and eighty vessels
may excite the idea of a respectable navy; but our seamen will smile at
the allowance of ten, or twenty, or forty, men for each of these ships
of war. They were gradually converted to the more honorable service of
commerce; yet the Sclavonian pirates were still frequent and dangerous;
and it was not before the close of the tenth century that the freedom
and sovereignty of the Gulf were effectually vindicated by the Venetian
republic. <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> The ancestors of these Dalmatian kings were equally
removed from the use and abuse of navigation: they dwelt in the White
Croatia, in the inland regions of Silesia and Little Poland, thirty
days' journey, according to the Greek computation, from the sea of
darkness.

word was extended to the general use, to the modern languages, and even
to the style of the last Byzantines, (see the Greek and Latin Glossaries
and Ducange.) The confusion of the Servians with the Latin Servi, was
still more fortunate and familiar, (Constant. Porphyr. de Administrando,

</p>
<p>
The glory of the Bulgarians <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> was confined to a narrow scope both of
time and place. In the ninth and tenth centuries, they reigned to the
south of the Danube; but the more powerful nations that had followed
their emigration repelled all return to the north and all progress to
the west. Yet in the obscure catalogue of their exploits, they might
boast an honor which had hitherto been appropriated to the Goths: that
of slaying in battle one of the successors of Augustus and Constantine.
The emperor Nicephorus had lost his fame in the Arabian, he lost his
life in the Sclavonian, war. In his first operations he advanced with
boldness and success into the centre of Bulgaria, and burnt the royal
court, which was probably no more than an edifice and village of timber.
But while he searched the spoil and refused all offers of treaty, his
enemies collected their spirits and their forces: the passes of retreat
were insuperably barred; and the trembling Nicephorus was heard to
exclaim, "Alas, alas! unless we could assume the wings of birds, we
cannot hope to escape." Two days he waited his fate in the inactivity of
despair; but, on the morning of the third, the Bulgarians surprised the
camp, and the Roman prince, with the great officers of the empire,
were slaughtered in their tents. The body of Valens had been saved
from insult; but the head of Nicephorus was exposed on a spear, and
his skull, enchased with gold, was often replenished in the feasts
of victory. The Greeks bewailed the dishonor of the throne; but they
acknowledged the just punishment of avarice and cruelty. This savage cup
was deeply tinctured with the manners of the Scythian wilderness; but
they were softened before the end of the same century by a peaceful
intercourse with the Greeks, the possession of a cultivated region, and
the introduction of the Christian worship. The nobles of Bulgaria were
educated in the schools and palace of Constantinople; and Simeon, <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a>
a youth of the royal line, was instructed in the rhetoric of Demosthenes
and the logic of Aristotle. He relinquished the profession of a monk for
that of a king and warrior; and in his reign of more than forty years,
Bulgaria assumed a rank among the civilized powers of the earth. The
Greeks, whom he repeatedly attacked, derived a faint consolation from
indulging themselves in the reproaches of perfidy and sacrilege. They
purchased the aid of the Pagan Turks; but Simeon, in a second battle,
redeemed the loss of the first, at a time when it was esteemed a
victory to elude the arms of that formidable nation. The Servians
were overthrown, made captive and dispersed; and those who visited
the country before their restoration could discover no more than
fifty vagrants, without women or children, who extorted a precarious
subsistence from the chase. On classic ground, on the banks of Achelous,
the greeks were defeated; their horn was broken by the strength of the
Barbaric Hercules. <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> He formed the siege of Constantinople; and, in
a personal conference with the emperor, Simeon imposed the conditions of
peace. They met with the most jealous precautions: the royal gallery
was drawn close to an artificial and well-fortified platform; and the
majesty of the purple was emulated by the pomp of the Bulgarian. "Are
you a Christian?" said the humble Romanus: "it is your duty to abstain
from the blood of your fellow-Christians. Has the thirst of riches
seduced you from the blessings of peace? Sheathe your sword, open
your hand, and I will satiate the utmost measure of your desires." The
reconciliation was sealed by a domestic alliance; the freedom of trade
was granted or restored; the first honors of the court were secured to
the friends of Bulgaria, above the ambassadors of enemies or strangers;
<a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> and her princes were dignified with the high and invidious title of
Basileus, or emperor. But this friendship was soon disturbed: after the
death of Simeon, the nations were again in arms; his feeble successors
were divided and extinguished; and, in the beginning of the eleventh
century, the second Basil, who was born in the purple, deserved the
appellation of conqueror of the Bulgarians. His avarice was in some
measure gratified by a treasure of four hundred thousand pounds
sterling, (ten thousand pounds' weight of gold,) which he found in
the palace of Lychnidus. His cruelty inflicted a cool and exquisite
vengeance on fifteen thousand captives who had been guilty of the
defence of their country. They were deprived of sight; but to one of
each hundred a single eye was left, that he might conduct his blind
century to the presence of their king. Their king is said to have
expired of grief and horror; the nation was awed by this terrible
example; the Bulgarians were swept away from their settlements, and
circumscribed within a narrow province; the surviving chiefs bequeathed
to their children the advice of patience and the duty of revenge.

II. When the black swarm of Hungarians first hung over Europe, above
nine hundred years after the Christian aera, they were mistaken by fear
and superstition for the Gog and Magog of the Scriptures, the signs
and forerunners of the end of the world. <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> Since the introduction
of letters, they have explored their own antiquities with a strong and
laudable impulse of patriotic curiosity. <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> Their rational criticism
can no longer be amused with a vain pedigree of Attila and the Huns; but
they complain that their primitive records have perished in the Tartar
war; that the truth or fiction of their rustic songs is long since
forgotten; and that the fragments of a rude chronicle <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> must be
painfully reconciled with the contemporary though foreign intelligence
of the imperial geographer. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> Magiar is the national and oriental
denomination of the Hungarians; but, among the tribes of Scythia, they
are distinguished by the Greeks under the proper and peculiar name of
Turks, as the descendants of that mighty people who had conquered
and reigned from China to the Volga. The Pannonian colony preserved a
correspondence of trade and amity with the eastern Turks on the confines
of Persia and after a separation of three hundred and fifty years, the
missionaries of the king of Hungary discovered and visited their ancient
country near the banks of the Volga. They were hospitably entertained
by a people of Pagans and Savages who still bore the name of Hungarians;
conversed in their native tongue, recollected a tradition of their
long-lost brethren, and listened with amazement to the marvellous tale
of their new kingdom and religion. The zeal of conversion was animated
by the interest of consanguinity; and one of the greatest of
their princes had formed the generous, though fruitless, design of
replenishing the solitude of Pannonia by this domestic colony from the
heart of Tartary. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> From this primitive country they were driven to
the West by the tide of war and emigration, by the weight of the more
distant tribes, who at the same time were fugitives and conquerors.
<a href="#note-2111" name="noteref-2111"><small>2111</small></a> Reason or fortune directed their course towards the frontiers of
the Roman empire: they halted in the usual stations along the banks of
the great rivers; and in the territories of Moscow, Kiow, and Moldavia,
some vestiges have been discovered of their temporary residence. In
this long and various peregrination, they could not always escape the
dominion of the stronger; and the purity of their blood was improved or
sullied by the mixture of a foreign race: from a motive of compulsion,
or choice, several tribes of the Chazars were associated to the standard
of their ancient vassals; introduced the use of a second language; and
obtained by their superior renown the most honorable place in the front
of battle. The military force of the Turks and their allies marched in
seven equal and artificial divisions; each division was formed of thirty
thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven warriors, and the proportion of
women, children, and servants, supposes and requires at least a million
of emigrants. Their public counsels were directed by seven vayvods,
or hereditary chiefs; but the experience of discord and weakness
recommended the more simple and vigorous administration of a single
person. The sceptre, which had been declined by the modest Lebedias,
was granted to the birth or merit of Almus and his son Arpad, and the
authority of the supreme khan of the Chazars confirmed the engagement of
the prince and people; of the people to obey his commands, of the prince
to consult their happiness and glory.

With this narrative we might be reasonably content, if the penetration
of modern learning had not opened a new and larger prospect of the
antiquities of nations. The Hungarian language stands alone, and as it
were insulated, among the Sclavonian dialects; but it bears a close and
clear affinity to the idioms of the Fennic race, <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> of an obsolete and
savage race, which formerly occupied the northern regions of Asia and
Europe. <a href="#note-2211" name="noteref-2211"><small>2211</small></a> The genuine appellation of Ugri or Igours is found on
the western confines of China; <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> their migration to the banks of the
Irtish is attested by Tartar evidence; <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> a similar name and language
are detected in the southern parts of Siberia; <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> and the remains of
the Fennic tribes are widely, though thinly scattered from the sources
of the Oby to the shores of Lapland. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> The consanguinity of the
Hungarians and Laplanders would display the powerful energy of climate
on the children of a common parent; the lively contrast between the bold
adventurers who are intoxicated with the wines of the Danube, and the
wretched fugitives who are immersed beneath the snows of the polar
circle.

with a vigorous constitution of soul and body. <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> Extreme cold has

<h2>
    Chapter LV: The Bulgarians, The Hungarians And The Russians.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
It is the observation of the Imperial author of the Tactics, <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> that
all the Scythian hordes resembled each other in their pastoral and
military life, that they all practised the same means of subsistence,
and employed the same instruments of destruction. But he adds, that
the two nations of Bulgarians and Hungarians were superior to their
brethren, and similar to each other in the improvements, however rude,
of their discipline and government: their visible likeness determines
Leo to confound his friends and enemies in one common description; and
the picture may be heightened by some strokes from their contemporaries
of the tenth century. Except the merit and fame of military prowess,
all that is valued by mankind appeared vile and contemptible to these
Barbarians, whose native fierceness was stimulated by the consciousness
of numbers and freedom. The tents of the Hungarians were of leather,
their garments of fur; they shaved their hair, and scarified their
faces: in speech they were slow, in action prompt, in treaty perfidious;
and they shared the common reproach of Barbarians, too ignorant to
conceive the importance of truth, too proud to deny or palliate the
breach of their most solemn engagements. Their simplicity has been
praised; yet they abstained only from the luxury they had never known;
whatever they saw they coveted; their desires were insatiate, and their
sole industry was the hand of violence and rapine. By the definition of
a pastoral nation, I have recalled a long description of the economy,
the warfare, and the government that prevail in that state of society;
I may add, that to fishing, as well as to the chase, the Hungarians
were indebted for a part of their subsistence; and since they seldom
cultivated the ground, they must, at least in their new settlements,
have sometimes practised a slight and unskilful husbandry. In their
emigrations, perhaps in their expeditions, the host was accompanied
by thousands of sheep and oxen which increased the cloud of formidable
dust, and afforded a constant and wholesale supply of milk and animal
food. A plentiful command of forage was the first care of the general,
and if the flocks and herds were secure of their pastures, the hardy
warrior was alike insensible of danger and fatigue. The confusion of men
and cattle that overspread the country exposed their camp to a nocturnal
surprise, had not a still wider circuit been occupied by their light
cavalry, perpetually in motion to discover and delay the approach of the
enemy. After some experience of the Roman tactics, they adopted the
use of the sword and spear, the helmet of the soldier, and the iron
breastplate of his steed: but their native and deadly weapon was the
Tartar bow: from the earliest infancy their children and servants were
exercised in the double science of archery and horsemanship; their arm
was strong; their aim was sure; and in the most rapid career, they were
taught to throw themselves backwards, and to shoot a volley of arrows
into the air. In open combat, in secret ambush, in flight, or pursuit,
they were equally formidable; an appearance of order was maintained
in the foremost ranks, but their charge was driven forwards by the
impatient pressure of succeeding crowds. They pursued, headlong and
rash, with loosened reins and horrific outcries; but, if they fled, with
real or dissembled fear, the ardor of a pursuing foe was checked and
chastised by the same habits of irregular speed and sudden evolution.
In the abuse of victory, they astonished Europe, yet smarting from the
wounds of the Saracen and the Dane: mercy they rarely asked, and more
rarely bestowed: both sexes were accused is equally inaccessible to
pity, and their appetite for raw flesh might countenance the popular
tale, that they drank the blood, and feasted on the hearts of the slain.
Yet the Hungarians were not devoid of those principles of justice and
humanity, which nature has implanted in every bosom. The license of
public and private injuries was restrained by laws and punishments; and
in the security of an open camp, theft is the most tempting and
most dangerous offence. Among the Barbarians there were many, whose
spontaneous virtue supplied their laws and corrected their manners, who
performed the duties, and sympathized with the affections, of social
life.

[ Leo has observed, that the government of the Turks was
monarchical, and that their punishments were rigorous, (Tactic. p. 896)
Rhegino (in Chron. A.D. 889) mentions theft as a capital crime, and his
jurisprudence is confirmed by the original code of St. Stephen, (A.D.
1016.) If a slave were guilty, he was chastised, for the first time,
with the loss of his nose, or a fine of five heifers; for the second,
with the loss of his ears, or a similar fine; for the third, with death;
which the freeman did not incur till the fourth offence, as his first
penalty was the loss of liberty, (Katona, Hist. Regum Hungar tom. i. p.
231, 232.)]
</p>
<p>
After a long pilgrimage of flight or victory, the Turkish hordes
approached the common limits of the French and Byzantine empires. Their
first conquests and final settlements extended on either side of the
Danube above Vienna, below Belgrade, and beyond the measure of the Roman
province of Pannonia, or the modern kingdom of Hungary. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> That ample
and fertile land was loosely occupied by the Moravians, a Sclavonian
name and tribe, which were driven by the invaders into the compass of a
narrow province. Charlemagne had stretched a vague and nominal empire
as far as the edge of Transylvania; but, after the failure of his
legitimate line, the dukes of Moravia forgot their obedience and tribute
to the monarchs of Oriental France. The bastard Arnulph was provoked to
invite the arms of the Turks: they rushed through the real or figurative
wall, which his indiscretion had thrown open; and the king of Germany
has been justly reproached as a traitor to the civil and ecclesiastical
society of the Christians. During the life of Arnulph, the Hungarians
were checked by gratitude or fear; but in the infancy of his son Lewis
they discovered and invaded Bavaria; and such was their Scythian speed,
that in a single day a circuit of fifty miles was stripped and consumed.
In the battle of Augsburgh the Christians maintained their advantage
till the seventh hour of the day, they were deceived and vanquished by
the flying stratagems of the Turkish cavalry. The conflagration spread
over the provinces of Bavaria, Swabia, and Franconia; and the Hungarians
<a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> promoted the reign of anarchy, by forcing the stoutest barons to
discipline their vassals and fortify their castles. The origin of walled
towns is ascribed to this calamitous period; nor could any distance be
secure against an enemy, who, almost at the same instant, laid in ashes
the Helvetian monastery of St. Gall, and the city of Bremen, on the
shores of the northern ocean. Above thirty years the Germanic empire,
or kingdom, was subject to the ignominy of tribute; and resistance was
disarmed by the menace, the serious and effectual menace of dragging the
women and children into captivity, and of slaughtering the males above
the age of ten years. I have neither power nor inclination to follow the
Hungarians beyond the Rhine; but I must observe with surprise, that
the southern provinces of France were blasted by the tempest, and that
Spain, behind her Pyrenees, was astonished at the approach of these
formidable strangers. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> The vicinity of Italy had tempted their early
inroads; but from their camp on the Brenta, they beheld with some terror
the apparent strength and populousness of the new discovered country.
They requested leave to retire; their request was proudly rejected by
the Italian king; and the lives of twenty thousand Christians paid the
forfeit of his obstinacy and rashness. Among the cities of the West, the
royal Pavia was conspicuous in fame and splendor; and the preeminence
of Rome itself was only derived from the relics of the apostles. The
Hungarians appeared; Pavia was in flames; forty-three churches were
consumed; and, after the massacre of the people, they spared about two
hundred wretches who had gathered some bushels of gold and silver (a
vague exaggeration) from the smoking ruins of their country. In these
annual excursions from the Alps to the neighborhood of Rome and Capua,
the churches, that yet escaped, resounded with a fearful litany: "O,
save and deliver us from the arrows of the Hungarians!" But the saints
were deaf or inexorable; and the torrent rolled forwards, till it was
stopped by the extreme land of Calabria. <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> A composition was offered
and accepted for the head of each Italian subject; and ten bushels
of silver were poured forth in the Turkish camp. But falsehood is the
natural antagonist of violence; and the robbers were defrauded both in
the numbers of the assessment and the standard of the metal. On the side
of the East, the Hungarians were opposed in doubtful conflict by the
equal arms of the Bulgarians, whose faith forbade an alliance with the
Pagans, and whose situation formed the barrier of the Byzantine empire.
The barrier was overturned; the emperor of Constantinople beheld the
waving banners of the Turks; and one of their boldest warriors presumed
to strike a battle-axe into the golden gate. The arts and treasures
of the Greeks diverted the assault; but the Hungarians might boast, in
their retreat, that they had imposed a tribute on the spirit of Bulgaria
and the majesty of the Caesars. <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> The remote and rapid operations of
the same campaign appear to magnify the power and numbers of the Turks;
but their courage is most deserving of praise, since a light troop of
three or four hundred horse would often attempt and execute the most
daring inroads to the gates of Thessalonica and Constantinople. At this
disastrous aera of the ninth and tenth centuries, Europe was afflicted
by a triple scourge from the North, the East, and the South: the Norman,
the Hungarian, and the Saracen, sometimes trod the same ground of
desolation; and these savage foes might have been compared by Homer
to the two lions growling over the carcass of a mangled stag. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a>

<p>
The deliverance of Germany and Christendom was achieved by the Saxon
princes, Henry the Fowler and Otho the Great, who, in two memorable
battles, forever broke the power of the Hungarians. <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> The valiant
Henry was roused from a bed of sickness by the invasion of his country;
but his mind was vigorous and his prudence successful. "My companions,"
said he, on the morning of the combat, "maintain your ranks, receive on
your bucklers the first arrows of the Pagans, and prevent their second
discharge by the equal and rapid career of your lances." They obeyed
and conquered: and the historical picture of the castle of Merseburgh
expressed the features, or at least the character, of Henry, who, in
an age of ignorance, intrusted to the finer arts the perpetuity of his
name. <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> At the end of twenty years, the children of the Turks who had
fallen by his sword invaded the empire of his son; and their force is
defined, in the lowest estimate, at one hundred thousand horse.
They were invited by domestic faction; the gates of Germany were
treacherously unlocked; and they spread, far beyond the Rhine and the
Meuse, into the heart of Flanders. But the vigor and prudence of Otho
dispelled the conspiracy; the princes were made sensible that
unless they were true to each other, their religion and country were
irrecoverably lost; and the national powers were reviewed in the plains
of Augsburgh. They marched and fought in eight legions, according to
the division of provinces and tribes; the first, second, and third, were
composed of Bavarians; the fourth, of Franconians; the fifth, of Saxons,
under the immediate command of the monarch; the sixth and seventh
consisted of Swabians; and the eighth legion, of a thousand Bohemians,
closed the rear of the host. The resources of discipline and valor were
fortified by the arts of superstition, which, on this occasion, may
deserve the epithets of generous and salutary. The soldiers were
purified with a fast; the camp was blessed with the relics of saints
and martyrs; and the Christian hero girded on his side the sword of
Constantine, grasped the invincible spear of Charlemagne, and waved
the banner of St. Maurice, the praefect of the Thebaean legion. But his
firmest confidence was placed in the holy lance, <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> whose point was
fashioned of the nails of the cross, and which his father had extorted
from the king of Burgundy, by the threats of war, and the gift of a
province. The Hungarians were expected in the front; they secretly
passed the Lech, a river of Bavaria that falls into the Danube; turned
the rear of the Christian army; plundered the baggage, and disordered
the legion of Bohemia and Swabia. The battle was restored by the
Franconians, whose duke, the valiant Conrad, was pierced with an arrow
as he rested from his fatigues: the Saxons fought under the eyes of
their king; and his victory surpassed, in merit and importance, the
triumphs of the last two hundred years. The loss of the Hungarians was
still greater in the flight than in the action; they were encompassed by
the rivers of Bavaria; and their past cruelties excluded them from
the hope of mercy. Three captive princes were hanged at Ratisbon, the
multitude of prisoners was slain or mutilated, and the fugitives, who
presumed to appear in the face of their country, were condemned to
everlasting poverty and disgrace. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> Yet the spirit of the nation was
humbled, and the most accessible passes of Hungary were fortified with
a ditch and rampart. Adversity suggested the counsels of moderation and
peace: the robbers of the West acquiesced in a sedentary life; and the
next generation was taught, by a discerning prince, that far more might
be gained by multiplying and exchanging the produce of a fruitful soil.
The native race, the Turkish or Fennic blood, was mingled with new
colonies of Scythian or Sclavonian origin; <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> many thousands of robust
and industrious captives had been imported from all the countries of
Europe; <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> and after the marriage of Geisa with a Bavarian princess,
he bestowed honors and estates on the nobles of Germany. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> The son of
Geisa was invested with the regal title, and the house of Arpad
reigned three hundred years in the kingdom of Hungary. But the freeborn
Barbarians were not dazzled by the lustre of the diadem, and the people
asserted their indefeasible right of choosing, deposing, and punishing
the hereditary servant of the state.

III. The name of Russians <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> was first divulged, in the ninth century,
by an embassy of Theophilus, emperor of the East, to the emperor of the
West, Lewis, the son of Charlemagne. The Greeks were accompanied by the
envoys of the great duke, or chagan, or czar, of the Russians. In their
journey to Constantinople, they had traversed many hostile nations;
and they hoped to escape the dangers of their return, by requesting
the French monarch to transport them by sea to their native country. A
closer examination detected their origin: they were the brethren of
the Swedes and Normans, whose name was already odious and formidable in
France; and it might justly be apprehended, that these Russian strangers
were not the messengers of peace, but the emissaries of war. They were
detained, while the Greeks were dismissed; and Lewis expected a more
satisfactory account, that he might obey the laws of hospitality
or prudence, according to the interest of both empires. <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> This
Scandinavian origin of the people, or at least the princes, of Russia,
may be confirmed and illustrated by the national annals <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> and
the general history of the North. The Normans, who had so long been
concealed by a veil of impenetrable darkness, suddenly burst forth in
the spirit of naval and military enterprise. The vast, and, as it is
said, the populous regions of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, were crowded
with independent chieftains and desperate adventurers, who sighed in the
laziness of peace, and smiled in the agonies of death. Piracy was the
exercise, the trade, the glory, and the virtue, of the Scandinavian
youth. Impatient of a bleak climate and narrow limits, they started
from the banquet, grasped their arms, sounded their horn, ascended
their vessels, and explored every coast that promised either spoil or
settlement. The Baltic was the first scene of their naval achievements
they visited the eastern shores, the silent residence of Fennic and
Sclavonic tribes, and the primitive Russians of the Lake Ladoga paid
a tribute, the skins of white squirrels, to these strangers, whom they
saluted with the title of Varangians <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> or Corsairs. Their superiority
in arms, discipline, and renown, commanded the fear and reverence of the
natives. In their wars against the more inland savages, the Varangians
condescended to serve as friends and auxiliaries, and gradually, by
choice or conquest, obtained the dominion of a people whom they were
qualified to protect. Their tyranny was expelled, their valor was again
recalled, till at length Ruric, a Scandinavian chief, became the father
of a dynasty which reigned above seven hundred years. His brothers
extended his influence: the example of service and usurpation was
imitated by his companions in the southern provinces of Russia; and
their establishments, by the usual methods of war and assassination,
were cemented into the fabric of a powerful monarchy.

Russians, or Vareques, from Scandinavia. The names of the first founders
of the Russian monarchy are Scandinavian or Norman. Their language
(according to Const. Porphyrog. de Administrat. Imper. c. 9) differed
essentially from the Sclavonian. The author of the Annals of St. Bertin,
who first names the Russians (Rhos) in the year 839 of his Annals,
assigns them Sweden for their country. So Liutprand calls the Russians
the same people as the Normans. The Fins, Laplanders, and Esthonians,
call the Swedes, to the present day, Roots, Rootsi, Ruotzi, Rootslaue.

As long as the descendants of Ruric were considered as aliens and
conquerors, they ruled by the sword of the Varangians, distributed

But when the Scandinavian chiefs had struck a deep and permanent root
into the soil, they mingled with the Russians in blood, religion,
and language, and the first Waladimir had the merit of delivering his
country from these foreign mercenaries. They had seated him on the
throne; his riches were insufficient to satisfy their demands; but
they listened to his pleasing advice, that they should seek, not a
more grateful, but a more wealthy, master; that they should embark for
Greece, where, instead of the skins of squirrels, silk and gold would
be the recompense of their service. At the same time, the Russian prince
admonished his Byzantine ally to disperse and employ, to recompense and
restrain, these impetuous children of the North. Contemporary writers
have recorded the introduction, name, and character, of the Varangians:
each day they rose in confidence and esteem; the whole body was
assembled at Constantinople to perform the duty of guards; and their
strength was recruited by a numerous band of their countrymen from the
Island of Thule. On this occasion, the vague appellation of Thule is
applied to England; and the new Varangians were a colony of English
and Danes who fled from the yoke of the Norman conqueror. The habits of
pilgrimage and piracy had approximated the countries of the earth; these
exiles were entertained in the Byzantine court; and they preserved, till
the last age of the empire, the inheritance of spotless loyalty, and the
use of the Danish or English tongue. With their broad and double-edged
battle-axes on their shoulders, they attended the Greek emperor to the
temple, the senate, and the hippodrome; he slept and feasted under their
trusty guard; and the keys of the palace, the treasury, and the capital,
were held by the firm and faithful hands of the Varangians. <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a>

In the tenth century, the geography of Scythia was extended far beyond
the limits of ancient knowledge; and the monarchy of the Russians
obtains a vast and conspicuous place in the map of Constantine. <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a>
The sons of Ruric were masters of the spacious province of Wolodomir,
or Moscow; and, if they were confined on that side by the hordes of the
East, their western frontier in those early days was enlarged to the
Baltic Sea and the country of the Prussians. Their northern reign
ascended above the sixtieth degree of latitude over the Hyperborean
regions, which fancy had peopled with monsters, or clouded with eternal
darkness. To the south they followed the course of the Borysthenes,
and approached with that river the neighborhood of the Euxine Sea. The
tribes that dwelt, or wandered, in this ample circuit were obedient to
the same conqueror, and insensibly blended into the same nation. The
language of Russia is a dialect of the Sclavonian; but in the tenth
century, these two modes of speech were different from each other; and,
as the Sclavonian prevailed in the South, it may be presumed that the
original Russians of the North, the primitive subjects of the Varangian
chief, were a portion of the Fennic race. With the emigration, union, or
dissolution, of the wandering tribes, the loose and indefinite picture
of the Scythian desert has continually shifted. But the most ancient
map of Russia affords some places which still retain their name and
position; and the two capitals, Novogorod <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> and Kiow, <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> are coeval
with the first age of the monarchy. Novogorod had not yet deserved
the epithet of great, nor the alliance of the Hanseatic League, which
diffused the streams of opulence and the principles of freedom. Kiow
could not yet boast of three hundred churches, an innumerable people,
and a degree of greatness and splendor which was compared with
Constantinople by those who had never seen the residence of the Caesars.
In their origin, the two cities were no more than camps or fairs, the
most convenient stations in which the Barbarians might assemble for the
occasional business of war or trade. Yet even these assemblies announce
some progress in the arts of society; a new breed of cattle was imported
from the southern provinces; and the spirit of commercial enterprise
pervaded the sea and land, from the Baltic to the Euxine, from the mouth
of the Oder to the port of Constantinople. In the days of idolatry and
barbarism, the Sclavonic city of Julin was frequented and enriched
by the Normans, who had prudently secured a free mart of purchase
and exchange. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> From this harbor, at the entrance of the Oder, the
corsair, or merchant, sailed in forty-three days to the eastern shores
of the Baltic, the most distant nations were intermingled, and the
holy groves of Curland are said to have been decorated with Grecian and
Spanish gold. <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> Between the sea and Novogorod an easy intercourse
was discovered; in the summer, through a gulf, a lake, and a navigable
river; in the winter season, over the hard and level surface of
boundless snows. From the neighborhood of that city, the Russians
descended the streams that fall into the Borysthenes; their canoes, of a
single tree, were laden with slaves of every age, furs of every species,
the spoil of their beehives, and the hides of their cattle; and the
whole produce of the North was collected and discharged in the magazines
of Kiow. The month of June was the ordinary season of the departure of
the fleet: the timber of the canoes was framed into the oars and benches
of more solid and capacious boats; and they proceeded without obstacle
down the Borysthenes, as far as the seven or thirteen ridges of rocks,
which traverse the bed, and precipitate the waters, of the river. At
the more shallow falls it was sufficient to lighten the vessels; but the
deeper cataracts were impassable; and the mariners, who dragged their
vessels and their slaves six miles over land, were exposed in this
toilsome journey to the robbers of the desert. <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> At the first island
below the falls, the Russians celebrated the festival of their escape:
at a second, near the mouth of the river, they repaired their shattered
vessels for the longer and more perilous voyage of the Black Sea. If
they steered along the coast, the Danube was accessible; with a fair
wind they could reach in thirty-six or forty hours the opposite shores
of Anatolia; and Constantinople admitted the annual visit of the
strangers of the North. They returned at the stated season with a rich
cargo of corn, wine, and oil, the manufactures of Greece, and the spices
of India. Some of their countrymen resided in the capital and
provinces; and the national treaties protected the persons, effects, and
privileges, of the Russian merchant. <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a>

But the same communication which had been opened for the benefit, was
soon abused for the injury, of mankind. In a period of one hundred and
ninety years, the Russians made four attempts to plunder the treasures
of Constantinople: the event was various, but the motive, the means, and
the object, were the same in these naval expeditions. <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> The Russian
traders had seen the magnificence, and tasted the luxury of the city of
the Caesars. A marvellous tale, and a scanty supply, excited the desires
of their savage countrymen: they envied the gifts of nature which their
climate denied; they coveted the works of art, which they were too lazy
to imitate and too indigent to purchase; the Varangian princes unfurled
the banners of piratical adventure, and their bravest soldiers were
drawn from the nations that dwelt in the northern isles of the ocean.
<a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> The image of their naval armaments was revived in the last century,
in the fleets of the Cossacks, which issued from the Borysthenes, to
navigate the same seas for a similar purpose. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> The Greek appellation
of monoxyla, or single canoes, might justly be applied to the bottom of
their vessels. It was scooped out of the long stem of a beech or willow,
but the slight and narrow foundation was raised and continued on either
side with planks, till it attained the length of sixty, and the height
of about twelve, feet. These boats were built without a deck, but with
two rudders and a mast; to move with sails and oars; and to contain from
forty to seventy men, with their arms, and provisions of fresh water
and salt fish. The first trial of the Russians was made with two hundred
boats; but when the national force was exerted, they might arm against
Constantinople a thousand or twelve hundred vessels. Their fleet was not
much inferior to the royal navy of Agamemnon, but it was magnified in
the eyes of fear to ten or fifteen times the real proportion of its
strength and numbers. Had the Greek emperors been endowed with foresight
to discern, and vigor to prevent, perhaps they might have sealed with a
maritime force the mouth of the Borysthenes. Their indolence abandoned
the coast of Anatolia to the calamities of a piratical war, which, after
an interval of six hundred years, again infested the Euxine; but as
long as the capital was respected, the sufferings of a distant province
escaped the notice both of the prince and the historian. The storm which
had swept along from the Phasis and Trebizond, at length burst on
the Bosphorus of Thrace; a strait of fifteen miles, in which the rude
vessels of the Russians might have been stopped and destroyed by a more
skilful adversary. In their first enterprise <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> under the princes
of Kiow, they passed without opposition, and occupied the port of
Constantinople in the absence of the emperor Michael, the son of
Theophilus. Through a crowd of perils, he landed at the palace-stairs,
and immediately repaired to a church of the Virgin Mary. <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> By the
advice of the patriarch, her garment, a precious relic, was drawn from
the sanctuary and dipped in the sea; and a seasonable tempest, which
determined the retreat of the Russians, was devoutly ascribed to the
mother of God. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> The silence of the Greeks may inspire some doubt of
the truth, or at least of the importance, of the second attempt by Oleg,
the guardian of the sons of Ruric. <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> A strong barrier of arms and
fortifications defended the Bosphorus: they were eluded by the usual
expedient of drawing the boats over the isthmus; and this simple
operation is described in the national chronicles, as if the Russian
fleet had sailed over dry land with a brisk and favorable gale. The
leader of the third armament, Igor, the son of Ruric, had chosen a
moment of weakness and decay, when the naval powers of the empire
were employed against the Saracens. But if courage be not wanting, the
instruments of defence are seldom deficient. Fifteen broken and decayed
galleys were boldly launched against the enemy; but instead of the
single tube of Greek fire usually planted on the prow, the sides
and stern of each vessel were abundantly supplied with that liquid
combustible. The engineers were dexterous; the weather was propitious;
many thousand Russians, who chose rather to be drowned than burnt,
leaped into the sea; and those who escaped to the Thracian shore were
inhumanly slaughtered by the peasants and soldiers. Yet one third of the
canoes escaped into shallow water; and the next spring Igor was again
prepared to retrieve his disgrace and claim his revenge. <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> After
a long peace, Jaroslaus, the great grandson of Igor, resumed the same
project of a naval invasion. A fleet, under the command of his son, was
repulsed at the entrance of the Bosphorus by the same artificial
flames. But in the rashness of pursuit, the vanguard of the Greeks
was encompassed by an irresistible multitude of boats and men; their
provision of fire was probably exhausted; and twenty-four galleys were
either taken, sunk, or destroyed. <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a>

Yet the threats or calamities of a Russian war were more frequently
diverted by treaty than by arms. In these naval hostilities, every
disadvantage was on the side of the Greeks; their savage enemy afforded
no mercy: his poverty promised no spoil; his impenetrable retreat
deprived the conqueror of the hopes of revenge; and the pride or
weakness of empire indulged an opinion, that no honor could be gained
or lost in the intercourse with Barbarians. At first their demands were
high and inadmissible, three pounds of gold for each soldier or mariner
of the fleet: the Russian youth adhered to the design of conquest and
glory; but the counsels of moderation were recommended by the hoary
sages. "Be content," they said, "with the liberal offers of Caesar; it
is not far better to obtain without a combat the possession of gold,
silver, silks, and all the objects of our desires? Are we sure of
victory? Can we conclude a treaty with the sea? We do not tread on the
land; we float on the abyss of water, and a common death hangs over our
heads." <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> The memory of these Arctic fleets that seemed to descend
from the polar circle left deep impression of terror on the Imperial
city. By the vulgar of every rank, it was asserted and believed, that an
equestrian statue in the square of Taurus was secretly inscribed with a
prophecy, how the Russians, in the last days, should become masters of
Constantinople. <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> In our own time, a Russian armament, instead of
sailing from the Borysthenes, has circumnavigated the continent of
Europe; and the Turkish capital has been threatened by a squadron of
strong and lofty ships of war, each of which, with its naval science
and thundering artillery, could have sunk or scattered a hundred canoes,
such as those of their ancestors. Perhaps the present generation may yet
behold the accomplishment of the prediction, of a rare prediction, of
which the style is unambiguous and the date unquestionable.

By land the Russians were less formidable than by sea; and as they
fought for the most part on foot, their irregular legions must often
have been broken and overthrown by the cavalry of the Scythian hordes.
Yet their growing towns, however slight and imperfect, presented a
shelter to the subject, and a barrier to the enemy: the monarchy of
Kiow, till a fatal partition, assumed the dominion of the North; and
the nations from the Volga to the Danube were subdued or repelled by the
arms of Swatoslaus, <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> the son of Igor, the son of Oleg, the son of
Ruric. The vigor of his mind and body was fortified by the hardships of
a military and savage life. Wrapped in a bear-skin, Swatoslaus usually
slept on the ground, his head reclining on a saddle; his diet was coarse
and frugal, and, like the heroes of Homer, <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> his meat (it was often
horse-flesh) was broiled or roasted on the coals. The exercise of war
gave stability and discipline to his army; and it may be presumed, that
no soldier was permitted to transcend the luxury of his chief. By an
embassy from Nicephorus, the Greek emperor, he was moved to undertake
the conquest of Bulgaria; and a gift of fifteen hundred pounds of gold
was laid at his feet to defray the expense, or reward the toils, of the
expedition. An army of sixty thousand men was assembled and embarked;
they sailed from the Borysthenes to the Danube; their landing was
effected on the Maesian shore; and, after a sharp encounter, the swords
of the Russians prevailed against the arrows of the Bulgarian horse. The
vanquished king sunk into the grave; his children were made captive; and
his dominions, as far as Mount Haemus, were subdued or ravaged by the
northern invaders. But instead of relinquishing his prey, and performing
his engagements, the Varangian prince was more disposed to advance than
to retire; and, had his ambition been crowned with success, the seat
of empire in that early period might have been transferred to a more
temperate and fruitful climate. Swatoslaus enjoyed and acknowledged the
advantages of his new position, in which he could unite, by exchange or
rapine, the various productions of the earth. By an easy navigation
he might draw from Russia the native commodities of furs, wax, and
hydromed: Hungary supplied him with a breed of horses and the spoils
of the West; and Greece abounded with gold, silver, and the foreign
luxuries, which his poverty had affected to disdain. The bands of
Patzinacites, Chozars, and Turks, repaired to the standard of victory;
and the ambassador of Nicephorus betrayed his trust, assumed the purple,
and promised to share with his new allies the treasures of the Eastern
world. From the banks of the Danube the Russian prince pursued his march
as far as Adrianople; a formal summons to evacuate the Roman province
was dismissed with contempt; and Swatoslaus fiercely replied, that
Constantinople might soon expect the presence of an enemy and a master.

Nicephorus could no longer expel the mischief which he had introduced;
but his throne and wife were inherited by John Zimisces, <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> who, in a
diminutive body, possessed the spirit and abilities of a hero. The
first victory of his lieutenants deprived the Russians of their foreign
allies, twenty thousand of whom were either destroyed by the sword,
or provoked to revolt, or tempted to desert. Thrace was delivered, but
seventy thousand Barbarians were still in arms; and the legions that had
been recalled from the new conquests of Syria, prepared, with the return
of the spring, to march under the banners of a warlike prince, who
declared himself the friend and avenger of the injured Bulgaria. The
passes of Mount Haemus had been left unguarded; they were instantly
occupied; the Roman vanguard was formed of the immortals, (a proud
imitation of the Persian style;) the emperor led the main body of ten
thousand five hundred foot; and the rest of his forces followed in slow
and cautious array, with the baggage and military engines. The first
exploit of Zimisces was the reduction of Marcianopolis, or Peristhlaba,
<a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> in two days; the trumpets sounded; the walls were scaled; eight
thousand five hundred Russians were put to the sword; and the sons of
the Bulgarian king were rescued from an ignominious prison, and invested
with a nominal diadem. After these repeated losses, Swatoslaus retired
to the strong post of Drista, on the banks of the Danube, and was
pursued by an enemy who alternately employed the arms of celerity and
delay. The Byzantine galleys ascended the river, the legions completed
a line of circumvallation; and the Russian prince was encompassed,
assaulted, and famished, in the fortifications of the camp and city.
Many deeds of valor were performed; several desperate sallies were
attempted; nor was it till after a siege of sixty-five days that
Swatoslaus yielded to his adverse fortune. The liberal terms which he
obtained announce the prudence of the victor, who respected the valor,
and apprehended the despair, of an unconquered mind. The great duke of
Russia bound himself, by solemn imprecations, to relinquish all hostile
designs; a safe passage was opened for his return; the liberty of trade
and navigation was restored; a measure of corn was distributed to each
of his soldiers; and the allowance of twenty-two thousand measures
attests the loss and the remnant of the Barbarians. After a painful
voyage, they again reached the mouth of the Borysthenes; but their
provisions were exhausted; the season was unfavorable; they passed
the winter on the ice; and, before they could prosecute their march,
Swatoslaus was surprised and oppressed by the neighboring tribes with
whom the Greeks entertained a perpetual and useful correspondence.
<a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> Far different was the return of Zimisces, who was received in his
capital like Camillus or Marius, the saviors of ancient Rome. But the
merit of the victory was attributed by the pious emperor to the mother
of God; and the image of the Virgin Mary, with the divine infant in her
arms, was placed on a triumphal car, adorned with the spoils of war,
and the ensigns of Bulgarian royalty. Zimisces made his public entry on
horseback; the diadem on his head, a crown of laurel in his hand; and
Constantinople was astonished to applaud the martial virtues of her
sovereign. <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a>

Photius of Constantinople, a patriarch, whose ambition was equal to his
curiosity, congratulates himself and the Greek church on the conversion
of the Russians. <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> Those fierce and bloody Barbarians had been
persuaded, by the voice of reason and religion, to acknowledge Jesus for
their God, the Christian missionaries for their teachers, and the Romans
for their friends and brethren. His triumph was transient and premature.
In the various fortune of their piratical adventures, some Russian
chiefs might allow themselves to be sprinkled with the waters of
baptism; and a Greek bishop, with the name of metropolitan, might
administer the sacraments in the church of Kiow, to a congregation of
slaves and natives. But the seed of the gospel was sown on a barren
soil: many were the apostates, the converts were few; and the baptism
of Olga may be fixed as the aera of Russian Christianity. <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> A female,
perhaps of the basest origin, who could revenge the death, and assume
the sceptre, of her husband Igor, must have been endowed with those
active virtues which command the fear and obedience of Barbarians. In
a moment of foreign and domestic peace, she sailed from Kiow to
Constantinople; and the emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus has
described, with minute diligence, the ceremonial of her reception in his
capital and palace. The steps, the titles, the salutations, the banquet,
the presents, were exquisitely adjusted to gratify the vanity of the
stranger, with due reverence to the superior majesty of the purple.
<a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> In the sacrament of baptism, she received the venerable name of the
empress Helena; and her conversion might be preceded or followed by her
uncle, two interpreters, sixteen damsels of a higher, and eighteen of
a lower rank, twenty-two domestics or ministers, and forty-four Russian
merchants, who composed the retinue of the great princess Olga. After
her return to Kiow and Novogorod, she firmly persisted in her new
religion; but her labors in the propagation of the gospel were not
crowned with success; and both her family and nation adhered with
obstinacy or indifference to the gods of their fathers. Her son
Swatoslaus was apprehensive of the scorn and ridicule of his companions;
and her grandson Wolodomir devoted his youthful zeal to multiply and
decorate the monuments of ancient worship. The savage deities of the
North were still propitiated with human sacrifices: in the choice of
the victim, a citizen was preferred to a stranger, a Christian to an
idolater; and the father, who defended his son from the sacerdotal
knife, was involved in the same doom by the rage of a fanatic tumult.
Yet the lessons and example of the pious Olga had made a deep, though
secret, impression in the minds of the prince and people: the Greek
missionaries continued to preach, to dispute, and to baptize: and the
ambassadors or merchants of Russia compared the idolatry of the woods
with the elegant superstition of Constantinople. They had gazed with
admiration on the dome of St. Sophia: the lively pictures of saints
and martyrs, the riches of the altar, the number and vestments of the
priests, the pomp and order of the ceremonies; they were edified by the
alternate succession of devout silence and harmonious song; nor was it
difficult to persuade them, that a choir of angels descended each day
from heaven to join in the devotion of the Christians. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a> But the
conversion of Wolodomir was determined, or hastened, by his desire of a
Roman bride. At the same time, and in the city of Cherson, the rites of
baptism and marriage were celebrated by the Christian pontiff: the city
he restored to the emperor Basil, the brother of his spouse; but the
brazen gates were transported, as it is said, to Novogorod, and erected
before the first church as a trophy of his victory and faith. <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> At
his despotic command, Peround, the god of thunder, whom he had so long
adored, was dragged through the streets of Kiow; and twelve sturdy
Barbarians battered with clubs the misshapen image, which was
indignantly cast into the waters of the Borysthenes. The edict of
Wolodomir had proclaimed, that all who should refuse the rites of
baptism would be treated as the enemies of God and their prince; and the
rivers were instantly filled with many thousands of obedient Russians,
who acquiesced in the truth and excellence of a doctrine which had been
embraced by the great duke and his boyars. In the next generation, the
relics of Paganism were finally extirpated; but as the two brothers
of Wolodomir had died without baptism, their bones were taken from the
grave, and sanctified by an irregular and posthumous sacrament.

<p>
In the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries of the Christian aera,
the reign of the gospel and of the church was extended over Bulgaria,
Hungary, Bohemia, Saxony, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, and Russia.
<a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> The triumphs of apostolic zeal were repeated in the iron age of
Christianity; and the northern and eastern regions of Europe submitted
to a religion, more different in theory than in practice, from the
worship of their native idols. A laudable ambition excited the
monks both of Germany and Greece, to visit the tents and huts of the
Barbarians: poverty, hardships, and dangers, were the lot of the first
missionaries; their courage was active and patient; their motive pure
and meritorious; their present reward consisted in the testimony of
their conscience and the respect of a grateful people; but the fruitful
harvest of their toils was inherited and enjoyed by the proud and
wealthy prelates of succeeding times. The first conversions were free
and spontaneous: a holy life and an eloquent tongue were the only arms
of the missionaries; but the domestic fables of the Pagans were silenced
by the miracles and visions of the strangers; and the favorable temper
of the chiefs was accelerated by the dictates of vanity and interest.
The leaders of nations, who were saluted with the titles of kings and
saints, <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> held it lawful and pious to impose the Catholic faith on
their subjects and neighbors; the coast of the Baltic, from Holstein to
the Gulf of Finland, was invaded under the standard of the cross; and
the reign of idolatry was closed by the conversion of Lithuania in the
fourteenth century. Yet truth and candor must acknowledge, that the
conversion of the North imparted many temporal benefits both to the old
and the new Christians. The rage of war, inherent to the human species,
could not be healed by the evangelic precepts of charity and peace; and
the ambition of Catholic princes has renewed in every age the calamities
of hostile contention. But the admission of the Barbarians into the
pale of civil and ecclesiastical society delivered Europe from the
depredations, by sea and land, of the Normans, the Hungarians, and
the Russians, who learned to spare their brethren and cultivate their
possessions. <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> The establishment of law and order was promoted by
the influence of the clergy; and the rudiments of art and science were
introduced into the savage countries of the globe. The liberal piety
of the Russian princes engaged in their service the most skilful of the
Greeks, to decorate the cities and instruct the inhabitants: the dome
and the paintings of St. Sophia were rudely copied in the churches of
Kiow and Novogorod: the writings of the fathers were translated into
the Sclavonic idiom; and three hundred noble youths were invited or
compelled to attend the lessons of the college of Jaroslaus. It should
appear that Russia might have derived an early and rapid improvement
from her peculiar connection with the church and state of
Constantinople, which at that age so justly despised the ignorance of
the Latins. But the Byzantine nation was servile, solitary, and verging
to a hasty decline: after the fall of Kiow, the navigation of the
Borysthenes was forgotten; the great princes of Wolodomir and Moscow
were separated from the sea and Christendom; and the divided monarchy
was oppressed by the ignominy and blindness of Tartar servitude. <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a>
The Sclavonic and Scandinavian kingdoms, which had been converted by
the Latin missionaries, were exposed, it is true, to the spiritual
jurisdiction and temporal claims of the popes; <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a> but they were united
in language and religious worship, with each other, and with Rome;
they imbibed the free and generous spirit of the European republic,
and gradually shared the light of knowledge which arose on the western
world.
