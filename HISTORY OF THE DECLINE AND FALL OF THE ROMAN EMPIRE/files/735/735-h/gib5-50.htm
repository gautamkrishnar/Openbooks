After pursuing above six hundred years the fleeting Caesars of
Constantinople and Germany, I now descend, in the reign of Heraclius, on
the eastern borders of the Greek monarchy. While the state was exhausted
by the Persian war, and the church was distracted by the Nestorian and
Monophysite sects, Mahomet, with the sword in one hand and the Koran in
the other, erected his throne on the ruins of Christianity and of Rome.
The genius of the Arabian prophet, the manners of his nation, and the
spirit of his religion, involve the causes of the decline and fall of
the Eastern empire; and our eyes are curiously intent on one of the most
memorable revolutions, which have impressed a new and lasting character
on the nations of the globe. <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a>

[ As in this and the following chapter I shall display much
Arabic learning, I must profess my total ignorance of the Oriental
tongues, and my gratitude to the learned interpreters, who have
transfused their science into the Latin, French, and English languages.
Their collections, versions, and histories, I shall occasionally
notice.]
</p>
<p>
In the vacant space between Persia, Syria, Egypt, and Aethiopia, the
Arabian peninsula <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> may be conceived as a triangle of spacious but
irregular dimensions. From the northern point of Beles <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> on the
Euphrates, a line of fifteen hundred miles is terminated by the Straits
of Bebelmandel and the land of frankincense. About half this length may
be allowed for the middle breadth, from east to west, from Bassora
to Suez, from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> The sides of the
triangle are gradually enlarged, and the southern basis presents a
front of a thousand miles to the Indian Ocean. The entire surface of the
peninsula exceeds in a fourfold proportion that of Germany or France;
but the far greater part has been justly stigmatized with the epithets
of the stony and the sandy. Even the wilds of Tartary are decked, by the
hand of nature, with lofty trees and luxuriant herbage; and the lonesome
traveller derives a sort of comfort and society from the presence of
vegetable life. But in the dreary waste of Arabia, a boundless level of
sand is intersected by sharp and naked mountains; and the face of the
desert, without shade or shelter, is scorched by the direct and intense
rays of a tropical sun. Instead of refreshing breezes, the winds,
particularly from the south-west, diffuse a noxious and even deadly
vapor; the hillocks of sand which they alternately raise and scatter,
are compared to the billows of the ocean, and whole caravans, whole
armies, have been lost and buried in the whirlwind. The common benefits
of water are an object of desire and contest; and such is the scarcity
of wood, that some art is requisite to preserve and propagate the
element of fire. Arabia is destitute of navigable rivers, which
fertilize the soil, and convey its produce to the adjacent regions: the
torrents that fall from the hills are imbibed by the thirsty earth: the
rare and hardy plants, the tamarind or the acacia, that strike their
roots into the clefts of the rocks, are nourished by the dews of the
night: a scanty supply of rain is collected in cisterns and aqueducts:
the wells and springs are the secret treasure of the desert; and the
pilgrim of Mecca, <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> after many a dry and sultry march, is disgusted by
the taste of the waters which have rolled over a bed of sulphur or salt.
Such is the general and genuine picture of the climate of Arabia.
The experience of evil enhances the value of any local or partial
enjoyments. A shady grove, a green pasture, a stream of fresh water, are
sufficient to attract a colony of sedentary Arabs to the fortunate spots
which can afford food and refreshment to themselves and their cattle,
and which encourage their industry in the cultivation of the palmtree
and the vine. The high lands that border on the Indian Ocean are
distinguished by their superior plenty of wood and water; the air is
more temperate, the fruits are more delicious, the animals and the human
race more numerous: the fertility of the soil invites and rewards the
toil of the husbandman; and the peculiar gifts of frankincense <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> and
coffee have attracted in different ages the merchants of the world. If
it be compared with the rest of the peninsula, this sequestered region
may truly deserve the appellation of the happy; and the splendid
coloring of fancy and fiction has been suggested by contrast, and
countenanced by distance. It was for this earthly paradise that Nature
had reserved her choicest favors and her most curious workmanship: the
incompatible blessings of luxury and innocence were ascribed to the
natives: the soil was impregnated with gold <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> and gems, and both the
land and sea were taught to exhale the odors of aromatic sweets. This
division of the sandy, the stony, and the happy, so familiar to the
Greeks and Latins, is unknown to the Arabians themselves; and it is
singular enough, that a country, whose language and inhabitants have
ever been the same, should scarcely retain a vestige of its ancient
geography. The maritime districts of Bahrein and Oman are opposite to
the realm of Persia. The kingdom of Yemen displays the limits, or at
least the situation, of Arabia Felix: the name of Neged is extended over
the inland space; and the birth of Mahomet has illustrated the province
of Hejaz along the coast of the Red Sea. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a>

[ The geographers of Arabia may be divided into three
classes: 1. The Greeks and Latins, whose progressive knowledge may be
traced in Agatharcides, (de Mari Rubro, in Hudson, Geograph. Minor. tom.
i.,) Diodorus Siculus, (tom. i. l. ii. p. 159-167, l. iii. p. 211-216,
edit. Wesseling,) Strabo, (l. xvi. p. 1112-1114, from Eratosthenes, p.
1122-1132, from Artemidorus,) Dionysius, (Periegesis, 927-969,) Pliny,
(Hist. Natur. v. 12, vi. 32,) and Ptolemy, (Descript. et Tabulae Urbium,
in Hudson, tom. iii.) 2. The Arabic writers, who have treated the
subject with the zeal of patriotism or devotion: the extracts of Pocock
(Specimen Hist. Arabum, p. 125-128) from the Geography of the Sherif
al Edrissi, render us still more dissatisfied with the version or
abridgment (p. 24-27, 44-56, 108, &amp;c., 119, &amp;c.) which the Maronites
have published under the absurd title of Geographia Nubiensis, (Paris,
1619;) but the Latin and French translators, Greaves (in Hudson, tom.
iii.) and Galland, (Voyage de la Palestine par La Roque, p. 265-346,)
have opened to us the Arabia of Abulfeda, the most copious and correct
account of the peninsula, which may be enriched, however, from the
Bibliotheque Orientale of D'Herbelot, p. 120, et alibi passim. 3.
The European travellers; among whom Shaw (p. 438-455) and Niebuhr
(Description, 1773; Voyages, tom. i. 1776) deserve an honorable
distinction: Busching (Geographie par Berenger, tom. viii. p. 416-510)
has compiled with judgment, and D'Anville's Maps (Orbis Veteribus
Notus, and 1re Partie de l'Asie) should lie before the reader, with his
Geographie Ancienne, tom. ii. p. 208-231. * Note: Of modern travellers
may be mentioned the adventurer who called himself Ali Bey; but above
all, the intelligent, the enterprising the accurate Burckhardt.&mdash;M.]

from the size of an olive to that of a nut; that iron was twice, and
silver ten times, the value of gold, (de Mari Rubro, p. 60.) These real
or imaginary treasures are vanished; and no gold mines are at present
known in Arabia, (Niebuhr, Description, p. 124.) * Note: A brilliant
passage in the geographical poem of Dionysius Periegetes embodies the
notions of the ancients on the wealth and fertility of Yemen. Greek
mythology, and the traditions of the "gorgeous east," of India as well
as Arabia, are mingled together in indiscriminate splendor. Compare on
the southern coast of Arabia, the recent travels of Lieut. Wellsted&mdash;M.]

fifty-eight notes form a classic and original work on the Arabian
antiquities.]
</p>
<p>
The measure of population is regulated by the means of subsistence;
and the inhabitants of this vast peninsula might be outnumbered by the
subjects of a fertile and industrious province. Along the shores of the
Persian Gulf, of the ocean, and even of the Red Sea, the Icthyophagi,
<a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> or fish eaters, continued to wander in quest of their precarious
food. In this primitive and abject state, which ill deserves the name of
society, the human brute, without arts or laws, almost without sense or
language, is poorly distinguished from the rest of the animal creation.
Generations and ages might roll away in silent oblivion, and the
helpless savage was restrained from multiplying his race by the wants
and pursuits which confined his existence to the narrow margin of the
seacoast. But in an early period of antiquity the great body of the
Arabs had emerged from this scene of misery; and as the naked wilderness
could not maintain a people of hunters, they rose at once to the more
secure and plentiful condition of the pastoral life. The same life
is uniformly pursued by the roving tribes of the desert; and in the
portrait of the modern Bedoweens, we may trace the features of their
ancestors, <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> who, in the age of Moses or Mahomet, dwelt under similar
tents, and conducted their horses, and camels, and sheep, to the same
springs and the same pastures. Our toil is lessened, and our wealth
is increased, by our dominion over the useful animals; and the Arabian
shepherd had acquired the absolute possession of a faithful friend and
a laborious slave. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> Arabia, in the opinion of the naturalist, is the
genuine and original country of the horse; the climate most propitious,
not indeed to the size, but to the spirit and swiftness, of that
generous animal. The merit of the Barb, the Spanish, and the English
breed, is derived from a mixture of Arabian blood: <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> the Bedoweens
preserve, with superstitious care, the honors and the memory of the
purest race: the males are sold at a high price, but the females are
seldom alienated; and the birth of a noble foal was esteemed among the
tribes, as a subject of joy and mutual congratulation. These horses are
educated in the tents, among the children of the Arabs, with a
tender familiarity, which trains them in the habits of gentleness
and attachment. They are accustomed only to walk and to gallop: their
sensations are not blunted by the incessant abuse of the spur and the
whip: their powers are reserved for the moments of flight and pursuit:
but no sooner do they feel the touch of the hand or the stirrup, than
they dart away with the swiftness of the wind; and if their friend
be dismounted in the rapid career, they instantly stop till he has
recovered his seat. In the sands of Africa and Arabia, the camel is a
sacred and precious gift. That strong and patient beast of burden can
perform, without eating or drinking, a journey of several days; and a
reservoir of fresh water is preserved in a large bag, a fifth stomach
of the animal, whose body is imprinted with the marks of servitude: the
larger breed is capable of transporting a weight of a thousand pounds;
and the dromedary, of a lighter and more active frame, outstrips the
fleetest courser in the race. Alive or dead, almost every part of the
camel is serviceable to man: her milk is plentiful and nutritious: the
young and tender flesh has the taste of veal: <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> a valuable salt is
extracted from the urine: the dung supplies the deficiency of fuel;
and the long hair, which falls each year and is renewed, is coarsely
manufactured into the garments, the furniture, and the tents of the
Bedoweens. In the rainy seasons, they consume the rare and insufficient
herbage of the desert: during the heats of summer and the scarcity of
winter, they remove their encampments to the sea-coast, the hills of
Yemen, or the neighborhood of the Euphrates, and have often extorted the
dangerous license of visiting the banks of the Nile, and the villages
of Syria and Palestine. The life of a wandering Arab is a life of
danger and distress; and though sometimes, by rapine or exchange, he may
appropriate the fruits of industry, a private citizen in Europe is in
the possession of more solid and pleasing luxury than the proudest emir,
who marches in the field at the head of ten thousand horse.

probable that the shores of the Red Sea (in the largest sense) were
occupied by these savages in the time, perhaps, of Cyrus; but I can
hardly believe that any cannibals were left among the savages in the
reign of Justinian. (Procop. de Bell. Persic. l. i. c. 19.)]

Neged were esteemed sure-footed, those of Yemen strong and serviceable,
those of Hejaz most noble. The horses of Europe, the tenth and last
class, were generally despised as having too much body and too little
spirit, (D'Herbelot, Bibliot. Orient. p. 339: ) their strength was
requisite to bear the weight of the knight and his armor]

[ Qui carnibus camelorum vesci solent odii tenaces sunt, was
the opinion of an Arabian physician, (Pocock, Specimen, p. 88.) Mahomet
himself, who was fond of milk, prefers the cow, and does not even
mention the camel; but the diet of Mecca and Medina was already more
luxurious, (Gagnier Vie de Mahomet, tom. iii. p. 404.)]
</p>
<p>
Yet an essential difference may be found between the hordes of Scythia
and the Arabian tribes; since many of the latter were collected into
towns, and employed in the labors of trade and agriculture. A part of
their time and industry was still devoted to the management of their
cattle: they mingled, in peace and war, with their brethren of the
desert; and the Bedoweens derived from their useful intercourse some
supply of their wants, and some rudiments of art and knowledge. Among
the forty-two cities of Arabia, <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> enumerated by Abulfeda, the most
ancient and populous were situate in the happy Yemen: the towers of
Saana, <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> and the marvellous reservoir of Merab, <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> were constructed
by the kings of the Homerites; but their profane lustre was eclipsed by
the prophetic glories of Medina <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> and Mecca, <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> near the Red Sea,
and at the distance from each other of two hundred and seventy miles.
The last of these holy places was known to the Greeks under the name
of Macoraba; and the termination of the word is expressive of its
greatness, which has not, indeed, in the most flourishing period,
exceeded the size and populousness of Marseilles. Some latent motive,
perhaps of superstition, must have impelled the founders, in the choice
of a most unpromising situation. They erected their habitations of mud
or stone, in a plain about two miles long and one mile broad, at the
foot of three barren mountains: the soil is a rock; the water even of
the holy well of Zemzem is bitter or brackish; the pastures are remote
from the city; and grapes are transported above seventy miles from the
gardens of Tayef. The fame and spirit of the Koreishites, who reigned in
Mecca, were conspicuous among the Arabian tribes; but their ungrateful
soil refused the labors of agriculture, and their position was favorable
to the enterprises of trade. By the seaport of Gedda, at the distance
only of forty miles, they maintained an easy correspondence with
Abyssinia; and that Christian kingdom afforded the first refuge to the
disciples of Mahomet. The treasures of Africa were conveyed over the
Peninsula to Gerrha or Katif, in the province of Bahrein, a city built,
as it is said, of rock-salt, by the Chaldaean exiles; <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> and from
thence with the native pearls of the Persian Gulf, they were floated on
rafts to the mouth of the Euphrates. Mecca is placed almost at an equal
distance, a month's journey, between Yemen on the right, and Syria on
the left hand. The former was the winter, the latter the summer, station
of her caravans; and their seasonable arrival relieved the ships of
India from the tedious and troublesome navigation of the Red Sea. In the
markets of Saana and Merab, in the harbors of Oman and Aden, the camels
of the Koreishites were laden with a precious cargo of aromatics; a
supply of corn and manufactures was purchased in the fairs of Bostra
and Damascus; the lucrative exchange diffused plenty and riches in the
streets of Mecca; and the noblest of her sons united the love of arms
with the profession of merchandise. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a>

The perpetual independence of the Arabs has been the theme of praise
among strangers and natives; and the arts of controversy transform this
singular event into a prophecy and a miracle, in favor of the posterity
of Ismael. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> Some exceptions, that can neither be dismissed
nor eluded, render this mode of reasoning as indiscreet as it is
superfluous; the kingdom of Yemen has been successively subdued by the
Abyssinians, the Persians, the sultans of Egypt, <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> and the Turks;
<a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> the holy cities of Mecca and Medina have repeatedly bowed under
a Scythian tyrant; and the Roman province of Arabia <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> embraced the
peculiar wilderness in which Ismael and his sons must have pitched their
tents in the face of their brethren. Yet these exceptions are temporary
or local; the body of the nation has escaped the yoke of the most
powerful monarchies: the arms of Sesostris and Cyrus, of Pompey
and Trajan, could never achieve the conquest of Arabia; the present
sovereign of the Turks <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> may exercise a shadow of jurisdiction, but
his pride is reduced to solicit the friendship of a people, whom it is
dangerous to provoke, and fruitless to attack. The obvious causes of
their freedom are inscribed on the character and country of the Arabs.
Many ages before Mahomet, <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> their intrepid valor had been severely
felt by their neighbors in offensive and defensive war. The patient
and active virtues of a soldier are insensibly nursed in the habits
and discipline of a pastoral life. The care of the sheep and camels is
abandoned to the women of the tribe; but the martial youth, under the
banner of the emir, is ever on horseback, and in the field, to practise
the exercise of the bow, the javelin, and the cimeter. The long memory
of their independence is the firmest pledge of its perpetuity and
succeeding generations are animated to prove their descent, and to
maintain their inheritance. Their domestic feuds are suspended on the
approach of a common enemy; and in their last hostilities against the
Turks, the caravan of Mecca was attacked and pillaged by fourscore
thousand of the confederates. When they advance to battle, the hope of
victory is in the front; in the rear, the assurance of a retreat. Their
horses and camels, who, in eight or ten days, can perform a march of
four or five hundred miles, disappear before the conqueror; the secret
waters of the desert elude his search, and his victorious troops
are consumed with thirst, hunger, and fatigue, in the pursuit of an
invisible foe, who scorns his efforts, and safely reposes in the heart
of the burning solitude. The arms and deserts of the Bedoweens are not
only the safeguards of their own freedom, but the barriers also of the
happy Arabia, whose inhabitants, remote from war, are enervated by the
luxury of the soil and climate. The legions of Augustus melted away in
disease and lassitude; <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> and it is only by a naval power that the
reduction of Yemen has been successfully attempted. When Mahomet erected
his holy standard, <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> that kingdom was a province of the Persian
empire; yet seven princes of the Homerites still reigned in the
mountains; and the vicegerent of Chosroes was tempted to forget his
distant country and his unfortunate master. The historians of the age of
Justinian represent the state of the independent Arabs, who were divided
by interest or affection in the long quarrel of the East: the tribe of
Gassan was allowed to encamp on the Syrian territory: the princes of
Hira were permitted to form a city about forty miles to the southward
of the ruins of Babylon. Their service in the field was speedy and
vigorous; but their friendship was venal, their faith inconstant, their
enmity capricious: it was an easier task to excite than to disarm these
roving barbarians; and, in the familiar intercourse of war, they learned
to see, and to despise, the splendid weakness both of Rome and of
Persia. From Mecca to the Euphrates, the Arabian tribes <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> were
confounded by the Greeks and Latins, under the general appellation of
Saracens, <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> a name which every Christian mouth has been taught to
pronounce with terror and abhorrence.

position of the Saracens, then an obscure tribe on the borders of Egypt.

since it was imposed by strangers, it must be found, not in the Arabic,
but in a foreign language. * Note: Dr. Clarke, (Travels, vol. ii. p.

    Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
The slaves of domestic tyranny may vainly exult in their national
independence: but the Arab is personally free; and he enjoys, in some
degree, the benefits of society, without forfeiting the prerogatives
of nature. In every tribe, superstition, or gratitude, or fortune,
has exalted a particular family above the heads of their equals. The
dignities of sheick and emir invariably descend in this chosen race; but
the order of succession is loose and precarious; and the most worthy or
aged of the noble kinsmen are preferred to the simple, though important,
office of composing disputes by their advice, and guiding valor by their
example. Even a female of sense and spirit has been permitted to command
the countrymen of Zenobia. <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> The momentary junction of several tribes
produces an army: their more lasting union constitutes a nation; and
the supreme chief, the emir of emirs, whose banner is displayed at their
head, may deserve, in the eyes of strangers, the honors of the kingly
name.
</p>
<p>
If the Arabian princes abuse their power, they are quickly punished by
the desertion of their subjects, who had been accustomed to a mild and
parental jurisdiction. Their spirit is free, their steps are unconfined,
the desert is open, and the tribes and families are held together by a
mutual and voluntary compact. The softer natives of Yemen supported
the pomp and majesty of a monarch; but if he could not leave his palace
without endangering his life, <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> the active powers of government must
have been devolved on his nobles and magistrates. The cities of Mecca
and Medina present, in the heart of Asia, the form, or rather the
substance, of a commonwealth. The grandfather of Mahomet, and his lineal
ancestors, appear in foreign and domestic transactions as the princes of
their country; but they reigned, like Pericles at Athens, or the
Medici at Florence, by the opinion of their wisdom and integrity;
their influence was divided with their patrimony; and the sceptre was
transferred from the uncles of the prophet to a younger branch of the
tribe of Koreish. On solemn occasions they convened the assembly of
the people; and, since mankind must be either compelled or persuaded to
obey, the use and reputation of oratory among the ancient Arabs is the
clearest evidence of public freedom. <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> But their simple freedom was
of a very different cast from the nice and artificial machinery of the
Greek and Roman republics, in which each member possessed an undivided
share of the civil and political rights of the community. In the more
simple state of the Arabs, the nation is free, because each of her
sons disdains a base submission to the will of a master. His breast is
fortified by the austere virtues of courage, patience, and sobriety; the
love of independence prompts him to exercise the habits of self-command;
and the fear of dishonor guards him from the meaner apprehension of
pain, of danger, and of death. The gravity and firmness of the mind is
conspicuous in his outward demeanor; his speech is low, weighty, and
concise; he is seldom provoked to laughter; his only gesture is that of
stroking his beard, the venerable symbol of manhood; and the sense of
his own importance teaches him to accost his equals without levity, and
his superiors without awe. <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> The liberty of the Saracens survived
their conquests: the first caliphs indulged the bold and familiar
language of their subjects; they ascended the pulpit to persuade and
edify the congregation; nor was it before the seat of empire was
removed to the Tigris, that the Abbasides adopted the proud and pompous
ceremonial of the Persian and Byzantine courts.

</p>
<p>
In the study of nations and men, we may observe the causes that render
them hostile or friendly to each other, that tend to narrow or enlarge,
to mollify or exasperate, the social character. The separation of the
Arabs from the rest of mankind has accustomed them to confound the ideas
of stranger and enemy; and the poverty of the land has introduced a
maxim of jurisprudence, which they believe and practise to the present
hour. They pretend, that, in the division of the earth, the rich and
fertile climates were assigned to the other branches of the human
family; and that the posterity of the outlaw Ismael might recover, by
fraud or force, the portion of inheritance of which he had been unjustly
deprived. According to the remark of Pliny, the Arabian tribes are
equally addicted to theft and merchandise; the caravans that traverse
the desert are ransomed or pillaged; and their neighbors, since the
remote times of Job and Sesostris, <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> have been the victims of
their rapacious spirit. If a Bedoween discovers from afar a solitary
traveller, he rides furiously against him, crying, with a loud voice,
"Undress thyself, thy aunt (my wife) is without a garment." A ready
submission entitles him to mercy; resistance will provoke the aggressor,
and his own blood must expiate the blood which he presumes to shed in
legitimate defence. A single robber, or a few associates, are branded
with their genuine name; but the exploits of a numerous band assume the
character of lawful and honorable war. The temper of a people thus armed
against mankind was doubly inflamed by the domestic license of rapine,
murder, and revenge. In the constitution of Europe, the right of peace
and war is now confined to a small, and the actual exercise to a much
smaller, list of respectable potentates; but each Arab, with impunity
and renown, might point his javelin against the life of his countrymen.
The union of the nation consisted only in a vague resemblance of
language and manners; and in each community, the jurisdiction of
the magistrate was mute and impotent. Of the time of ignorance which
preceded Mahomet, seventeen hundred battles <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> are recorded by
tradition: hostility was imbittered with the rancor of civil faction;
and the recital, in prose or verse, of an obsolete feud, was sufficient
to rekindle the same passions among the descendants of the hostile
tribes. In private life every man, at least every family, was the judge
and avenger of his own cause. The nice sensibility of honor, which
weighs the insult rather than the injury, sheds its deadly venom on the
quarrels of the Arabs: the honor of their women, and of their beards,
is most easily wounded; an indecent action, a contemptuous word, can be
expiated only by the blood of the offender; and such is their patient
inveteracy, that they expect whole months and years the opportunity of
revenge. A fine or compensation for murder is familiar to the Barbarians
of every age: but in Arabia the kinsmen of the dead are at liberty to
accept the atonement, or to exercise with their own hands the law of
retaliation. The refined malice of the Arabs refuses even the head
of the murderer, substitutes an innocent for the guilty person, and
transfers the penalty to the best and most considerable of the race
by whom they have been injured. If he falls by their hands, they are
exposed, in their turn, to the danger of reprisals, the interest and
principal of the bloody debt are accumulated: the individuals of
either family lead a life of malice and suspicion, and fifty years may
sometimes elapse before the account of vengeance be finally settled.
<a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> This sanguinary spirit, ignorant of pity or forgiveness, has been
moderated, however, by the maxims of honor, which require in every
private encounter some decent equality of age and strength, of numbers
and weapons. An annual festival of two, perhaps of four, months, was
observed by the Arabs before the time of Mahomet, during which their
swords were religiously sheathed both in foreign and domestic hostility;
and this partial truce is more strongly expressive of the habits of
anarchy and warfare. <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a>

But the spirit of rapine and revenge was attempered by the milder
influence of trade and literature. The solitary peninsula is encompassed
by the most civilized nations of the ancient world; the merchant is the
friend of mankind; and the annual caravans imported the first seeds
of knowledge and politeness into the cities, and even the camps of the
desert. Whatever may be the pedigree of the Arabs, their language is
derived from the same original stock with the Hebrew, the Syriac, and
the Chaldaean tongues; the independence of the tribes was marked by
their peculiar dialects; <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> but each, after their own, allowed a just
preference to the pure and perspicuous idiom of Mecca. In Arabia, as
well as in Greece, the perfection of language outstripped the refinement
of manners; and her speech could diversify the fourscore names of honey,
the two hundred of a serpent, the five hundred of a lion, the thousand
of a sword, at a time when this copious dictionary was intrusted to
the memory of an illiterate people. The monuments of the Homerites
were inscribed with an obsolete and mysterious character; but the Cufic
letters, the groundwork of the present alphabet, were invented on the
banks of the Euphrates; and the recent invention was taught at Mecca by
a stranger who settled in that city after the birth of Mahomet. The
arts of grammar, of metre, and of rhetoric, were unknown to the freeborn
eloquence of the Arabians; but their penetration was sharp, their
fancy luxuriant, their wit strong and sententious, <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> and their more
elaborate compositions were addressed with energy and effect to the
minds of their hearers. The genius and merit of a rising poet was
celebrated by the applause of his own and the kindred tribes. A solemn
banquet was prepared, and a chorus of women, striking their tymbals,
and displaying the pomp of their nuptials, sung in the presence of their
sons and husbands the felicity of their native tribe; that a champion
had now appeared to vindicate their rights; that a herald had raised
his voice to immortalize their renown. The distant or hostile tribes
resorted to an annual fair, which was abolished by the fanaticism of the
first Moslems; a national assembly that must have contributed to refine
and harmonize the Barbarians. Thirty days were employed in the exchange,
not only of corn and wine, but of eloquence and poetry. The prize
was disputed by the generous emulation of the bards; the victorious
performance was deposited in the archives of princes and emirs; and
we may read in our own language, the seven original poems which were
inscribed in letters of gold, and suspended in the temple of Mecca. <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a>
The Arabian poets were the historians and moralists of the age; and
if they sympathized with the prejudices, they inspired and crowned the
virtues, of their countrymen. The indissoluble union of generosity and
valor was the darling theme of their song; and when they pointed
their keenest satire against a despicable race, they affirmed, in the
bitterness of reproach, that the men knew not how to give, nor the women
to deny. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> The same hospitality, which was practised by Abraham, and
celebrated by Homer, is still renewed in the camps of the Arabs. The
ferocious Bedoweens, the terror of the desert, embrace, without inquiry
or hesitation, the stranger who dares to confide in their honor and to
enter their tent. His treatment is kind and respectful: he shares the
wealth, or the poverty, of his host; and, after a needful repose, he
is dismissed on his way, with thanks, with blessings, and perhaps with
gifts. The heart and hand are more largely expanded by the wants of a
brother or a friend; but the heroic acts that could deserve the public
applause, must have surpassed the narrow measure of discretion and
experience. A dispute had arisen, who, among the citizens of Mecca, was
entitled to the prize of generosity; and a successive application was
made to the three who were deemed most worthy of the trial. Abdallah,
the son of Abbas, had undertaken a distant journey, and his foot was in
the stirrup when he heard the voice of a suppliant, "O son of the uncle
of the apostle of God, I am a traveller, and in distress!" He instantly
dismounted to present the pilgrim with his camel, her rich caparison,
and a purse of four thousand pieces of gold, excepting only the sword,
either for its intrinsic value, or as the gift of an honored kinsman.
The servant of Kais informed the second suppliant that his master was
asleep: but he immediately added, "Here is a purse of seven thousand
pieces of gold, (it is all we have in the house,) and here is an order,
that will entitle you to a camel and a slave;" the master, as soon as
he awoke, praised and enfranchised his faithful steward, with a gentle
reproof, that by respecting his slumbers he had stinted his bounty.
The third of these heroes, the blind Arabah, at the hour of prayer, was
supporting his steps on the shoulders of two slaves. "Alas!" he replied,
"my coffers are empty! but these you may sell; if you refuse, I renounce
them." At these words, pushing away the youths, he groped along the wall
with his staff.
</p>
<p>
The character of Hatem is the perfect model of Arabian virtue: <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> he
was brave and liberal, an eloquent poet, and a successful robber; forty
camels were roasted at his hospitable feast; and at the prayer of a
suppliant enemy he restored both the captives and the spoil. The freedom
of his countrymen disdained the laws of justice; they proudly indulged
the spontaneous impulse of pity and benevolence.

<p>
The religion of the Arabs, <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> as well as of the Indians, consisted in
the worship of the sun, the moon, and the fixed stars; a primitive and
specious mode of superstition. The bright luminaries of the sky display
the visible image of a Deity: their number and distance convey to a
philosophic, or even a vulgar, eye, the idea of boundless space:
the character of eternity is marked on these solid globes, that seem
incapable of corruption or decay: the regularity of their motions may
be ascribed to a principle of reason or instinct; and their real, or
imaginary, influence encourages the vain belief that the earth and
its inhabitants are the object of their peculiar care. The science of
astronomy was cultivated at Babylon; but the school of the Arabs was
a clear firmament and a naked plain. In their nocturnal marches, they
steered by the guidance of the stars: their names, and order, and daily
station, were familiar to the curiosity and devotion of the Bedoween;
and he was taught by experience to divide, in twenty-eight parts, the
zodiac of the moon, and to bless the constellations who refreshed, with
salutary rains, the thirst of the desert. The reign of the heavenly orbs
could not be extended beyond the visible sphere; and some metaphysical
powers were necessary to sustain the transmigration of souls and the
resurrection of bodies: a camel was left to perish on the grave, that he
might serve his master in another life; and the invocation of departed
spirits implies that they were still endowed with consciousness and
power. I am ignorant, and I am careless, of the blind mythology of the
Barbarians; of the local deities, of the stars, the air, and the earth,
of their sex or titles, their attributes or subordination. Each tribe,
each family, each independent warrior, created and changed the rites and
the object of his fantastic worship; but the nation, in every age, has
bowed to the religion, as well as to the language, of Mecca. The genuine
antiquity of the Caaba ascends beyond the Christian aera; in describing
the coast of the Red Sea, the Greek historian Diodorus <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> has
remarked, between the Thamudites and the Sabaeans, a famous temple,
whose superior sanctity was revered by all the Arabians; the linen or
silken veil, which is annually renewed by the Turkish emperor, was first
offered by a pious king of the Homerites, who reigned seven hundred
years before the time of Mahomet. <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> A tent, or a cavern, might
suffice for the worship of the savages, but an edifice of stone and clay
has been erected in its place; and the art and power of the monarchs
of the East have been confined to the simplicity of the original model.
<a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> A spacious portico encloses the quadrangle of the Caaba; a square
chapel, twenty-four cubits long, twenty-three broad, and twenty-seven
high: a door and a window admit the light; the double roof is supported
by three pillars of wood; a spout (now of gold) discharges the
rain-water, and the well Zemzen is protected by a dome from accidental
pollution. The tribe of Koreish, by fraud and force, had acquired the
custody of the Caaba: the sacerdotal office devolved through four
lineal descents to the grandfather of Mahomet; and the family of the
Hashemites, from whence he sprung, was the most respectable and sacred
in the eyes of their country. <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> The precincts of Mecca enjoyed the
rights of sanctuary; and, in the last month of each year, the city and
the temple were crowded with a long train of pilgrims, who presented
their vows and offerings in the house of God. The same rites which are
now accomplished by the faithful Mussulman, were invented and practised
by the superstition of the idolaters. At an awful distance they cast
away their garments: seven times, with hasty steps, they encircled the
Caaba, and kissed the black stone: seven times they visited and adored
the adjacent mountains; seven times they threw stones into the valley
of Mina; and the pilgrimage was achieved, as at the present hour, by a
sacrifice of sheep and camels, and the burial of their hair and nails
in the consecrated ground. Each tribe either found or introduced in the
Caaba their domestic worship: the temple was adorned, or defiled, with
three hundred and sixty idols of men, eagles, lions, and antelopes; and
most conspicuous was the statue of Hebal, of red agate, holding in
his hand seven arrows, without heads or feathers, the instruments and
symbols of profane divination. But this statue was a monument of Syrian
arts: the devotion of the ruder ages was content with a pillar or a
tablet; and the rocks of the desert were hewn into gods or altars, in
imitation of the black stone <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> of Mecca, which is deeply tainted with
the reproach of an idolatrous origin. From Japan to Peru, the use of
sacrifice has universally prevailed; and the votary has expressed his
gratitude, or fear, by destroying or consuming, in honor of the gods,
the dearest and most precious of their gifts. The life of a man <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> is
the most precious oblation to deprecate a public calamity: the altars of
Phoenicia and Egypt, of Rome and Carthage, have been polluted with human
gore: the cruel practice was long preserved among the Arabs; in the
third century, a boy was annually sacrificed by the tribe of the
Dumatians; <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> and a royal captive was piously slaughtered by the
prince of the Saracens, the ally and soldier of the emperor Justinian.
<a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> A parent who drags his son to the altar, exhibits the most painful
and sublime effort of fanaticism: the deed, or the intention, was
sanctified by the example of saints and heroes; and the father of
Mahomet himself was devoted by a rash vow, and hardly ransomed for the
equivalent of a hundred camels. In the time of ignorance, the Arabs,
like the Jews and Egyptians, abstained from the taste of swine's flesh;
<a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> they circumcised <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> their children at the age of puberty: the
same customs, without the censure or the precept of the Koran, have
been silently transmitted to their posterity and proselytes. It has
been sagaciously conjectured, that the artful legislator indulged the
stubborn prejudices of his countrymen. It is more simple to believe that
he adhered to the habits and opinions of his youth, without foreseeing
that a practice congenial to the climate of Mecca might become useless
or inconvenient on the banks of the Danube or the Volga.

<h2>
    Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
Arabia was free: the adjacent kingdoms were shaken by the storms of
conquest and tyranny, and the persecuted sects fled to the happy land
where they might profess what they thought, and practise what they
professed. The religions of the Sabians and Magians, of the Jews and
Christians, were disseminated from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. In
a remote period of antiquity, Sabianism was diffused over Asia by the
science of the Chaldaeans <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> and the arms of the Assyrians. From
the observations of two thousand years, the priests and astronomers of
Babylon <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> deduced the eternal laws of nature and providence. They
adored the seven gods or angels, who directed the course of the seven
planets, and shed their irresistible influence on the earth. The
attributes of the seven planets, with the twelve signs of the zodiac,
and the twenty-four constellations of the northern and southern
hemisphere, were represented by images and talismans; the seven days of
the week were dedicated to their respective deities; the Sabians prayed
thrice each day; and the temple of the moon at Haran was the term of
their pilgrimage. <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> But the flexible genius of their faith was always
ready either to teach or to learn: in the tradition of the creation, the
deluge, and the patriarchs, they held a singular agreement with their
Jewish captives; they appealed to the secret books of Adam, Seth, and
Enoch; and a slight infusion of the gospel has transformed the last
remnant of the Polytheists into the Christians of St. John, in the
territory of Bassora. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> The altars of Babylon were overturned by the
Magians; but the injuries of the Sabians were revenged by the sword of
Alexander; Persia groaned above five hundred years under a foreign yoke;
and the purest disciples of Zoroaster escaped from the contagion of
idolatry, and breathed with their adversaries the freedom of the desert.
<a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> Seven hundred years before the death of Mahomet, the Jews were
settled in Arabia; and a far greater multitude was expelled from the
Holy Land in the wars of Titus and Hadrian. The industrious exiles
aspired to liberty and power: they erected synagogues in the cities, and
castles in the wilderness, and their Gentile converts were confounded
with the children of Israel, whom they resembled in the outward mark
of circumcision. The Christian missionaries were still more active and
successful: the Catholics asserted their universal reign; the sects
whom they oppressed, successively retired beyond the limits of the
Roman empire; the Marcionites and Manichaeans dispersed their fantastic
opinions and apocryphal gospels; the churches of Yemen, and the princes
of Hira and Gassan, were instructed in a purer creed by the Jacobite
and Nestorian bishops. <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> The liberty of choice was presented to the
tribes: each Arab was free to elect or to compose his private religion:
and the rude superstition of his house was mingled with the sublime
theology of saints and philosophers. A fundamental article of faith was
inculcated by the consent of the learned strangers; the existence of one
supreme God who is exalted above the powers of heaven and earth, but who
has often revealed himself to mankind by the ministry of his angels
and prophets, and whose grace or justice has interrupted, by seasonable
miracles, the order of nature. The most rational of the Arabs
acknowledged his power, though they neglected his worship; <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> and it
was habit rather than conviction that still attached them to the relics
of idolatry. The Jews and Christians were the people of the Book; the
Bible was already translated into the Arabic language, <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> and the
volume of the Old Testament was accepted by the concord of these
implacable enemies. In the story of the Hebrew patriarchs, the Arabs
were pleased to discover the fathers of their nation. They applauded the
birth and promises of Ismael; revered the faith and virtue of Abraham;
traced his pedigree and their own to the creation of the first man, and
imbibed, with equal credulity, the prodigies of the holy text, and the
dreams and traditions of the Jewish rabbis.

appear more recent than the Koran; but the existence of a prior
translation may be fairly inferred,&mdash;1. From the perpetual practice of
the synagogue of expounding the Hebrew lesson by a paraphrase in the

The base and plebeian origin of Mahomet is an unskilful calumny of
the Christians, <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> who exalt instead of degrading the merit of their
adversary. His descent from Ismael was a national privilege or fable;
but if the first steps of the pedigree <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> are dark and doubtful, he
could produce many generations of pure and genuine nobility: he sprung
from the tribe of Koreish and the family of Hashem, the most illustrious
of the Arabs, the princes of Mecca, and the hereditary guardians of the
Caaba. The grandfather of Mahomet was Abdol Motalleb, the son of Hashem,
a wealthy and generous citizen, who relieved the distress of famine with
the supplies of commerce. Mecca, which had been fed by the liberality
of the father, was saved by the courage of the son. The kingdom of Yemen
was subject to the Christian princes of Abyssinia; their vassal Abrahah
was provoked by an insult to avenge the honor of the cross; and the holy
city was invested by a train of elephants and an army of Africans. A
treaty was proposed; and, in the first audience, the grandfather of
Mahomet demanded the restitution of his cattle. "And why," said Abrahah,
"do you not rather implore my clemency in favor of your temple, which I
have threatened to destroy?" "Because," replied the intrepid chief, "the
cattle is my own; the Caaba belongs to the gods, and they will defend
their house from injury and sacrilege." The want of provisions, or
the valor of the Koreish, compelled the Abyssinians to a disgraceful
retreat: their discomfiture has been adorned with a miraculous flight
of birds, who showered down stones on the heads of the infidels; and the
deliverance was long commemorated by the aera of the elephant. <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> The
glory of Abdol Motalleb was crowned with domestic happiness; his life
was prolonged to the age of one hundred and ten years; and he became the
father of six daughters and thirteen sons. His best beloved Abdallah
was the most beautiful and modest of the Arabian youth; and in the first
night, when he consummated his marriage with Amina, <a href="#note-651" name="noteref-651"><small>651</small></a> of the noble
race of the Zahrites, two hundred virgins are said to have expired of
jealousy and despair. Mahomet, or more properly Mohammed, the only son
of Abdallah and Amina, was born at Mecca, four years after the death
of Justinian, and two months after the defeat of the Abyssinians, <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a>
whose victory would have introduced into the Caaba the religion of the
Christians. In his early infancy, he was deprived of his father, his
mother, and his grandfather; his uncles were strong and numerous; and,
in the division of the inheritance, the orphan's share was reduced to
five camels and an Aethiopian maid-servant. At home and abroad, in peace
and war, Abu Taleb, the most respectable of his uncles, was the guide
and guardian of his youth; in his twenty-fifth year, he entered into the
service of Cadijah, a rich and noble widow of Mecca, who soon rewarded
his fidelity with the gift of her hand and fortune. The marriage
contract, in the simple style of antiquity, recites the mutual love of
Mahomet and Cadijah; describes him as the most accomplished of the tribe
of Koreish; and stipulates a dowry of twelve ounces of gold and twenty
camels, which was supplied by the liberality of his uncle. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> By
this alliance, the son of Abdallah was restored to the station of
his ancestors; and the judicious matron was content with his domestic
virtues, till, in the fortieth year of his age, <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> he assumed the
title of a prophet, and proclaimed the religion of the Koran.

the Greeks, which is assigned by Elmacin (Hist. Saracen. p. 5) and

refine our chronology, it is possible that the illiterate prophet was
ignorant of his own age. * Note: The date of the birth of Mahomet is not
yet fixed with precision. It is only known from Oriental authors that
he was born on a Monday, the 10th Reby 1st, the third month of the
Mahometan year; the year 40 or 42 of Chosroes Nushirvan, king of Persia;
the year 881 of the Seleucidan aera; the year 1316 of the aera of

According to the tradition of his companions, Mahomet <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> was
distinguished by the beauty of his person, an outward gift which is
seldom despised, except by those to whom it has been refused. Before
he spoke, the orator engaged on his side the affections of a public or
private audience. They applauded his commanding presence, his majestic
aspect, his piercing eye, his gracious smile, his flowing beard, his
countenance that painted every sensation of the soul, and his gestures
that enforced each expression of the tongue. In the familiar offices of
life he scrupulously adhered to the grave and ceremonious politeness
of his country: his respectful attention to the rich and powerful was
dignified by his condescension and affability to the poorest citizens of
Mecca: the frankness of his manner concealed the artifice of his views;
and the habits of courtesy were imputed to personal friendship or
universal benevolence. His memory was capacious and retentive; his wit
easy and social; his imagination sublime; his judgment clear, rapid,
and decisive. He possessed the courage both of thought and action; and,
although his designs might gradually expand with his success, the first
idea which he entertained of his divine mission bears the stamp of an
original and superior genius. The son of Abdallah was educated in the
bosom of the noblest race, in the use of the purest dialect of Arabia;
and the fluency of his speech was corrected and enhanced by the practice
of discreet and seasonable silence. With these powers of eloquence,
Mahomet was an illiterate Barbarian: his youth had never been instructed
in the arts of reading and writing; <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> the common ignorance exempted
him from shame or reproach, but he was reduced to a narrow circle of
existence, and deprived of those faithful mirrors, which reflect to our
mind the minds of sages and heroes. Yet the book of nature and of man
was open to his view; and some fancy has been indulged in the political
and philosophical observations which are ascribed to the Arabian
traveller. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> He compares the nations and the regions of the earth;
discovers the weakness of the Persian and Roman monarchies; beholds,
with pity and indignation, the degeneracy of the times; and resolves
to unite under one God and one king the invincible spirit and primitive
virtues of the Arabs. Our more accurate inquiry will suggest, that,
instead of visiting the courts, the camps, the temples, of the East, the
two journeys of Mahomet into Syria were confined to the fairs of Bostra
and Damascus; that he was only thirteen years of age when he accompanied
the caravan of his uncle; and that his duty compelled him to return as
soon as he had disposed of the merchandise of Cadijah. In these hasty
and superficial excursions, the eye of genius might discern some objects
invisible to his grosser companions; some seeds of knowledge might be
cast upon a fruitful soil; but his ignorance of the Syriac language
must have checked his curiosity; and I cannot perceive, in the life
or writings of Mahomet, that his prospect was far extended beyond the
limits of the Arabian world. From every region of that solitary world,
the pilgrims of Mecca were annually assembled, by the calls of devotion
and commerce: in the free concourse of multitudes, a simple citizen, in
his native tongue, might study the political state and character of the
tribes, the theory and practice of the Jews and Christians. Some
useful strangers might be tempted, or forced, to implore the rights of
hospitality; and the enemies of Mahomet have named the Jew, the Persian,
and the Syrian monk, whom they accuse of lending their secret aid to the
composition of the Koran. <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> Conversation enriches the understanding,
but solitude is the school of genius; and the uniformity of a work
denotes the hand of a single artist. From his earliest youth Mahomet
was addicted to religious contemplation; each year, during the month of
Ramadan, he withdrew from the world, and from the arms of Cadijah: in
the cave of Hera, three miles from Mecca, <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> he consulted the spirit
of fraud or enthusiasm, whose abode is not in the heavens, but in
the mind of the prophet. The faith which, under the name of Islam, he
preached to his family and nation, is compounded of an eternal truth,
and a necessary fiction, That there is only one God, and that Mahomet is
the apostle of God.

imposture, of the prophet. His arguments are far from satisfactory. Two
short trading journeys to the fairs of Syria were surely not sufficient
to infuse a science so rare among the citizens of Mecca: it was not in
the cool, deliberate act of treaty, that Mahomet would have dropped
the mask; nor can any conclusion be drawn from the words of disease
and delirium. The lettered youth, before he aspired to the prophetic
character, must have often exercised, in private life, the arts of
reading and writing; and his first converts, of his own family, would
have been the first to detect and upbraid his scandalous hypocrisy,

It is the boast of the Jewish apologists, that while the learned nations
of antiquity were deluded by the fables of polytheism, their simple
ancestors of Palestine preserved the knowledge and worship of the true
God. The moral attributes of Jehovah may not easily be reconciled with
the standard of human virtue: his metaphysical qualities are darkly
expressed; but each page of the Pentateuch and the Prophets is an
evidence of his power: the unity of his name is inscribed on the first
table of the law; and his sanctuary was never defiled by any visible
image of the invisible essence. After the ruin of the temple, the
faith of the Hebrew exiles was purified, fixed, and enlightened, by the
spiritual devotion of the synagogue; and the authority of Mahomet will
not justify his perpetual reproach, that the Jews of Mecca or Medina
adored Ezra as the son of God. <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> But the children of Israel had
ceased to be a people; and the religions of the world were guilty,
at least in the eyes of the prophet, of giving sons, or daughters, or
companions, to the supreme God. In the rude idolatry of the Arabs, the
crime is manifest and audacious: the Sabians are poorly excused by the
preeminence of the first planet, or intelligence, in their celestial
hierarchy; and in the Magian system the conflict of the two principles
betrays the imperfection of the conqueror. The Christians of the seventh
century had insensibly relapsed into a semblance of Paganism: their
public and private vows were addressed to the relics and images that
disgraced the temples of the East: the throne of the Almighty was
darkened by a cloud of martyrs, and saints, and angels, the objects of
popular veneration; and the Collyridian heretics, who flourished in
the fruitful soil of Arabia, invested the Virgin Mary with the name and
honors of a goddess. <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> The mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation
appear to contradict the principle of the divine unity. In their obvious
sense, they introduce three equal deities, and transform the man Jesus
into the substance of the Son of God: <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a> an orthodox commentary will
satisfy only a believing mind: intemperate curiosity and zeal had torn
the veil of the sanctuary; and each of the Oriental sects was eager to
confess that all, except themselves, deserved the reproach of idolatry
and polytheism. The creed of Mahomet is free from suspicion or
ambiguity; and the Koran is a glorious testimony to the unity of God.
The prophet of Mecca rejected the worship of idols and men, of stars and
planets, on the rational principle that whatever rises must set, that
whatever is born must die, that whatever is corruptible must decay and
perish. <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> In the Author of the universe, his rational enthusiasm
confessed and adored an infinite and eternal being, without form or
place, without issue or similitude, present to our most secret thoughts,
existing by the necessity of his own nature, and deriving from himself
all moral and intellectual perfection. These sublime truths, thus
announced in the language of the prophet, <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> are firmly held by his
disciples, and defined with metaphysical precision by the interpreters
of the Koran. A philosophic theist might subscribe the popular creed
of the Mahometans; <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> a creed too sublime, perhaps, for our present
faculties. What object remains for the fancy, or even the understanding,
when we have abstracted from the unknown substance all ideas of time
and space, of motion and matter, of sensation and reflection? The
first principle of reason and revolution was confirmed by the voice of
Mahomet: his proselytes, from India to Morocco, are distinguished by the
name of Unitarians; and the danger of idolatry has been prevented by
the interdiction of images. The doctrine of eternal decrees and
absolute predestination is strictly embraced by the Mahometans; and they
struggle, with the common difficulties, how to reconcile the prescience
of God with the freedom and responsibility of man; how to explain
the permission of evil under the reign of infinite power and infinite
goodness.

The God of nature has written his existence on all his works, and his
law in the heart of man. To restore the knowledge of the one, and
the practice of the other, has been the real or pretended aim of
the prophets of every age: the liberality of Mahomet allowed to his
predecessors the same credit which he claimed for himself; and the chain
of inspiration was prolonged from the fall of Adam to the promulgation
of the Koran. <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> During that period, some rays of prophetic light
had been imparted to one hundred and twenty-four thousand of the elect,
discriminated by their respective measure of virtue and grace; three
hundred and thirteen apostles were sent with a special commission
to recall their country from idolatry and vice; one hundred and four
volumes have been dictated by the Holy Spirit; and six legislators of
transcendent brightness have announced to mankind the six successive
revelations of various rites, but of one immutable religion. The
authority and station of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Christ, and
Mahomet, rise in just gradation above each other; but whosoever hates
or rejects any one of the prophets is numbered with the infidels. The
writings of the patriarchs were extant only in the apocryphal copies of
the Greeks and Syrians: <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> the conduct of Adam had not entitled him
to the gratitude or respect of his children; the seven precepts of Noah
were observed by an inferior and imperfect class of the proselytes of
the synagogue; <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a> and the memory of Abraham was obscurely revered by
the Sabians in his native land of Chaldaea: of the myriads of prophets,
Moses and Christ alone lived and reigned; and the remnant of the
inspired writings was comprised in the books of the Old and the New
Testament. The miraculous story of Moses is consecrated and embellished

deride. For the author of Christianity, the Mahometans are taught by
the prophet to entertain a high and mysterious reverence. <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> "Verily,
Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, is the apostle of God, and his word,
which he conveyed unto Mary, and a Spirit proceeding from him; honorable
in this world, and in the world to come, and one of those who approach
near to the presence of God." <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> The wonders of the genuine and
apocryphal gospels <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> are profusely heaped on his head; and the
Latin church has not disdained to borrow from the Koran the immaculate
conception <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a> of his virgin mother. Yet Jesus was a mere mortal; and,
at the day of judgment, his testimony will serve to condemn both the
Jews, who reject him as a prophet, and the Christians, who adore him as
the Son of God. The malice of his enemies aspersed his reputation,
and conspired against his life; but their intention only was guilty;
a phantom or a criminal was substituted on the cross; and the innocent
saint was translated to the seventh heaven. <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> During six hundred
years the gospel was the way of truth and salvation; but the Christians
insensibly forgot both the laws and example of their founder; and
Mahomet was instructed by the Gnostics to accuse the church, as well as
the synagogue, of corrupting the integrity of the sacred text. <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a>
The piety of Moses and of Christ rejoiced in the assurance of a future
prophet, more illustrious than themselves: the evangelical promise
of the Paraclete, or Holy Ghost, was prefigured in the name, and
accomplished in the person, of Mahomet, <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a> the greatest and the last
of the apostles of God.

<h2>
    Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
The communication of ideas requires a similitude of thought and
language: the discourse of a philosopher would vibrate without effect
on the ear of a peasant; yet how minute is the distance of their
understandings, if it be compared with the contact of an infinite and a
finite mind, with the word of God expressed by the tongue or the pen of
a mortal! The inspiration of the Hebrew prophets, of the apostles and
evangelists of Christ, might not be incompatible with the exercise of
their reason and memory; and the diversity of their genius is strongly
marked in the style and composition of the books of the Old and New
Testament. But Mahomet was content with a character, more humble, yet
more sublime, of a simple editor; the substance of the Koran, <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a>
according to himself or his disciples, is uncreated and eternal;
subsisting in the essence of the Deity, and inscribed with a pen of
light on the table of his everlasting decrees. A paper copy, in a volume
of silk and gems, was brought down to the lowest heaven by the angel
Gabriel, who, under the Jewish economy, had indeed been despatched
on the most important errands; and this trusty messenger successively
revealed the chapters and verses to the Arabian prophet. Instead of a
perpetual and perfect measure of the divine will, the fragments of the
Koran were produced at the discretion of Mahomet; each revelation
is suited to the emergencies of his policy or passion; and all
contradiction is removed by the saving maxim, that any text of Scripture
is abrogated or modified by any subsequent passage. The word of God, and
of the apostle, was diligently recorded by his disciples on palm-leaves
and the shoulder-bones of mutton; and the pages, without order or
connection, were cast into a domestic chest, in the custody of one of
his wives. Two years after the death of Mahomet, the sacred volume was
collected and published by his friend and successor Abubeker: the work
was revised by the caliph Othman, in the thirtieth year of the Hegira;
and the various editions of the Koran assert the same miraculous
privilege of a uniform and incorruptible text. In the spirit of
enthusiasm or vanity, the prophet rests the truth of his mission on the
merit of his book; audaciously challenges both men and angels to imitate
the beauties of a single page; and presumes to assert that God alone
could dictate this incomparable performance. <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> This argument is most
powerfully addressed to a devout Arabian, whose mind is attuned to faith
and rapture; whose ear is delighted by the music of sounds; and whose
ignorance is incapable of comparing the productions of human genius.
<a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> The harmony and copiousness of style will not reach, in a version,
the European infidel: he will peruse with impatience the endless
incoherent rhapsody of fable, and precept, and declamation, which seldom
excites a sentiment or an idea, which sometimes crawls in the dust, and
is sometimes lost in the clouds. The divine attributes exalt the fancy
of the Arabian missionary; but his loftiest strains must yield to the
sublime simplicity of the book of Job, composed in a remote age, in the
same country, and in the same language. <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> If the composition of the
Koran exceed the faculties of a man to what superior intelligence should
we ascribe the Iliad of Homer, or the Philippics of Demosthenes? In all
religions, the life of the founder supplies the silence of his written
revelation: the sayings of Mahomet were so many lessons of truth; his
actions so many examples of virtue; and the public and private memorials
were preserved by his wives and companions. At the end of two hundred
years, the Sonna, or oral law, was fixed and consecrated by the
labors of Al Bochari, who discriminated seven thousand two hundred and
seventy-five genuine traditions, from a mass of three hundred thousand
reports, of a more doubtful or spurious character. Each day the pious
author prayed in the temple of Mecca, and performed his ablutions with
the water of Zemzem: the pages were successively deposited on the pulpit
and the sepulchre of the apostle; and the work has been approved by the
four orthodox sects of the Sonnites. <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a>

a much earlier dialect; or the Chaldaic may have adopted the poetical
archaisms of a dialect, differing from, but not less ancient than, the

<p>
The mission of the ancient prophets, of Moses and of Jesus had been
confirmed by many splendid prodigies; and Mahomet was repeatedly urged,
by the inhabitants of Mecca and Medina, to produce a similar evidence of
his divine legation; to call down from heaven the angel or the volume
of his revelation, to create a garden in the desert, or to kindle a
conflagration in the unbelieving city. As often as he is pressed by
the demands of the Koreish, he involves himself in the obscure boast of
vision and prophecy, appeals to the internal proofs of his doctrine, and
shields himself behind the providence of God, who refuses those signs
and wonders that would depreciate the merit of faith, and aggravate
the guilt of infidelity But the modest or angry tone of his apologies
betrays his weakness and vexation; and these passages of scandal
established, beyond suspicion, the integrity of the Koran. <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> The
votaries of Mahomet are more assured than himself of his miraculous
gifts; and their confidence and credulity increase as they are farther
removed from the time and place of his spiritual exploits. They believe
or affirm that trees went forth to meet him; that he was saluted by
stones; that water gushed from his fingers; that he fed the hungry,
cured the sick, and raised the dead; that a beam groaned to him; that a
camel complained to him; that a shoulder of mutton informed him of its
being poisoned; and that both animate and inanimate nature were equally
subject to the apostle of God. <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> His dream of a nocturnal journey is
seriously described as a real and corporeal transaction. A mysterious
animal, the Borak, conveyed him from the temple of Mecca to that of
Jerusalem: with his companion Gabriel he successively ascended the seven
heavens, and received and repaid the salutations of the patriarchs,
the prophets, and the angels, in their respective mansions. Beyond the
seventh heaven, Mahomet alone was permitted to proceed; he passed the
veil of unity, approached within two bow-shots of the throne, and felt a
cold that pierced him to the heart, when his shoulder was touched by
the hand of God. After this familiar, though important conversation, he
again descended to Jerusalem, remounted the Borak, returned to Mecca,
and performed in the tenth part of a night the journey of many thousand
years. <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> According to another legend, the apostle confounded in a
national assembly the malicious challenge of the Koreish. His resistless
word split asunder the orb of the moon: the obedient planet stooped from
her station in the sky, accomplished the seven revolutions round the
Caaba, saluted Mahomet in the Arabian tongue, and, suddenly contracting
her dimensions, entered at the collar, and issued forth through the
sleeve, of his shirt. <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> The vulgar are amused with these marvellous
tales; but the gravest of the Mussulman doctors imitate the modesty of
their master, and indulge a latitude of faith or interpretation. <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a>
They might speciously allege, that in preaching the religion it was
needless to violate the harmony of nature; that a creed unclouded with
mystery may be excused from miracles; and that the sword of Mahomet was
not less potent than the rod of Moses.

<p>
The polytheist is oppressed and distracted by the variety of
superstition: a thousand rites of Egyptian origin were interwoven
with the essence of the Mosaic law; and the spirit of the gospel had
evaporated in the pageantry of the church. The prophet of Mecca was
tempted by prejudice, or policy, or patriotism, to sanctify the rites
of the Arabians, and the custom of visiting the holy stone of the
Caaba. But the precepts of Mahomet himself inculcates a more simple and
rational piety: prayer, fasting, and alms, are the religious duties of a
Mussulman; and he is encouraged to hope, that prayer will carry him half
way to God, fasting will bring him to the door of his palace, and alms
will gain him admittance. <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> I. According to the tradition of the
nocturnal journey, the apostle, in his personal conference with the
Deity, was commanded to impose on his disciples the daily obligation of
fifty prayers. By the advice of Moses, he applied for an alleviation
of this intolerable burden; the number was gradually reduced to five;
without any dispensation of business or pleasure, or time or place:
the devotion of the faithful is repeated at daybreak, at noon, in the
afternoon, in the evening, and at the first watch of the night; and in
the present decay of religious fervor, our travellers are edified by the
profound humility and attention of the Turks and Persians. Cleanliness
is the key of prayer: the frequent lustration of the hands, the face,
and the body, which was practised of old by the Arabs, is solemnly
enjoined by the Koran; and a permission is formally granted to
supply with sand the scarcity of water. The words and attitudes of
supplication, as it is performed either sitting, or standing, or
prostrate on the ground, are prescribed by custom or authority; but the
prayer is poured forth in short and fervent ejaculations; the measure of
zeal is not exhausted by a tedious liturgy; and each Mussulman for
his own person is invested with the character of a priest. Among the
theists, who reject the use of images, it has been found necessary
to restrain the wanderings of the fancy, by directing the eye and the
thought towards a kebla, or visible point of the horizon. The prophet
was at first inclined to gratify the Jews by the choice of Jerusalem;
but he soon returned to a more natural partiality; and five times every
day the eyes of the nations at Astracan, at Fez, at Delhi, are devoutly
turned to the holy temple of Mecca. Yet every spot for the service of
God is equally pure: the Mahometans indifferently pray in their chamber
or in the street. As a distinction from the Jews and Christians, the
Friday in each week is set apart for the useful institution of public
worship: the people is assembled in the mosch; and the imam, some
respectable elder, ascends the pulpit, to begin the prayer and pronounce
the sermon. But the Mahometan religion is destitute of priesthood or
sacrifice; and the independent spirit of fanaticism looks down with
contempt on the ministers and the slaves of superstition. <a href="#note-1011" name="noteref-1011"><small>1011</small></a>
</p>
<p>
II. The voluntary <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> penance of the ascetics, the torment and glory
of their lives, was odious to a prophet who censured in his companions
a rash vow of abstaining from flesh, and women, and sleep; and firmly
declared, that he would suffer no monks in his religion. <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> Yet
he instituted, in each year, a fast of thirty days; and strenuously
recommended the observance as a discipline which purifies the soul and
subdues the body, as a salutary exercise of obedience to the will of
God and his apostle. During the month of Ramadan, from the rising to the
setting of the sun, the Mussulman abstains from eating, and drinking,
and women, and baths, and perfumes; from all nourishment that can
restore his strength, from all pleasure that can gratify his senses. In
the revolution of the lunar year, the Ramadan coincides, by turns, with
the winter cold and the summer heat; and the patient martyr, without
assuaging his thirst with a drop of water, must expect the close of
a tedious and sultry day. The interdiction of wine, peculiar to some
orders of priests or hermits, is converted by Mahomet alone into a
positive and general law; <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> and a considerable portion of the globe
has abjured, at his command, the use of that salutary, though dangerous,
liquor. These painful restraints are, doubtless, infringed by the
libertine, and eluded by the hypocrite; but the legislator, by whom they
are enacted, cannot surely be accused of alluring his proselytes by
the indulgence of their sensual appetites. III. The charity of the
Mahometans descends to the animal creation; and the Koran repeatedly
inculcates, not as a merit, but as a strict and indispensable duty, the
relief of the indigent and unfortunate. Mahomet, perhaps, is the only
lawgiver who has defined the precise measure of charity: the standard
may vary with the degree and nature of property, as it consists either
in money, in corn or cattle, in fruits or merchandise; but the Mussulman
does not accomplish the law, unless he bestows a tenth of his revenue;
and if his conscience accuses him of fraud or extortion, the tenth,
under the idea of restitution, is enlarged to a fifth. <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> Benevolence
is the foundation of justice, since we are forbid to injure those whom
we are bound to assist. A prophet may reveal the secrets of heaven and
of futurity; but in his moral precepts he can only repeat the lessons of
our own hearts.

camels (probably according to the old Arabian rites) at Mecca; and

author quotes the questionable authority of Benjamin of Tudela, for the
sacrifice of a camel by the caliph at Bosra; but sacrifice undoubtedly
forms no part of the ordinary Mahometan ritual; nor will the sanctity of

The two articles of belief, and the four practical duties, of Islam, are
guarded by rewards and punishments; and the faith of the Mussulman
is devoutly fixed on the event of the judgment and the last day.
The prophet has not presumed to determine the moment of that awful
catastrophe, though he darkly announces the signs, both in heaven and
earth, which will precede the universal dissolution, when life shall
be destroyed, and the order of creation shall be confounded in the
primitive chaos. At the blast of the trumpet, new worlds will start into
being: angels, genii, and men will arise from the dead, and the human
soul will again be united to the body. The doctrine of the resurrection
was first entertained by the Egyptians; <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> and their mummies were
embalmed, their pyramids were constructed, to preserve the ancient
mansion of the soul, during a period of three thousand years. But the
attempt is partial and unavailing; and it is with a more philosophic
spirit that Mahomet relies on the omnipotence of the Creator, whose word
can reanimate the breathless clay, and collect the innumerable atoms,
that no longer retain their form or substance. <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a> The intermediate
state of the soul it is hard to decide; and those who most firmly

<p>
The reunion of the soul and body will be followed by the final judgment
of mankind; and in his copy of the Magian picture, the prophet has too
faithfully represented the forms of proceeding, and even the slow
and successive operations, of an earthly tribunal. By his intolerant
adversaries he is upbraided for extending, even to themselves, the hope
of salvation, for asserting the blackest heresy, that every man who
believes in God, and accomplishes good works, may expect in the last day
a favorable sentence. Such rational indifference is ill adapted to the
character of a fanatic; nor is it probable that a messenger from heaven
should depreciate the value and necessity of his own revelation. In the
idiom of the Koran, <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> the belief of God is inseparable from that
of Mahomet: the good works are those which he has enjoined, and the two
qualifications imply the profession of Islam, to which all nations and
all sects are equally invited.
</p>
<p>
Their spiritual blindness, though excused by ignorance and crowned with
virtue, will be scourged with everlasting torments; and the tears which
Mahomet shed over the tomb of his mother for whom he was forbidden to
pray, display a striking contrast of humanity and enthusiasm. <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a>
The doom of the infidels is common: the measure of their guilt and
punishment is determined by the degree of evidence which they have
rejected, by the magnitude of the errors which they have entertained:
the eternal mansions of the Christians, the Jews, the Sabians, the
Magians, and idolaters, are sunk below each other in the abyss; and the
lowest hell is reserved for the faithless hypocrites who have assumed
the mask of religion. After the greater part of mankind has been
condemned for their opinions, the true believers only will be judged by
their actions. The good and evil of each Mussulman will be accurately
weighed in a real or allegorical balance; and a singular mode of
compensation will be allowed for the payment of injuries: the aggressor
will refund an equivalent of his own good actions, for the benefit of
the person whom he has wronged; and if he should be destitute of any
moral property, the weight of his sins will be loaded with an adequate
share of the demerits of the sufferer. According as the shares of guilt
or virtue shall preponderate, the sentence will be pronounced, and all,
without distinction, will pass over the sharp and perilous bridge of
the abyss; but the innocent, treading in the footsteps of Mahomet, will
gloriously enter the gates of paradise, while the guilty will fall into
the first and mildest of the seven hells. The term of expiation will
vary from nine hundred to seven thousand years; but the prophet has
judiciously promised, that all his disciples, whatever may be their
sins, shall be saved, by their own faith and his intercession from
eternal damnation. It is not surprising that superstition should act
most powerfully on the fears of her votaries, since the human fancy can
paint with more energy the misery than the bliss of a future life. With
the two simple elements of darkness and fire, we create a sensation
of pain, which may be aggravated to an infinite degree by the idea of
endless duration. But the same idea operates with an opposite effect on
the continuity of pleasure; and too much of our present enjoyments is
obtained from the relief, or the comparison, of evil. It is natural
enough that an Arabian prophet should dwell with rapture on the groves,
the fountains, and the rivers of paradise; but instead of inspiring
the blessed inhabitants with a liberal taste for harmony and science,
conversation and friendship, he idly celebrates the pearls and diamonds,
the robes of silk, palaces of marble, dishes of gold, rich wines,
artificial dainties, numerous attendants, and the whole train of sensual
and costly luxury, which becomes insipid to the owner, even in the short
period of this mortal life. Seventy-two Houris, or black-eyed girls,
of resplendent beauty, blooming youth, virgin purity, and exquisite
sensibility, will be created for the use of the meanest believer;
a moment of pleasure will be prolonged to a thousand years; and his
faculties will be increased a hundred fold, to render him worthy of his
felicity. Notwithstanding a vulgar prejudice, the gates of heaven will
be open to both sexes; but Mahomet has not specified the male companions
of the female elect, lest he should either alarm the jealousy of their
former husbands, or disturb their felicity, by the suspicion of an
everlasting marriage. This image of a carnal paradise has provoked the
indignation, perhaps the envy, of the monks: they declaim against the
impure religion of Mahomet; and his modest apologists are driven to
the poor excuse of figures and allegories. But the sounder and more
consistent party adhere without shame, to the literal interpretation of
the Koran: useless would be the resurrection of the body, unless it were
restored to the possession and exercise of its worthiest faculties; and
the union of sensual and intellectual enjoyment is requisite to complete
the happiness of the double animal, the perfect man. Yet the joys of the
Mahometan paradise will not be confined to the indulgence of luxury
and appetite; and the prophet has expressly declared that all meaner
happiness will be forgotten and despised by the saints and martyrs, who
shall be admitted to the beatitude of the divine vision. <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a>

<p>
The first and most arduous conquests of Mahomet <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a> were those of his
wife, his servant, his pupil, and his friend; <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> since he presented
himself as a prophet to those who were most conversant with his
infirmities as a man. Yet Cadijah believed the words, and cherished the
glory, of her husband; the obsequious and affectionate Zeid was tempted
by the prospect of freedom; the illustrious Ali, the son of Abu Taleb,
embraced the sentiments of his cousin with the spirit of a youthful
hero; and the wealth, the moderation, the veracity of Abubeker confirmed
the religion of the prophet whom he was destined to succeed. By
his persuasion, ten of the most respectable citizens of Mecca were
introduced to the private lessons of Islam; they yielded to the voice
of reason and enthusiasm; they repeated the fundamental creed, "There is
but one God, and Mahomet is the apostle of God;" and their faith, even
in this life, was rewarded with riches and honors, with the command
of armies and the government of kingdoms. Three years were silently
employed in the conversion of fourteen proselytes, the first-fruits of
his mission; but in the fourth year he assumed the prophetic office, and
resolving to impart to his family the light of divine truth, he
prepared a banquet, a lamb, as it is said, and a bowl of milk, for
the entertainment of forty guests of the race of Hashem. "Friends and
kinsmen," said Mahomet to the assembly, "I offer you, and I alone can
offer, the most precious of gifts, the treasures of this world and of
the world to come. God has commanded me to call you to his service. Who
among you will support my burden? Who among you will be my companion
and my vizier?" <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> No answer was returned, till the silence of
astonishment, and doubt, and contempt, was at length broken by the
impatient courage of Ali, a youth in the fourteenth year of his age. "O
prophet, I am the man: whosoever rises against thee, I will dash out his
teeth, tear out his eyes, break his legs, rip up his belly. O prophet,
I will be thy vizier over them." Mahomet accepted his offer with
transport, and Abu Taled was ironically exhorted to respect the superior
dignity of his son. In a more serious tone, the father of Ali advised
his nephew to relinquish his impracticable design.
</p>
<p>
"Spare your remonstrances," replied the intrepid fanatic to his uncle
and benefactor; "if they should place the sun on my right hand, and
the moon on my left, they should not divert me from my course." He
persevered ten years in the exercise of his mission; and the religion
which has overspread the East and the West advanced with a slow and
painful progress within the walls of Mecca. Yet Mahomet enjoyed the
satisfaction of beholding the increase of his infant congregation of
Unitarians, who revered him as a prophet, and to whom he seasonably
dispensed the spiritual nourishment of the Koran. The number of
proselytes may be esteemed by the absence of eighty-three men and
eighteen women, who retired to Aethiopia in the seventh year of his
mission; and his party was fortified by the timely conversion of his
uncle Hamza, and of the fierce and inflexible Omar, who signalized
in the cause of Islam the same zeal, which he had exerted for its
destruction. Nor was the charity of Mahomet confined to the tribe of
Koreish, or the precincts of Mecca: on solemn festivals, in the days
of pilgrimage, he frequented the Caaba, accosted the strangers of every
tribe, and urged, both in private converse and public discourse, the
belief and worship of a sole Deity. Conscious of his reason and of his
weakness, he asserted the liberty of conscience, and disclaimed the use
of religious violence: <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> but he called the Arabs to repentance, and
conjured them to remember the ancient idolaters of Ad and Thamud, whom
the divine justice had swept away from the face of the earth. <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a>

1-248,) and Sale, (Preliminary Discourse, p. 33-56,) had accurately
studied the language and character of their author. Two professed Lives
of Mahomet have been composed by Dr. Prideaux (Life of Mahomet, seventh
edition, London, 1718, in octavo) and the count de Boulainvilliers, (Vie
de Mahomed, Londres, 1730, in octavo: ) but the adverse wish of finding
an impostor or a hero, has too often corrupted the learning of the
doctor and the ingenuity of the count. The article in D'Herbelot
(Bibliot. Orient. p. 598-603) is chiefly drawn from Novairi and
Mirkond; but the best and most authentic of our guides is M. Gagnier, a
Frenchman by birth, and professor at Oxford of the Oriental tongues.
In two elaborate works, (Ismael Abulfeda de Vita et Rebus gestis
Mohammedis, &amp;c. Latine vertit, Praefatione et Notis illustravit Johannes
Gagnier, Oxon. 1723, in folio. La Vie de Mahomet traduite et compilee

Auteurs Arabes; Amsterdam, 1748, 3 vols. in 12mo.,) he has interpreted,
illustrated, and supplied the Arabic text of Abulfeda and Al Jannabi;
the first, an enlightened prince who reigned at Hamah, in Syria, A.D.
1310-1332, (see Gagnier Praefat. ad Abulfed.;) the second, a credulous
doctor, who visited Mecca A.D. 1556. (D'Herbelot, p. 397. Gagnier, tom.
iii. p. 209, 210.) These are my general vouchers, and the inquisitive
reader may follow the order of time, and the division of chapters. Yet
I must observe that both Abulfeda and Al Jannabi are modern historians,
and that they cannot appeal to any writers of the first century of the
Hegira. * Note: A new Life, by Dr. Weil, (Stuttgart. 1843,) has added
some few traditions unknown in Europe. Of Dr. Weil's Arabic scholarship,
which professes to correct many errors in Gagnier, in Maracci, and in
M. von Hammer, I am no judge. But it is remarkable that he does not
seem acquainted with the passage of Tabari, translated by Colonel Vans
Kennedy, in the Bombay Transactions, (vol. iii.,) the earliest and
most important addition made to the traditionary Life of Mahomet. I am
inclined to think Colonel Vans Kennedy's appreciation of the prophet's
character, which may be overlooked in a criticism on Voltaire's Mahomet,
the most just which I have ever read. The work of Dr. Weil appears to me
most valuable in its dissection and chronological view of the Koran.&mdash;M.

<h2>
    Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>
<p>
The people of Mecca were hardened in their unbelief by superstition and
envy. The elders of the city, the uncles of the prophet, affected to
despise the presumption of an orphan, the reformer of his country: the
pious orations of Mahomet in the Caaba were answered by the clamors of
Abu Taleb. "Citizens and pilgrims, listen not to the tempter, hearken
not to his impious novelties. Stand fast in the worship of Al Lata and
Al Uzzah." Yet the son of Abdallah was ever dear to the aged chief: and
he protected the fame and person of his nephew against the assaults of
the Koreishites, who had long been jealous of the preeminence of
the family of Hashem. Their malice was colored with the pretence of
religion: in the age of Job, the crime of impiety was punished by
the Arabian magistrate; <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> and Mahomet was guilty of deserting and
denying the national deities. But so loose was the policy of Mecca,
that the leaders of the Koreish, instead of accusing a criminal,
were compelled to employ the measures of persuasion or violence. They
repeatedly addressed Abu Taleb in the style of reproach and menace.
"Thy nephew reviles our religion; he accuses our wise forefathers of
ignorance and folly; silence him quickly, lest he kindle tumult and
discord in the city. If he persevere, we shall draw our swords against
him and his adherents, and thou wilt be responsible for the blood of
thy fellow-citizens." The weight and moderation of Abu Taleb eluded
the violence of religious faction; the most helpless or timid of the
disciples retired to Aethiopia, and the prophet withdrew himself to
various places of strength in the town and country. As he was still
supported by his family, the rest of the tribe of Koreish engaged
themselves to renounce all intercourse with the children of Hashem,
neither to buy nor sell, neither to marry not to give in marriage, but
to pursue them with implacable enmity, till they should deliver the
person of Mahomet to the justice of the gods. The decree was suspended
in the Caaba before the eyes of the nation; the messengers of the
Koreish pursued the Mussulman exiles in the heart of Africa: they
besieged the prophet and his most faithful followers, intercepted
their water, and inflamed their mutual animosity by the retaliation
of injuries and insults. A doubtful truce restored the appearances of
concord till the death of Abu Taleb abandoned Mahomet to the power of
his enemies, at the moment when he was deprived of his domestic comforts
by the loss of his faithful and generous Cadijah. Abu Sophian, the chief
of the branch of Ommiyah, succeeded to the principality of the republic
of Mecca. A zealous votary of the idols, a mortal foe of the line of
Hashem, he convened an assembly of the Koreishites and their allies,
to decide the fate of the apostle. His imprisonment might provoke the
despair of his enthusiasm; and the exile of an eloquent and popular
fanatic would diffuse the mischief through the provinces of Arabia. His
death was resolved; and they agreed that a sword from each tribe should
be buried in his heart, to divide the guilt of his blood, and baffle
the vengeance of the Hashemites. An angel or a spy revealed their
conspiracy; and flight was the only resource of Mahomet. <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> At the
dead of night, accompanied by his friend Abubeker, he silently escaped
from his house: the assassins watched at the door; but they were
deceived by the figure of Ali, who reposed on the bed, and was covered
with the green vestment of the apostle. The Koreish respected the piety
of the heroic youth; but some verses of Ali, which are still extant,
exhibit an interesting picture of his anxiety, his tenderness, and
his religious confidence. Three days Mahomet and his companion were
concealed in the cave of Thor, at the distance of a league from Mecca;
and in the close of each evening, they received from the son and
daughter of Abubeker a secret supply of intelligence and food. The
diligence of the Koreish explored every haunt in the neighborhood of the
city: they arrived at the entrance of the cavern; but the providential
deceit of a spider's web and a pigeon's nest is supposed to convince
them that the place was solitary and inviolate. "We are only two," said
the trembling Abubeker. "There is a third," replied the prophet; "it is
God himself." No sooner was the pursuit abated than the two fugitives
issued from the rock, and mounted their camels: on the road to Medina,
they were overtaken by the emissaries of the Koreish; they redeemed
themselves with prayers and promises from their hands. In this eventful
moment, the lance of an Arab might have changed the history of the
world. The flight of the prophet from Mecca to Medina has fixed
the memorable aera of the Hegira, <a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a> which, at the end of twelve
centuries, still discriminates the lunar years of the Mahometan nations.

The religion of the Koran might have perished in its cradle, had not
Medina embraced with faith and reverence the holy outcasts of Mecca.
Medina, or the city, known under the name of Yathreb, before it was
sanctified by the throne of the prophet, was divided between the tribes
of the Charegites and the Awsites, whose hereditary feud was rekindled
by the slightest provocations: two colonies of Jews, who boasted a
sacerdotal race, were their humble allies, and without converting
the Arabs, they introduced the taste of science and religion, which
distinguished Medina as the city of the Book. Some of her noblest
citizens, in a pilgrimage to the Canaba, were converted by the preaching
of Mahomet; on their return, they diffused the belief of God and his
prophet, and the new alliance was ratified by their deputies in two
secret and nocturnal interviews on a hill in the suburbs of Mecca. In
the first, ten Charegites and two Awsites united in faith and love,
protested, in the name of their wives, their children, and their absent
brethren, that they would forever profess the creed, and observe the
precepts, of the Koran. The second was a political association, the
first vital spark of the empire of the Saracens. <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> Seventy-three
men and two women of Medina held a solemn conference with Mahomet, his
kinsman, and his disciples; and pledged themselves to each other by a
mutual oath of fidelity. They promised, in the name of the city, that if
he should be banished, they would receive him as a confederate, obey him
as a leader, and defend him to the last extremity, like their wives and
children. "But if you are recalled by your country," they asked with
a flattering anxiety, "will you not abandon your new allies?" "All
things," replied Mahomet with a smile, "are now common between us your
blood is as my blood, your ruin as my ruin. We are bound to each other
by the ties of honor and interest. I am your friend, and the enemy of
your foes." "But if we are killed in your service, what," exclaimed
the deputies of Medina, "will be our reward?" "Paradise," replied the
prophet. "Stretch forth thy hand." He stretched it forth, and they
reiterated the oath of allegiance and fidelity. Their treaty was
ratified by the people, who unanimously embraced the profession of
Islam; they rejoiced in the exile of the apostle, but they trembled for
his safety, and impatiently expected his arrival. After a perilous and
rapid journey along the sea-coast, he halted at Koba, two miles from
the city, and made his public entry into Medina, sixteen days after his
flight from Mecca. Five hundred of the citizens advanced to meet him;
he was hailed with acclamations of loyalty and devotion; Mahomet was
mounted on a she-camel, an umbrella shaded his head, and a turban was
unfurled before him to supply the deficiency of a standard. His bravest
disciples, who had been scattered by the storm, assembled round
his person; and the equal, though various, merit of the Moslems was
distinguished by the names of Mohagerians and Ansars, the fugitives
of Mecca, and the auxiliaries of Medina. To eradicate the seeds of
jealousy, Mahomet judiciously coupled his principal followers with the
rights and obligations of brethren; and when Ali found himself without a
peer, the prophet tenderly declared, that he would be the companion and
brother of the noble youth. The expedient was crowned with success; the
holy fraternity was respected in peace and war, and the two parties vied
with each other in a generous emulation of courage and fidelity. Once
only the concord was slightly ruffled by an accidental quarrel: a
patriot of Medina arraigned the insolence of the strangers, but the
hint of their expulsion was heard with abhorrence; and his own son most
eagerly offered to lay at the apostle's feet the head of his father.

From his establishment at Medina, Mahomet assumed the exercise of the
regal and sacerdotal office; and it was impious to appeal from a judge
whose decrees were inspired by the divine wisdom. A small portion of
ground, the patrimony of two orphans, was acquired by gift or purchase;
<a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a> on that chosen spot he built a house and a mosch, more venerable
in their rude simplicity than the palaces and temples of the Assyrian
caliphs. His seal of gold, or silver, was inscribed with the apostolic
title; when he prayed and preached in the weekly assembly, he leaned
against the trunk of a palm-tree; and it was long before he indulged
himself in the use of a chair or pulpit of rough timber. <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> After a
reign of six years, fifteen hundred Moslems, in arms and in the field,
renewed their oath of allegiance; and their chief repeated the
assurance of protection till the death of the last member, or the final
dissolution of the party. It was in the same camp that the deputy of
Mecca was astonished by the attention of the faithful to the words and
looks of the prophet, by the eagerness with which they collected his
spittle, a hair that dropped on the ground, the refuse water of his
lustrations, as if they participated in some degree of the prophetic
virtue. "I have seen," said he, "the Chosroes of Persia and the Caesar
of Rome, but never did I behold a king among his subjects like Mahomet
among his companions." The devout fervor of enthusiasm acts with more
energy and truth than the cold and formal servility of courts.

In the state of nature, every man has a right to defend, by force of
arms, his person and his possessions; to repel, or even to prevent, the
violence of his enemies, and to extend his hostilities to a reasonable
measure of satisfaction and retaliation. In the free society of the
Arabs, the duties of subject and citizen imposed a feeble restraint; and
Mahomet, in the exercise of a peaceful and benevolent mission, had been
despoiled and banished by the injustice of his countrymen. The choice of
an independent people had exalted the fugitive of Mecca to the rank of
a sovereign; and he was invested with the just prerogative of forming
alliances, and of waging offensive or defensive war. The imperfection
of human rights was supplied and armed by the plenitude of divine power:
the prophet of Medina assumed, in his new revelations, a fiercer and
more sanguinary tone, which proves that his former moderation was the
effect of weakness: <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a> the means of persuasion had been tried, the
season of forbearance was elapsed, and he was now commanded to propagate
his religion by the sword, to destroy the monuments of idolatry,
and, without regarding the sanctity of days or months, to pursue
the unbelieving nations of the earth. The same bloody precepts, so
repeatedly inculcated in the Koran, are ascribed by the author to the
Pentateuch and the Gospel. But the mild tenor of the evangelic style may
explain an ambiguous text, that Jesus did not bring peace on the earth,
but a sword: his patient and humble virtues should not be confounded
with the intolerant zeal of princes and bishops, who have disgraced
the name of his disciples. In the prosecution of religious war, Mahomet
might appeal with more propriety to the example of Moses, of the Judges,
and the kings of Israel. The military laws of the Hebrews are still
more rigid than those of the Arabian legislator. <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a> The Lord of hosts
marched in person before the Jews: if a city resisted their summons, the
males, without distinction, were put to the sword: the seven nations
of Canaan were devoted to destruction; and neither repentance nor
conversion, could shield them from the inevitable doom, that no creature
within their precincts should be left alive. <a href="#note-1241" name="noteref-1241"><small>1241</small></a> The fair option of
friendship, or submission, or battle, was proposed to the enemies of
Mahomet. If they professed the creed of Islam, they were admitted to
all the temporal and spiritual benefits of his primitive disciples,
and marched under the same banner to extend the religion which they had
embraced. The clemency of the prophet was decided by his interest: yet
he seldom trampled on a prostrate enemy; and he seems to promise,
that on the payment of a tribute, the least guilty of his unbelieving
subjects might be indulged in their worship, or at least in their
imperfect faith. In the first months of his reign he practised the
lessons of holy warfare, and displayed his white banner before the
gates of Medina: the martial apostle fought in person at nine battles or
sieges; <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a> and fifty enterprises of war were achieved in ten years by
himself or his lieutenants. The Arab continued to unite the professions
of a merchant and a robber; and his petty excursions for the defence or
the attack of a caravan insensibly prepared his troops for the conquest
of Arabia. The distribution of the spoil was regulated by a divine law:
<a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> the whole was faithfully collected in one common mass: a fifth
of the gold and silver, the prisoners and cattle, the movables and
immovables, was reserved by the prophet for pious and charitable uses;
the remainder was shared in adequate portions by the soldiers who had
obtained the victory or guarded the camp: the rewards of the slain
devolved to their widows and orphans; and the increase of cavalry was
encouraged by the allotment of a double share to the horse and to the
man. From all sides the roving Arabs were allured to the standard of
religion and plunder: the apostle sanctified the license of embracing
the female captives as their wives or concubines, and the enjoyment of
wealth and beauty was a feeble type of the joys of paradise prepared for
the valiant martyrs of the faith. "The sword," says Mahomet, "is the key
of heaven and of hell; a drop of blood shed in the cause of God, a night
spent in arms, is of more avail than two months of fasting or prayer:
whosoever falls in battle, his sins are forgiven: at the day of judgment
his wounds shall be resplendent as vermilion, and odoriferous as musk;
and the loss of his limbs shall be supplied by the wings of angels and
cherubim." The intrepid souls of the Arabs were fired with enthusiasm:
the picture of the invisible world was strongly painted on their
imagination; and the death which they had always despised became an
object of hope and desire. The Koran inculcates, in the most absolute
sense, the tenets of fate and predestination, which would extinguish
both industry and virtue, if the actions of man were governed by his
speculative belief. Yet their influence in every age has exalted the
courage of the Saracens and Turks. The first companions of Mahomet
advanced to battle with a fearless confidence: there is no danger where
there is no chance: they were ordained to perish in their beds; or they
were safe and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy. <a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a>

Perhaps the Koreish would have been content with the dight of Mahomet,
had they not been provoked and alarmed by the vengeance of an enemy, who
could intercept their Syrian trade as it passed and repassed through
the territory of Medina. Abu Sophian himself, with only thirty or forty
followers, conducted a wealthy caravan of a thousand camels; the fortune
or dexterity of his march escaped the vigilance of Mahomet; but the
chief of the Koreish was informed that the holy robbers were placed in
ambush to await his return. He despatched a messenger to his brethren of
Mecca, and they were roused, by the fear of losing their merchandise and
their provisions, unless they hastened to his relief with the military
force of the city. The sacred band of Mahomet was formed of three
hundred and thirteen Moslems, of whom seventy-seven were fugitives, and
the rest auxiliaries; they mounted by turns a train of seventy camels,
(the camels of Yathreb were formidable in war;) but such was the poverty
of his first disciples, that only two could appear on horseback in
the field. <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> In the fertile and famous vale of Beder, <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a> three
stations from Medina, he was informed by his scouts of the caravan that
approached on one side; of the Koreish, one hundred horse, eight hundred
and fifty foot, who advanced on the other. After a short debate, he
sacrificed the prospect of wealth to the pursuit of glory and revenge,
and a slight intrenchment was formed, to cover his troops, and a stream
of fresh water, that glided through the valley. "O God," he exclaimed,
as the numbers of the Koreish descended from the hills, "O God, if these
are destroyed, by whom wilt thou be worshipped on the earth?&mdash;Courage,
my children; close your ranks; discharge your arrows, and the day is
your own." At these words he placed himself, with Abubeker, on a throne
or pulpit, <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> and instantly demanded the succor of Gabriel and
three thousand angels. His eye was fixed on the field of battle: the
Mussulmans fainted and were pressed: in that decisive moment the prophet
started from his throne, mounted his horse, and cast a handful of sand
into the air: "Let their faces be covered with confusion." Both armies
heard the thunder of his voice: their fancy beheld the angelic warriors:
<a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a> the Koreish trembled and fled: seventy of the bravest were slain;
and seventy captives adorned the first victory of the faithful. The
dead bodies of the Koreish were despoiled and insulted: two of the most
obnoxious prisoners were punished with death; and the ransom of the
others, four thousand drams of silver, compensated in some degree the
escape of the caravan. But it was in vain that the camels of Abu Sophian
explored a new road through the desert and along the Euphrates: they
were overtaken by the diligence of the Mussulmans; and wealthy must
have been the prize, if twenty thousand drams could be set apart for
the fifth of the apostle. The resentment of the public and private loss
stimulated Abu Sophian to collect a body of three thousand men, seven
hundred of whom were armed with cuirasses, and two hundred were mounted
on horseback; three thousand camels attended his march; and his wife
Henda, with fifteen matrons of Mecca, incessantly sounded their timbrels
to animate the troops, and to magnify the greatness of Hobal, the most
popular deity of the Caaba. The standard of God and Mahomet was upheld
by nine hundred and fifty believers: the disproportion of numbers was
not more alarming than in the field of Beder; and their presumption of
victory prevailed against the divine and human sense of the apostle.
The second battle was fought on Mount Ohud, six miles to the north of
Medina; <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a> the Koreish advanced in the form of a crescent; and the
right wing of cavalry was led by Caled, the fiercest and most successful
of the Arabian warriors. The troops of Mahomet were skilfully posted on
the declivity of the hill; and their rear was guarded by a detachment of
fifty archers. The weight of their charge impelled and broke the centre
of the idolaters: but in the pursuit they lost the advantage of their
ground: the archers deserted their station: the Mussulmans were tempted
by the spoil, disobeyed their general, and disordered their ranks. The
intrepid Caled, wheeling his cavalry on their flank and rear, exclaimed,
with a loud voice, that Mahomet was slain. He was indeed wounded in the
face with a javelin: two of his teeth were shattered with a stone; yet,
in the midst of tumult and dismay, he reproached the infidels with the
murder of a prophet; and blessed the friendly hand that stanched his
blood, and conveyed him to a place of safety Seventy martyrs died for
the sins of the people; they fell, said the apostle, in pairs, each
brother embracing his lifeless companion; <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> their bodies were
mangled by the inhuman females of Mecca; and the wife of Abu Sophian
tasted the entrails of Hamza, the uncle of Mahomet. They might applaud
their superstition, and satiate their fury; but the Mussulmans soon
rallied in the field, and the Koreish wanted strength or courage to
undertake the siege of Medina. It was attacked the ensuing year by an
army of ten thousand enemies; and this third expedition is variously
named from the nations, which marched under the banner of Abu Sophian,
from the ditch which was drawn before the city, and a camp of three
thousand Mussulmans. The prudence of Mahomet declined a general
engagement: the valor of Ali was signalized in single combat; and
the war was protracted twenty days, till the final separation of the
confederates. A tempest of wind, rain, and hail, overturned their tents:
their private quarrels were fomented by an insidious adversary; and
the Koreish, deserted by their allies, no longer hoped to subvert the
throne, or to check the conquests, of their invincible exile. <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a>

    Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.&mdash;Part VI.
</h2>
<p>
The choice of Jerusalem for the first kebla of prayer discovers the
early propensity of Mahomet in favor of the Jews; and happy would it
have been for their temporal interest, had they recognized, in the
Arabian prophet, the hope of Israel and the promised Messiah. Their
obstinacy converted his friendship into implacable hatred, with which he
pursued that unfortunate people to the last moment of his life; and in
the double character of an apostle and a conqueror, his persecution was
extended to both worlds. <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a> The Kainoka dwelt at Medina under the
protection of the city; he seized the occasion of an accidental tumult,
and summoned them to embrace his religion, or contend with him in
battle. "Alas!" replied the trembling Jews, "we are ignorant of the use
of arms, but we persevere in the faith and worship of our fathers; why
wilt thou reduce us to the necessity of a just defence?" The unequal
conflict was terminated in fifteen days; and it was with extreme
reluctance that Mahomet yielded to the importunity of his allies, and
consented to spare the lives of the captives. But their riches were
confiscated, their arms became more effectual in the hands of the
Mussulmans; and a wretched colony of seven hundred exiles was driven,
with their wives and children, to implore a refuge on the confines
of Syria. The Nadhirites were more guilty, since they conspired, in
a friendly interview, to assassinate the prophet. He besieged their
castle, three miles from Medina; but their resolute defence obtained an
honorable capitulation; and the garrison, sounding their trumpets and
beating their drums, was permitted to depart with the honors of war. The
Jews had excited and joined the war of the Koreish: no sooner had the
nations retired from the ditch, than Mahomet, without laying aside his
armor, marched on the same day to extirpate the hostile race of the
children of Koraidha. After a resistance of twenty-five days, they
surrendered at discretion. They trusted to the intercession of their old
allies of Medina; they could not be ignorant that fanaticism obliterates
the feelings of humanity. A venerable elder, to whose judgment they
appealed, pronounced the sentence of their death; seven hundred Jews
were dragged in chains to the market-place of the city; they descended
alive into the grave prepared for their execution and burial; and the
apostle beheld with an inflexible eye the slaughter of his helpless
enemies. Their sheep and camels were inherited by the Mussulmans: three
hundred cuirasses, five hundred piles, a thousand lances, composed the
most useful portion of the spoil. Six days' journey to the north-east
of Medina, the ancient and wealthy town of Chaibar was the seat of the
Jewish power in Arabia: the territory, a fertile spot in the desert,
was covered with plantations and cattle, and protected by eight castles,
some of which were esteemed of impregnable strength. The forces of
Mahomet consisted of two hundred horse and fourteen hundred foot: in
the succession of eight regular and painful sieges they were exposed to
danger, and fatigue, and hunger; and the most undaunted chiefs despaired
of the event. The apostle revived their faith and courage by the example
of Ali, on whom he bestowed the surname of the Lion of God: perhaps we
may believe that a Hebrew champion of gigantic stature was cloven to the
chest by his irresistible cimeter; but we cannot praise the modesty of
romance, which represents him as tearing from its hinges the gate of
a fortress and wielding the ponderous buckler in his left hand. <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a>
After the reduction of the castles, the town of Chaibar submitted to the
yoke. The chief of the tribe was tortured, in the presence of Mahomet,
to force a confession of his hidden treasure: the industry of the
shepherds and husbandmen was rewarded with a precarious toleration: they
were permitted, so long as it should please the conqueror, to improve
their patrimony, in equal shares, for his emolument and their own. Under
the reign of Omar, the Jews of Chaibar were transported to Syria; and
the caliph alleged the injunction of his dying master; that one and the
true religion should be professed in his native land of Arabia. <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a>

<p>
Five times each day the eyes of Mahomet were turned towards Mecca, <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a>
and he was urged by the most sacred and powerful motives to revisit, as
a conqueror, the city and the temple from whence he had been driven as
an exile. The Caaba was present to his waking and sleeping fancy: an
idle dream was translated into vision and prophecy; he unfurled the holy
banner; and a rash promise of success too hastily dropped from the lips
of the apostle. His march from Medina to Mecca displayed the peaceful
and solemn pomp of a pilgrimage: seventy camels, chosen and bedecked for
sacrifice, preceded the van; the sacred territory was respected; and
the captives were dismissed without ransom to proclaim his clemency and
devotion. But no sooner did Mahomet descend into the plain, within
a day's journey of the city, than he exclaimed, "They have clothed
themselves with the skins of tigers:" the numbers and resolution of the
Koreish opposed his progress; and the roving Arabs of the desert might
desert or betray a leader whom they had followed for the hopes of spoil.
The intrepid fanatic sunk into a cool and cautious politician: he waived
in the treaty his title of apostle of God; concluded with the Koreish
and their allies a truce of ten years; engaged to restore the fugitives
of Mecca who should embrace his religion; and stipulated only, for the
ensuing year, the humble privilege of entering the city as a friend,
and of remaining three days to accomplish the rites of the pilgrimage.
A cloud of shame and sorrow hung on the retreat of the Mussulmans, and
their disappointment might justly accuse the failure of a prophet who
had so often appealed to the evidence of success. The faith and hope of
the pilgrims were rekindled by the prospect of Mecca: their swords
were sheathed; <a href="#note-1381" name="noteref-1381"><small>1381</small></a> seven times in the footsteps of the apostle
they encompassed the Caaba: the Koreish had retired to the hills, and
Mahomet, after the customary sacrifice, evacuated the city on the fourth
day. The people was edified by his devotion; the hostile chiefs were
awed, or divided, or seduced; and both Kaled and Amrou, the future
conquerors of Syria and Egypt, most seasonably deserted the sinking
cause of idolatry. The power of Mahomet was increased by the submission
of the Arabian tribes; ten thousand soldiers were assembled for the
conquest of Mecca; and the idolaters, the weaker party, were easily
convicted of violating the truce. Enthusiasm and discipline impelled
the march, and preserved the secret till the blaze of ten thousand fires
proclaimed to the astonished Koreish the design, the approach, and the
irresistible force of the enemy. The haughty Abu Sophian presented the
keys of the city, admired the variety of arms and ensigns that passed
before him in review; observed that the son of Abdallah had acquired a
mighty kingdom, and confessed, under the cimeter of Omar, that he was
the apostle of the true God. The return of Marius and Scylla was stained
with the blood of the Romans: the revenge of Mahomet was stimulated by
religious zeal, and his injured followers were eager to execute or to
prevent the order of a massacre. Instead of indulging their passions and
his own, <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a> the victorious exile forgave the guilt, and united the
factions, of Mecca. His troops, in three divisions, marched into the
city: eight-and-twenty of the inhabitants were slain by the sword of
Caled; eleven men and six women were proscribed by the sentence of
Mahomet; but he blamed the cruelty of his lieutenant; and several of the
most obnoxious victims were indebted for their lives to his clemency or
contempt. The chiefs of the Koreish were prostrate at his feet. "What
mercy can you expect from the man whom you have wronged?" "We confide
in the generosity of our kinsman." "And you shall not confide in vain:
begone! you are safe, you are free" The people of Mecca deserved their
pardon by the profession of Islam; and after an exile of seven years,
the fugitive missionary was enthroned as the prince and prophet of his
native country. <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a> But the three hundred and sixty idols of the Caaba
were ignominiously broken: the house of God was purified and adorned: as
an example to future times, the apostle again fulfilled the duties of a
pilgrim; and a perpetual law was enacted that no unbeliever should dare
to set his foot on the territory of the holy city. <a href="#note-141" name="noteref-141"><small>141</small></a>

The conquest of Mecca determined the faith and obedience of the Arabian
tribes; <a href="#note-142" name="noteref-142"><small>142</small></a> who, according to the vicissitudes of fortune, had obeyed,
or disregarded, the eloquence or the arms of the prophet. Indifference
for rites and opinions still marks the character of the Bedoweens; and
they might accept, as loosely as they hold, the doctrine of the Koran.
Yet an obstinate remnant still adhered to the religion and liberty of
their ancestors, and the war of Honain derived a proper appellation from
the idols, whom Mahomet had vowed to destroy, and whom the confederates
of Tayef had sworn to defend. <a href="#note-143" name="noteref-143"><small>143</small></a> Four thousand Pagans advanced with
secrecy and speed to surprise the conqueror: they pitied and despised
the supine negligence of the Koreish, but they depended on the wishes,
and perhaps the aid, of a people who had so lately renounced their gods,
and bowed beneath the yoke of their enemy. The banners of Medina and
Mecca were displayed by the prophet; a crowd of Bedoweens increased
the strength or numbers of the army, and twelve thousand Mussulmans
entertained a rash and sinful presumption of their invincible strength.
They descended without precaution into the valley of Honain: the heights
had been occupied by the archers and slingers of the confederates; their
numbers were oppressed, their discipline was confounded, their courage
was appalled, and the Koreish smiled at their impending destruction. The
prophet, on his white mule, was encompassed by the enemies: he attempted
to rush against their spears in search of a glorious death: ten of his
faithful companions interposed their weapons and their breasts; three of
these fell dead at his feet: "O my brethren," he repeatedly cried, with
sorrow and indignation, "I am the son of Abdallah, I am the apostle of
truth! O man, stand fast in the faith! O God, send down thy succor!" His
uncle Abbas, who, like the heroes of Homer, excelled in the loudness
of his voice, made the valley resound with the recital of the gifts and
promises of God: the flying Moslems returned from all sides to the holy
standard; and Mahomet observed with pleasure that the furnace was again
rekindled: his conduct and example restored the battle, and he animated
his victorious troops to inflict a merciless revenge on the authors of
their shame. From the field of Honain, he marched without delay to the
siege of Tayef, sixty miles to the south-east of Mecca, a fortress of
strength, whose fertile lands produce the fruits of Syria in the midst
of the Arabian desert. A friendly tribe, instructed (I know not how)
in the art of sieges, supplied him with a train of battering-rams and
military engines, with a body of five hundred artificers. But it was in
vain that he offered freedom to the slaves of Tayef; that he violated
his own laws by the extirpation of the fruit-trees; that the ground was
opened by the miners; that the breach was assaulted by the troops. After
a siege of twenty-days, the prophet sounded a retreat; but he retreated
with a song of devout triumph, and affected to pray for the repentance
and safety of the unbelieving city. The spoils of this fortunate
expedition amounted to six thousand captives, twenty-four thousand
camels, forty thousand sheep, and four thousand ounces of silver: a
tribe who had fought at Hoinan redeemed their prisoners by the sacrifice
of their idols; but Mahomet compensated the loss, by resigning to the
soldiers his fifth of the plunder, and wished, for their sake, that he
possessed as many head of cattle as there were trees in the province
of Tehama. Instead of chastising the disaffection of the Koreish, he
endeavored to cut out their tongues, (his own expression,) and to secure
their attachment by a superior measure of liberality: Abu Sophian alone
was presented with three hundred camels and twenty ounces of silver; and
Mecca was sincerely converted to the profitable religion of the Koran.

The fugitives and auxiliaries complained, that they who had borne the
burden were neglected in the season of victory "Alas!" replied their
artful leader, "suffer me to conciliate these recent enemies, these
doubtful proselytes, by the gift of some perishable goods. To your guard
I intrust my life and fortunes. You are the companions of my exile, of
my kingdom, of my paradise." He was followed by the deputies of Tayef,
who dreaded the repetition of a siege. "Grant us, O apostle of God! a
truce of three years, with the toleration of our ancient worship."
"Not a month, not an hour." "Excuse us at least from the obligation of
prayer." "Without prayer religion is of no avail." They submitted
in silence: their temples were demolished, and the same sentence of
destruction was executed on all the idols of Arabia. His lieutenants,
on the shores of the Red Sea, the Ocean, and the Gulf of Persia, were
saluted by the acclamations of a faithful people; and the ambassadors,
who knelt before the throne of Medina, were as numerous (says the
Arabian proverb) as the dates that fall from the maturity of a
palm-tree. The nation submitted to the God and the sceptre of Mahomet:
the opprobrious name of tribute was abolished: the spontaneous or
reluctant oblations of arms and tithes were applied to the service of
religion; and one hundred and fourteen thousand Moslems accompanied the

<p>
When Heraclius returned in triumph from the Persian war, he entertained,
at Emesa, one of the ambassadors of Mahomet, who invited the princes and
nations of the earth to the profession of Islam. On this foundation the
zeal of the Arabians has supposed the secret conversion of the Christian
emperor: the vanity of the Greeks has feigned a personal visit of the
prince of Medina, who accepted from the royal bounty a rich domain, and
a secure retreat, in the province of Syria. <a href="#note-145" name="noteref-145"><small>145</small></a> But the friendship
of Heraclius and Mahomet was of short continuance: the new religion had
inflamed rather than assuaged the rapacious spirit of the Saracens, and
the murder of an envoy afforded a decent pretence for invading, with
three thousand soldiers, the territory of Palestine, that extends to the
eastward of the Jordan. The holy banner was intrusted to Zeid; and such
was the discipline or enthusiasm of the rising sect, that the noblest
chiefs served without reluctance under the slave of the prophet. On the
event of his decease, Jaafar and Abdallah were successively substituted
to the command; and if the three should perish in the war, the troops
were authorized to elect their general. The three leaders were slain
in the battle of Muta, <a href="#note-146" name="noteref-146"><small>146</small></a> the first military action, which tried the
valor of the Moslems against a foreign enemy. Zeid fell, like a soldier,
in the foremost ranks: the death of Jaafar was heroic and memorable: he
lost his right hand: he shifted the standard to his left: the left
was severed from his body: he embraced the standard with his bleeding
stumps, till he was transfixed to the ground with fifty honorable
wounds. <a href="#note-1461" name="noteref-1461"><small>1461</small></a> "Advance," cried Abdallah, who stepped into the vacant
place, "advance with confidence: either victory or paradise is our own."
The lance of a Roman decided the alternative; but the falling standard
was rescued by Caled, the proselyte of Mecca: nine swords were broken in
his hand; and his valor withstood and repulsed the superior numbers of
the Christians. In the nocturnal council of the camp he was chosen to
command: his skilful evolutions of the ensuing day secured either the
victory or the retreat of the Saracens; and Caled is renowned among his
brethren and his enemies by the glorious appellation of the Sword of
God. In the pulpit, Mahomet described, with prophetic rapture, the
crowns of the blessed martyrs; but in private he betrayed the feelings
of human nature: he was surprised as he wept over the daughter of Zeid:
"What do I see?" said the astonished votary. "You see," replied the
apostle, "a friend who is deploring the loss of his most faithful
friend." After the conquest of Mecca, the sovereign of Arabia affected
to prevent the hostile preparations of Heraclius; and solemnly
proclaimed war against the Romans, without attempting to disguise
the hardships and dangers of the enterprise. <a href="#note-147" name="noteref-147"><small>147</small></a> The Moslems were
discouraged: they alleged the want of money, or horses, or provisions;
the season of harvest, and the intolerable heat of the summer: "Hell is
much hotter," said the indignant prophet. He disdained to compel
their service: but on his return he admonished the most guilty, by an
excommunication of fifty days. Their desertion enhanced the merit of
Abubeker, Othman, and the faithful companions who devoted their lives
and fortunes; and Mahomet displayed his banner at the head of ten
thousand horse and twenty thousand foot. Painful indeed was the distress
of the march: lassitude and thirst were aggravated by the scorching and
pestilential winds of the desert: ten men rode by turns on one camel;
and they were reduced to the shameful necessity of drinking the water
from the belly of that useful animal. In the mid-way, ten days' journey
from Medina and Damascus, they reposed near the grove and fountain of
Tabuc. Beyond that place Mahomet declined the prosecution of the war:
he declared himself satisfied with the peaceful intentions, he was more
probably daunted by the martial array, of the emperor of the East. But
the active and intrepid Caled spread around the terror of his name; and
the prophet received the submission of the tribes and cities, from
the Euphrates to Ailah, at the head of the Red Sea. To his Christian
subjects, Mahomet readily granted the security of their persons, the
freedom of their trade, the property of their goods, and the toleration
of their worship. <a href="#note-148" name="noteref-148"><small>148</small></a> The weakness of their Arabian brethren had
restrained them from opposing his ambition; the disciples of Jesus
were endeared to the enemy of the Jews; and it was the interest of a
conqueror to propose a fair capitulation to the most powerful religion
of the earth.

<p>
Till the age of sixty-three years, the strength of Mahomet was equal to
the temporal and spiritual fatigues of his mission. His epileptic fits,
an absurd calumny of the Greeks, would be an object of pity rather than
abhorrence; <a href="#note-149" name="noteref-149"><small>149</small></a> but he seriously believed that he was poisoned at
Chaibar by the revenge of a Jewish female. <a href="#note-150" name="noteref-150"><small>150</small></a> During four years,
the health of the prophet declined; his infirmities increased; but
his mortal disease was a fever of fourteen days, which deprived him
by intervals of the use of reason. As soon as he was conscious of
his danger, he edified his brethren by the humility of his virtue or
penitence. "If there be any man," said the apostle from the pulpit,
"whom I have unjustly scourged, I submit my own back to the lash of
retaliation. Have I aspersed the reputation of a Mussulman? let him
proclaim my thoughts in the face of the congregation. Has any one been
despoiled of his goods? the little that I possess shall compensate the
principal and the interest of the debt." "Yes," replied a voice from
the crowd, "I am entitled to three drams of silver." Mahomet heard the
complaint, satisfied the demand, and thanked his creditor for accusing
him in this world rather than at the day of judgment. He beheld with
temperate firmness the approach of death; enfranchised his slaves
(seventeen men, as they are named, and eleven women;) minutely directed
the order of his funeral, and moderated the lamentations of his weeping
friends, on whom he bestowed the benediction of peace. Till the third
day before his death, he regularly performed the function of public
prayer: the choice of Abubeker to supply his place, appeared to mark
that ancient and faithful friend as his successor in the sacerdotal
and regal office; but he prudently declined the risk and envy of a
more explicit nomination. At a moment when his faculties were visibly
impaired, he called for pen and ink to write, or, more properly,
to dictate, a divine book, the sum and accomplishment of all his
revelations: a dispute arose in the chamber, whether he should be
allowed to supersede the authority of the Koran; and the prophet was
forced to reprove the indecent vehemence of his disciples. If the
slightest credit may be afforded to the traditions of his wives and
companions, he maintained, in the bosom of his family, and to the last
moments of his life, the dignity <a href="#note-1501" name="noteref-1501"><small>1501</small></a> of an apostle, and the faith of
an enthusiast; described the visits of Gabriel, who bade an everlasting
farewell to the earth, and expressed his lively confidence, not only
of the mercy, but of the favor, of the Supreme Being. In a familiar
discourse he had mentioned his special prerogative, that the angel of
death was not allowed to take his soul till he had respectfully asked
the permission of the prophet. The request was granted; and Mahomet
immediately fell into the agony of his dissolution: his head was
reclined on the lap of Ayesha, the best beloved of all his wives; he
fainted with the violence of pain; recovering his spirits, he raised his
eyes towards the roof of the house, and, with a steady look, though a
faltering voice, uttered the last broken, though articulate, words:
"O God!..... pardon my sins....... Yes, ...... I come,...... among my
fellow-citizens on high;" and thus peaceably expired on a carpet spread
upon the floor. An expedition for the conquest of Syria was stopped by
this mournful event; the army halted at the gates of Medina; the chiefs
were assembled round their dying master. The city, more especially
the house, of the prophet, was a scene of clamorous sorrow of silent
despair: fanaticism alone could suggest a ray of hope and consolation.
"How can he be dead, our witness, our intercessor, our mediator, with
God? By God he is not dead: like Moses and Jesus, he is wrapped in a
holy trance, and speedily will he return to his faithful people." The
evidence of sense was disregarded; and Omar, unsheathing his cimeter,
threatened to strike off the heads of the infidels, who should dare
to affirm that the prophet was no more. The tumult was appeased by the
weight and moderation of Abubeker. "Is it Mahomet," said he to Omar and
the multitude, "or the God of Mahomet, whom you worship? The God of
Mahomet liveth forever; but the apostle was a mortal like ourselves, and
according to his own prediction, he has experienced the common fate of
mortality." He was piously interred by the hands of his nearest kinsman,
on the same spot on which he expired: <a href="#note-151" name="noteref-151"><small>151</small></a> Medina has been sanctified

any proofs of that meek and heroic firmness which might be expected to
dignify and embellish the last moments of the apostle of God. On some

impatience, as are in general to be found in men only of the most
ordinary stamp; and such as extorted from his wife Ayesha, in
particular, the sarcastic remark, that in herself, or any of her

</p>
<p>
At the conclusion of the life of Mahomet, it may perhaps be expected,
that I should balance his faults and virtues, that I should decide
whether the title of enthusiast or impostor more properly belongs to
that extraordinary man. Had I been intimately conversant with the son of
Abdallah, the task would still be difficult, and the success uncertain:
at the distance of twelve centuries, I darkly contemplate his shade
through a cloud of religious incense; and could I truly delineate the
portrait of an hour, the fleeting resemblance would not equally apply
to the solitary of Mount Hera, to the preacher of Mecca, and to the
conqueror of Arabia. The author of a mighty revolution appears to have
been endowed with a pious and contemplative disposition: so soon as
marriage had raised him above the pressure of want, he avoided the
paths of ambition and avarice; and till the age of forty he lived with
innocence, and would have died without a name. The unity of God is an
idea most congenial to nature and reason; and a slight conversation
with the Jews and Christians would teach him to despise and detest the
idolatry of Mecca. It was the duty of a man and a citizen to impart the
doctrine of salvation, to rescue his country from the dominion of sin
and error. The energy of a mind incessantly bent on the same object,
would convert a general obligation into a particular call; the warm
suggestions of the understanding or the fancy would be felt as the
inspirations of Heaven; the labor of thought would expire in rapture
and vision; and the inward sensation, the invisible monitor, would be
described with the form and attributes of an angel of God. <a href="#note-154" name="noteref-154"><small>154</small></a> From
enthusiasm to imposture, the step is perilous and slippery: the daemon
of Socrates <a href="#note-155" name="noteref-155"><small>155</small></a> affords a memorable instance, how a wise man may
deceive himself, how a good man may deceive others, how the conscience
may slumber in a mixed and middle state between self-illusion and
voluntary fraud. Charity may believe that the original motives of
Mahomet were those of pure and genuine benevolence; but a human
missionary is incapable of cherishing the obstinate unbelievers who
reject his claims despise his arguments, and persecute his life; he
might forgive his personal adversaries, he may lawfully hate the enemies
of God; the stern passions of pride and revenge were kindled in the
bosom of Mahomet, and he sighed, like the prophet of Nineveh, for the
destruction of the rebels whom he had condemned. The injustice of Mecca
and the choice of Medina, transformed the citizen into a prince, the
humble preacher into the leader of armies; but his sword was consecrated
by the example of the saints; and the same God who afflicts a sinful
world with pestilence and earthquakes, might inspire for their
conversion or chastisement the valor of his servants. In the exercise
of political government, he was compelled to abate of the stern rigor of
fanaticism, to comply in some measure with the prejudices and passions
of his followers, and to employ even the vices of mankind as the
instruments of their salvation. The use of fraud and perfidy, of cruelty
and injustice, were often subservient to the propagation of the faith;
and Mahomet commanded or approved the assassination of the Jews and
idolaters who had escaped from the field of battle. By the repetition
of such acts, the character of Mahomet must have been gradually stained;
and the influence of such pernicious habits would be poorly compensated
by the practice of the personal and social virtues which are necessary
to maintain the reputation of a prophet among his sectaries and friends.
Of his last years, ambition was the ruling passion; and a politician
will suspect, that he secretly smiled (the victorious impostor!) at the
enthusiasm of his youth, and the credulity of his proselytes. <a href="#note-156" name="noteref-156"><small>156</small></a> A
philosopher will observe, that their credulity and his success would
tend more strongly to fortify the assurance of his divine mission,
that his interest and religion were inseparably connected, and that
his conscience would be soothed by the persuasion, that he alone was
absolved by the Deity from the obligation of positive and moral laws. If
he retained any vestige of his native innocence, the sins of Mahomet may
be allowed as an evidence of his sincerity. In the support of truth, the
arts of fraud and fiction may be deemed less criminal; and he would have
started at the foulness of the means, had he not been satisfied of the
importance and justice of the end. Even in a conqueror or a priest, I
can surprise a word or action of unaffected humanity; and the decree
of Mahomet, that, in the sale of captives, the mothers should never be
separated from their children, may suspend, or moderate, the censure of
the historian. <a href="#note-157" name="noteref-157"><small>157</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.&mdash;Part VII.
</h2>
<p>
The good sense of Mahomet <a href="#note-158" name="noteref-158"><small>158</small></a> despised the pomp of royalty: the
apostle of God submitted to the menial offices of the family: he kindled
the fire, swept the floor, milked the ewes, and mended with his own
hands his shoes and his woollen garment. Disdaining the penance and
merit of a hermit, he observed, without effort or vanity, the abstemious
diet of an Arab and a soldier. On solemn occasions he feasted his
companions with rustic and hospitable plenty; but in his domestic life,
many weeks would elapse without a tire being kindled on the hearth of
the prophet. The interdiction of wine was confirmed by his example;
his hunger was appeased with a sparing allowance of barley-bread:
he delighted in the taste of milk and honey; but his ordinary food
consisted of dates and water. Perfumes and women were the two sensual
enjoyments which his nature required, and his religion did not forbid;
and Mahomet affirmed, that the fervor of his devotion was increased by
these innocent pleasures. The heat of the climate inflames the blood
of the Arabs; and their libidinous complexion has been noticed by the
writers of antiquity. <a href="#note-159" name="noteref-159"><small>159</small></a> Their incontinence was regulated by the
civil and religious laws of the Koran: their incestuous alliances were
blamed; the boundless license of polygamy was reduced to four legitimate
wives or concubines; their rights both of bed and of dowry were
equitably determined; the freedom of divorce was discouraged, adultery
was condemned as a capital offence; and fornication, in either sex, was
punished with a hundred stripes. <a href="#note-160" name="noteref-160"><small>160</small></a> Such were the calm and rational
precepts of the legislator: but in his private conduct, Mahomet indulged
the appetites of a man, and abused the claims of a prophet. A special
revelation dispensed him from the laws which he had imposed on his
nation: the female sex, without reserve, was abandoned to his desires;
and this singular prerogative excited the envy, rather than the scandal,
the veneration, rather than the envy, of the devout Mussulmans. If we
remember the seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines of the
wise Solomon, we shall applaud the modesty of the Arabian, who espoused
no more than seventeen or fifteen wives; eleven are enumerated who
occupied at Medina their separate apartments round the house of the
apostle, and enjoyed in their turns the favor of his conjugal society.
What is singular enough, they were all widows, excepting only Ayesha,
the daughter of Abubeker. She was doubtless a virgin, since Mahomet
consummated his nuptials (such is the premature ripeness of the climate)
when she was only nine years of age. The youth, the beauty, the spirit
of Ayesha, gave her a superior ascendant: she was beloved and trusted
by the prophet; and, after his death, the daughter of Abubeker was long
revered as the mother of the faithful. Her behavior had been ambiguous
and indiscreet: in a nocturnal march she was accidentally left behind;
and in the morning Ayesha returned to the camp with a man. The temper of
Mahomet was inclined to jealousy; but a divine revelation assured him
of her innocence: he chastised her accusers, and published a law of
domestic peace, that no woman should be condemned unless four male
witnesses had seen her in the act of adultery. <a href="#note-161" name="noteref-161"><small>161</small></a> In his adventures
with Zeineb, the wife of Zeid, and with Mary, an Egyptian captive, the
amorous prophet forgot the interest of his reputation. At the house of
Zeid, his freedman and adopted son, he beheld, in a loose undress, the
beauty of Zeineb, and burst forth into an ejaculation of devotion and
desire. The servile, or grateful, freedman understood the hint, and
yielded without hesitation to the love of his benefactor. But as the
filial relation had excited some doubt and scandal, the angel Gabriel
descended from heaven to ratify the deed, to annul the adoption, and
gently to reprove the apostle for distrusting the indulgence of his God.
One of his wives, Hafna, the daughter of Omar, surprised him on her own
bed, in the embraces of his Egyptian captive: she promised secrecy and
forgiveness, he swore that he would renounce the possession of Mary.
Both parties forgot their engagements; and Gabriel again descended with
a chapter of the Koran, to absolve him from his oath, and to exhort him
freely to enjoy his captives and concubines, without listening to the
clamors of his wives. In a solitary retreat of thirty days, he labored,
alone with Mary, to fulfil the commands of the angel. When his love and
revenge were satiated, he summoned to his presence his eleven wives,
reproached their disobedience and indiscretion, and threatened them with
a sentence of divorce, both in this world and in the next; a dreadful
sentence, since those who had ascended the bed of the prophet were
forever excluded from the hope of a second marriage. Perhaps the
incontinence of Mahomet may be palliated by the tradition of his natural
or preternatural gifts; <a href="#note-162" name="noteref-162"><small>162</small></a> he united the manly virtue of thirty of
the children of Adam: and the apostle might rival the thirteenth labor
<a href="#note-163" name="noteref-163"><small>163</small></a> of the Grecian Hercules. <a href="#note-164" name="noteref-164"><small>164</small></a> A more serious and decent excuse
may be drawn from his fidelity to Cadijah. During the twenty-four years
of their marriage, her youthful husband abstained from the right of
polygamy, and the pride or tenderness of the venerable matron was never
insulted by the society of a rival. After her death, he placed her in
the rank of the four perfect women, with the sister of Moses, the mother
of Jesus, and Fatima, the best beloved of his daughters. "Was she not
old?" said Ayesha, with the insolence of a blooming beauty; "has not God
given you a better in her place?" "No, by God," said Mahomet, with an
effusion of honest gratitude, "there never can be a better! She believed
in me when men despised me; she relieved my wants, when I was poor and
persecuted by the world." <a href="#note-165" name="noteref-165"><small>165</small></a>

In the largest indulgence of polygamy, the founder of a religion and
empire might aspire to multiply the chances of a numerous posterity and
a lineal succession. The hopes of Mahomet were fatally disappointed. The
virgin Ayesha, and his ten widows of mature age and approved fertility,
were barren in his potent embraces. The four sons of Cadijah died in
their infancy. Mary, his Egyptian concubine, was endeared to him by the
birth of Ibrahim. At the end of fifteen months the prophet wept over his
grave; but he sustained with firmness the raillery of his enemies, and
checked the adulation or credulity of the Moslems, by the assurance that
an eclipse of the sun was not occasioned by the death of the infant.
Cadijah had likewise given him four daughters, who were married to
the most faithful of his disciples: the three eldest died before their
father; but Fatima, who possessed his confidence and love, became the
wife of her cousin Ali, and the mother of an illustrious progeny.
The merit and misfortunes of Ali and his descendants will lead me to
anticipate, in this place, the series of the Saracen caliphs, a title

The birth, the alliance, the character of Ali, which exalted him above
the rest of his countrymen, might justify his claim to the vacant throne
of Arabia. The son of Abu Taleb was, in his own right, the chief of the
family of Hashem, and the hereditary prince or guardian of the city and
temple of Mecca. The light of prophecy was extinct; but the husband
of Fatima might expect the inheritance and blessing of her father:
the Arabs had sometimes been patient of a female reign; and the two
grandsons of the prophet had often been fondled in his lap, and shown
in his pulpit as the hope of his age, and the chief of the youth of
paradise. The first of the true believers might aspire to march before
them in this world and in the next; and if some were of a graver and
more rigid cast, the zeal and virtue of Ali were never outstripped by
any recent proselyte. He united the qualifications of a poet, a soldier,
and a saint: his wisdom still breathes in a collection of moral and
religious sayings; <a href="#note-167" name="noteref-167"><small>167</small></a> and every antagonist, in the combats of the
tongue or of the sword, was subdued by his eloquence and valor. From the
first hour of his mission to the last rites of his funeral, the apostle
was never forsaken by a generous friend, whom he delighted to name his
brother, his vicegerent, and the faithful Aaron of a second Moses. The
son of Abu Taleb was afterwards reproached for neglecting to secure his
interest by a solemn declaration of his right, which would have silenced
all competition, and sealed his succession by the decrees of Heaven. But
the unsuspecting hero confided in himself: the jealousy of empire,
and perhaps the fear of opposition, might suspend the resolutions of
Mahomet; and the bed of sickness was besieged by the artful Ayesha, the
daughter of Abubeker, and the enemy of Ali. <a href="#note-1671" name="noteref-1671"><small>1671</small></a>

[ Gibbon wrote chiefly from the Arabic or Sunnite account
of these transactions, the only sources accessible at the time when he
composed his History. Major Price, writing from Persian authorities,
affords us the advantage of comparing throughout what may be fairly
considered the Shiite Version. The glory of Ali is the constant burden
of their strain. He was destined, and, according to some accounts,
designated, for the caliphate by the prophet; but while the others were
fiercely pushing their own interests, Ali was watching the remains of
Mahomet with pious fidelity. His disinterested magnanimity, on each
separate occasion, declined the sceptre, and gave the noble example of
obedience to the appointed caliph. He is described, in retirement,
on the throne, and in the field of battle, as transcendently pious,
magnanimous, valiant, and humane. He lost his empire through his excess
of virtue and love for the faithful his life through his confidence in

The silence and death of the prophet restored the liberty of the people;
and his companions convened an assembly to deliberate on the choice
of his successor. The hereditary claim and lofty spirit of Ali were
offensive to an aristocracy of elders, desirous of bestowing and
resuming the sceptre by a free and frequent election: the Koreish could
never be reconciled to the proud preeminence of the line of Hashem; the
ancient discord of the tribes was rekindled, the fugitives of Mecca and
the auxiliaries of Medina asserted their respective merits; and the rash
proposal of choosing two independent caliphs would have crushed in their
infancy the religion and empire of the Saracens. The tumult was appeased
by the disinterested resolution of Omar, who, suddenly renouncing his
own pretensions, stretched forth his hand, and declared himself the
first subject of the mild and venerable Abubeker. <a href="#note-1672" name="noteref-1672"><small>1672</small></a> The urgency
of the moment, and the acquiescence of the people, might excuse this
illegal and precipitate measure; but Omar himself confessed from the
pulpit, that if any Mulsulman should hereafter presume to anticipate
the suffrage of his brethren, both the elector and the elected would be
worthy of death. <a href="#note-168" name="noteref-168"><small>168</small></a> After the simple inauguration of Abubeker, he
was obeyed in Medina, Mecca, and the provinces of Arabia: the Hashemites
alone declined the oath of fidelity; and their chief, in his own house,
maintained, above six months, a sullen and independent reserve; without
listening to the threats of Omar, who attempted to consume with fire the
habitation of the daughter of the apostle. The death of Fatima, and
the decline of his party, subdued the indignant spirit of Ali: he
condescended to salute the commander of the faithful, accepted his
excuse of the necessity of preventing their common enemies, and wisely
rejected his courteous offer of abdicating the government of the
Arabians. After a reign of two years, the aged caliph was summoned by
the angel of death. In his testament, with the tacit approbation of his
companions, he bequeathed the sceptre to the firm and intrepid virtue of
Omar. "I have no occasion," said the modest candidate, "for the place."
"But the place has occasion for you," replied Abubeker; who expired with
a fervent prayer, that the God of Mahomet would ratify his choice, and
direct the Mussulmans in the way of concord and obedience. The prayer
was not ineffectual, since Ali himself, in a life of privacy and prayer,
professed to revere the superior worth and dignity of his rival; who
comforted him for the loss of empire, by the most flattering marks of
confidence and esteem. In the twelfth year of his reign, Omar received
a mortal wound from the hand of an assassin: he rejected with equal
impartiality the names of his son and of Ali, refused to load his
conscience with the sins of his successor, and devolved on six of the
most respectable companions the arduous task of electing a commander
of the faithful. On this occasion, Ali was again blamed by his friends
<a href="#note-169" name="noteref-169"><small>169</small></a> for submitting his right to the judgment of men, for recognizing
their jurisdiction by accepting a place among the six electors. He might
have obtained their suffrage, had he deigned to promise a strict and
servile conformity, not only to the Koran and tradition, but likewise to
the determinations of two seniors. <a href="#note-170" name="noteref-170"><small>170</small></a> With these limitations, Othman,
the secretary of Mahomet, accepted the government; nor was it till after
the third caliph, twenty-four years after the death of the prophet, that
Ali was invested, by the popular choice, with the regal and sacerdotal
office. The manners of the Arabians retained their primitive simplicity,
and the son of Abu Taleb despised the pomp and vanity of this world.
At the hour of prayer, he repaired to the mosch of Medina, clothed in a
thin cotton gown, a coarse turban on his head, his slippers in one hand,
and his bow in the other, instead of a walking-staff. The companions of
the prophet, and the chiefs of the tribes, saluted their new sovereign,
and gave him their right hands as a sign of fealty and allegiance.

<p>
The mischiefs that flow from the contests of ambition are usually
confined to the times and countries in which they have been agitated.
But the religious discord of the friends and enemies of Ali has been
renewed in every age of the Hegira, and is still maintained in the
immortal hatred of the Persians and Turks. <a href="#note-171" name="noteref-171"><small>171</small></a> The former, who are
branded with the appellation of Shiites or sectaries, have enriched
the Mahometan creed with a new article of faith; and if Mahomet be
the apostle, his companion Ali is the vicar, of God. In their private
converse, in their public worship, they bitterly execrate the three
usurpers who intercepted his indefeasible right to the dignity of Imam
and Caliph; and the name of Omar expresses in their tongue the perfect
accomplishment of wickedness and impiety. <a href="#note-172" name="noteref-172"><small>172</small></a> The Sonnites, who
are supported by the general consent and orthodox tradition of the
Mussulmans, entertain a more impartial, or at least a more decent,
opinion. They respect the memory of Abubeker, Omar, Othman, and Ali, the
holy and legitimate successors of the prophet. But they assign the last
and most humble place to the husband of Fatima, in the persuasion that
the order of succession was determined by the decrees of sanctity.
<a href="#note-173" name="noteref-173"><small>173</small></a> An historian who balances the four caliphs with a hand unshaken by
superstition, will calmly pronounce that their manners were alike pure
and exemplary; that their zeal was fervent, and probably sincere; and
that, in the midst of riches and power, their lives were devoted to
the practice of moral and religious duties. But the public virtues
of Abubeker and Omar, the prudence of the first, the severity of the
second, maintained the peace and prosperity of their reigns. The feeble
temper and declining age of Othman were incapable of sustaining the
weight of conquest and empire. He chose, and he was deceived; he
trusted, and he was betrayed: the most deserving of the faithful
became useless or hostile to his government, and his lavish bounty was
productive only of ingratitude and discontent. The spirit of discord
went forth in the provinces: their deputies assembled at Medina; and
the Charegites, the desperate fanatics who disclaimed the yoke of
subordination and reason, were confounded among the free-born Arabs,
who demanded the redress of their wrongs and the punishment of their
oppressors. From Cufa, from Bassora, from Egypt, from the tribes of
the desert, they rose in arms, encamped about a league from Medina,
and despatched a haughty mandate to their sovereign, requiring him to
execute justice, or to descend from the throne. His repentance began to
disarm and disperse the insurgents; but their fury was rekindled by
the arts of his enemies; and the forgery of a perfidious secretary was
contrived to blast his reputation and precipitate his fall. The caliph
had lost the only guard of his predecessors, the esteem and confidence
of the Moslems: during a siege of six weeks his water and provisions
were intercepted, and the feeble gates of the palace were protected only
by the scruples of the more timorous rebels. Forsaken by those who had
abused his simplicity, the hopeless and venerable caliph expected the
approach of death: the brother of Ayesha marched at the head of the
assassins; and Othman, with the Koran in his lap, was pierced with
a multitude of wounds. <a href="#note-1731" name="noteref-1731"><small>1731</small></a> A tumultuous anarchy of five days was
appeased by the inauguration of Ali: his refusal would have provoked a
general massacre. In this painful situation he supported the becoming
pride of the chief of the Hashemites; declared that he had rather serve
than reign; rebuked the presumption of the strangers; and required the
formal, if not the voluntary, assent of the chiefs of the nation. He
has never been accused of prompting the assassin of Omar; though Persia
indiscreetly celebrates the festival of that holy martyr. The quarrel
between Othman and his subjects was assuaged by the early mediation of
Ali; and Hassan, the eldest of his sons, was insulted and wounded in the
defence of the caliph. Yet it is doubtful whether the father of Hassan
was strenuous and sincere in his opposition to the rebels; and it is
certain that he enjoyed the benefit of their crime. The temptation was
indeed of such magnitude as might stagger and corrupt the most obdurate
virtue. The ambitious candidate no longer aspired to the barren sceptre
of Arabia; the Saracens had been victorious in the East and West; and
the wealthy kingdoms of Persia, Syria, and Egypt were the patrimony of
the commander of the faithful.

<h2>
    Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.&mdash;Part VIII.
</h2>
<p>
A life of prayer and contemplation had not chilled the martial activity
of Ali; but in a mature age, after a long experience of mankind, he
still betrayed in his conduct the rashness and indiscretion of youth.
<a href="#note-1732" name="noteref-1732"><small>1732</small></a> In the first days of his reign, he neglected to secure, either
by gifts or fetters, the doubtful allegiance of Telha and Zobeir, two
of the most powerful of the Arabian chiefs. They escaped from Medina to
Mecca, and from thence to Bassora; erected the standard of revolt;
and usurped the government of Irak, or Assyria, which they had vainly
solicited as the reward of their services. The mask of patriotism is
allowed to cover the most glaring inconsistencies; and the enemies,
perhaps the assassins, of Othman now demanded vengeance for his blood.
They were accompanied in their flight by Ayesha, the widow of the
prophet, who cherished, to the last hour of her life, an implacable
hatred against the husband and the posterity of Fatima. The most
reasonable Moslems were scandalized, that the mother of the faithful
should expose in a camp her person and character; <a href="#note-1733" name="noteref-1733"><small>1733</small></a> but the
superstitious crowd was confident that her presence would sanctify the
justice, and assure the success, of their cause. At the head of twenty
thousand of his loyal Arabs, and nine thousand valiant auxiliaries of
Cufa, the caliph encountered and defeated the superior numbers of the
rebels under the walls of Bassora. <a href="#note-1734" name="noteref-1734"><small>1734</small></a> Their leaders, Telha and
Zobeir, <a href="#note-1735" name="noteref-1735"><small>1735</small></a> were slain in the first battle that stained with civil
blood the arms of the Moslems. <a href="#note-1736" name="noteref-1736"><small>1736</small></a> After passing through the ranks to
animate the troops, Ayesha had chosen her post amidst the dangers of the
field. In the heat of the action, seventy men, who held the bridle of
her camel, were successively killed or wounded; and the cage or litter,
in which she sat, was stuck with javelins and darts like the quills of a
porcupine. The venerable captive sustained with firmness the reproaches
of the conqueror, and was speedily dismissed to her proper station at
the tomb of Mahomet, with the respect and tenderness that was still due
to the widow of the apostle. <a href="#note-1737" name="noteref-1737"><small>1737</small></a> After this victory, which was styled
the Day of the Camel, Ali marched against a more formidable adversary;
against Moawiyah, the son of Abu Sophian, who had assumed the title of
caliph, and whose claim was supported by the forces of Syria and the
interest of the house of Ommiyah. From the passage of Thapsacus, the
plain of Siffin <a href="#note-174" name="noteref-174"><small>174</small></a> extends along the western bank of the Euphrates.
On this spacious and level theatre, the two competitors waged a
desultory war of one hundred and ten days. In the course of ninety
actions or skirmishes, the loss of Ali was estimated at twenty-five,
that of Moawiyah at forty-five, thousand soldiers; and the list of the
slain was dignified with the names of five-and-twenty veterans who
had fought at Beder under the standard of Mahomet. In this sanguinary
contest the lawful caliph displayed a superior character of valor and
humanity. <a href="#note-1741" name="noteref-1741"><small>1741</small></a> His troops were strictly enjoined to await the first
onset of the enemy, to spare their flying brethren, and to respect
the bodies of the dead, and the chastity of the female captives. He
generously proposed to save the blood of the Moslems by a single
combat; but his trembling rival declined the challenge as a sentence of
inevitable death. The ranks of the Syrians were broken by the charge of
a hero who was mounted on a piebald horse, and wielded with irresistible
force his ponderous and two-edged sword. As often as he smote a rebel,
he shouted the Allah Acbar, "God is victorious!" and in the tumult of
a nocturnal battle, he was heard to repeat four hundred times that
tremendous exclamation. The prince of Damascus already meditated his
flight; but the certain victory was snatched from the grasp of Ali by
the disobedience and enthusiasm of his troops. Their conscience was awed
by the solemn appeal to the books of the Koran which Moawiyah exposed
on the foremost lances; and Ali was compelled to yield to a disgraceful
truce and an insidious compromise. He retreated with sorrow and
indignation to Cufa; his party was discouraged; the distant provinces
of Persia, of Yemen, and of Egypt, were subdued or seduced by his crafty
rival; and the stroke of fanaticism, which was aimed against the three
chiefs of the nation, was fatal only to the cousin of Mahomet. In the
temple of Mecca, three Charegites or enthusiasts discoursed of the
disorders of the church and state: they soon agreed, that the deaths of
Ali, of Moawiyah, and of his friend Amrou, the viceroy of Egypt, would
restore the peace and unity of religion. Each of the assassins chose his
victim, poisoned his dagger, devoted his life, and secretly repaired
to the scene of action. Their resolution was equally desperate: but the
first mistook the person of Amrou, and stabbed the deputy who occupied
his seat; the prince of Damascus was dangerously hurt by the second; the
lawful caliph, in the mosch of Cufa, received a mortal wound from the
hand of the third. He expired in the sixty-third year of his age, and
mercifully recommended to his children, that they would despatch the
murderer by a single stroke. <a href="#note-1742" name="noteref-1742"><small>1742</small></a> The sepulchre of Ali <a href="#note-175" name="noteref-175"><small>175</small></a> was
concealed from the tyrants of the house of Ommiyah; <a href="#note-176" name="noteref-176"><small>176</small></a> but in the
fourth age of the Hegira, a tomb, a temple, a city, arose near the ruins
of Cufa. <a href="#note-177" name="noteref-177"><small>177</small></a> Many thousands of the Shiites repose in holy ground at
the feet of the vicar of God; and the desert is vivified by the numerous
and annual visits of the Persians, who esteem their devotion not less
meritorious than the pilgrimage of Mecca.

became desperate; forced their way through that part of the hostile army
which commanded the river, and in their turn entirely cut off the

The persecutors of Mahomet usurped the inheritance of his children; and
the champions of idolatry became the supreme heads of his religion and
empire. The opposition of Abu Sophian had been fierce and obstinate;
his conversion was tardy and reluctant; his new faith was fortified by
necessity and interest; he served, he fought, perhaps he believed; and
the sins of the time of ignorance were expiated by the recent merits
of the family of Ommiyah. Moawiyah, the son of Abu Sophian, and of the
cruel Henda, was dignified, in his early youth, with the office or title
of secretary of the prophet: the judgment of Omar intrusted him with the
government of Syria; and he administered that important province above
forty years, either in a subordinate or supreme rank. Without renouncing
the fame of valor and liberality, he affected the reputation of humanity
and moderation: a grateful people was attached to their benefactor;
and the victorious Moslems were enriched with the spoils of Cyprus and
Rhodes. The sacred duty of pursuing the assassins of Othman was the
engine and pretence of his ambition. The bloody shirt of the martyr
was exposed in the mosch of Damascus: the emir deplored the fate of his
injured kinsman; and sixty thousand Syrians were engaged in his service
by an oath of fidelity and revenge. Amrou, the conqueror of Egypt,
himself an army, was the first who saluted the new monarch, and
divulged the dangerous secret, that the Arabian caliphs might be created
elsewhere than in the city of the prophet. <a href="#note-178" name="noteref-178"><small>178</small></a> The policy of
Moawiyah eluded the valor of his rival; and, after the death of Ali, he
negotiated the abdication of his son Hassan, whose mind was either above
or below the government of the world, and who retired without a
sigh from the palace of Cufa to an humble cell near the tomb of his
grandfather. The aspiring wishes of the caliph were finally crowned
by the important change of an elective to an hereditary kingdom. Some
murmurs of freedom or fanaticism attested the reluctance of the Arabs,
and four citizens of Medina refused the oath of fidelity; but the
designs of Moawiyah were conducted with vigor and address; and his son
Yezid, a feeble and dissolute youth, was proclaimed as the commander of
the faithful and the successor on the apostle of God.

A familiar story is related of the benevolence of one of the sons of
Ali. In serving at table, a slave had inadvertently dropped a dish of
scalding broth on his master: the heedless wretch fell prostrate, to
deprecate his punishment, and repeated a verse of the Koran: "Paradise
is for those who command their anger: "&mdash;"I am not angry: "&mdash;"and for
those who pardon offences: "&mdash;"I pardon your offence: "&mdash;"and for those
who return good for evil: "&mdash;"I give you your liberty and four hundred
pieces of silver." With an equal measure of piety, Hosein, the younger
brother of Hassan, inherited a remnant of his father's spirit, and
served with honor against the Christians in the siege of Constantinople.
The primogeniture of the line of Hashem, and the holy character of
grandson of the apostle, had centred in his person, and he was at
liberty to prosecute his claim against Yezid, the tyrant of Damascus,
whose vices he despised, and whose title he had never deigned to
acknowledge. A list was secretly transmitted from Cufa to Medina, of one
hundred and forty thousand Moslems, who professed their attachment to
his cause, and who were eager to draw their swords so soon as he should
appear on the banks of the Euphrates. Against the advice of his wisest
friends, he resolved to trust his person and family in the hands of a
perfidious people. He traversed the desert of Arabia with a timorous
retinue of women and children; but as he approached the confines of
Irak he was alarmed by the solitary or hostile face of the country,
and suspected either the defection or ruin of his party. His fears
were just: Obeidollah, the governor of Cufa, had extinguished the first
sparks of an insurrection; and Hosein, in the plain of Kerbela, was
encompassed by a body of five thousand horse, who intercepted his
communication with the city and the river. He might still have escaped
to a fortress in the desert, that had defied the power of Caesar and
Chosroes, and confided in the fidelity of the tribe of Tai, which would
have armed ten thousand warriors in his defence.

In a conference with the chief of the enemy, he proposed the option
of three honorable conditions: that he should be allowed to return to
Medina, or be stationed in a frontier garrison against the Turks, or
safely conducted to the presence of Yezid. But the commands of the
caliph, or his lieutenant, were stern and absolute; and Hosein was
informed that he must either submit as a captive and a criminal to the
commander of the faithful, or expect the consequences of his rebellion.
"Do you think," replied he, "to terrify me with death?" And, during
the short respite of a night, <a href="#note-1781" name="noteref-1781"><small>1781</small></a> he prepared with calm and solemn
resignation to encounter his fate. He checked the lamentations of
his sister Fatima, who deplored the impending ruin of his house. "Our
trust," said Hosein, "is in God alone. All things, both in heaven and
earth, must perish and return to their Creator. My brother, my father,
my mother, were better than me, and every Mussulman has an example in
the prophet." He pressed his friends to consult their safety by a timely
flight: they unanimously refused to desert or survive their beloved
master: and their courage was fortified by a fervent prayer and the
assurance of paradise. On the morning of the fatal day, he mounted on
horseback, with his sword in one hand and the Koran in the other: his
generous band of martyrs consisted only of thirty-two horse and forty
foot; but their flanks and rear were secured by the tent-ropes, and by a
deep trench which they had filled with lighted fagots, according to the
practice of the Arabs. The enemy advanced with reluctance, and one of
their chiefs deserted, with thirty followers, to claim the partnership
of inevitable death. In every close onset, or single combat, the despair
of the Fatimites was invincible; but the surrounding multitudes galled
them from a distance with a cloud of arrows, and the horses and men were
successively slain; a truce was allowed on both sides for the hour
of prayer; and the battle at length expired by the death of the last
companions of Hosein. Alone, weary, and wounded, he seated himself at
the door of his tent. As he tasted a drop of water, he was pierced in
the mouth with a dart; and his son and nephew, two beautiful youths,
were killed in his arms. He lifted his hands to heaven; they were full
of blood; and he uttered a funeral prayer for the living and the dead.
In a transport of despair his sister issued from the tent, and adjured
the general of the Cufians, that he would not suffer Hosein to be
murdered before his eyes: a tear trickled down his venerable beard; and
the boldest of his soldiers fell back on every side as the dying hero
threw himself among them. The remorseless Shamer, a name detested by the
faithful, reproached their cowardice; and the grandson of Mahomet was
slain with three-and-thirty strokes of lances and swords. After they had
trampled on his body, they carried his head to the castle of Cufa, and
the inhuman Obeidollah struck him on the mouth with a cane: "Alas,"
exclaimed an aged Mussulman, "on these lips have I seen the lips of the
apostle of God!" In a distant age and climate, the tragic scene of the
death of Hosein will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader. <a href="#note-179" name="noteref-179"><small>179</small></a>

[ The account of Hosein's death, in the Persian Tarikh
Tebry, is much longer; in some circumstances, more pathetic, than that
of Ockley, followed by Gibbon. His family, after his defenders were all
slain, perished in succession before his eyes. They had been cut off
from the water, and suffered all the agonies of thirst. His eldest son,
Ally Akbar, after ten different assaults on the enemy, in each of which
he slew two or three, complained bitterly of his sufferings from heat
and thirst. "His father arose, and introducing his own tongue within
the parched lips of his favorite child, thus endeavored to alleviate his
sufferings by the only means of which his enemies had not yet been able
to deprive him." Ally was slain and cut to pieces in his sight: this
wrung from him his first and only cry; then it was that his sister
Zeyneb rushed from the tent. The rest, including his nephew, fell in
succession. Hosein's horse was wounded&mdash;he fell to the ground. The hour
of prayer, between noon and sunset, had arrived; the Imaun began the
religious duties:&mdash;as Hosein prayed, he heard the cries of his infant
child Abdallah, only twelve months old. The child was, at his desire,
placed on his bosom: as he wept over it, it was transfixed by an arrow.
Hosein dragged himself to the Euphrates: as he slaked his burning
thirst, his mouth was pierced by an arrow: he drank his own blood.
Wounded in four-and-thirty places, he still gallantly resisted. A
soldier named Zeraiah gave the fatal wound: his head was cut off by
Ziliousheng. Price, p. 402, 410.&mdash;M.]

of the Turks, who tolerate and tax the devotion of the Persian heretics.

Chardin, a traveller whom I have often praised.]

<p>
When the sisters and children of Ali were brought in chains to the
throne of Damascus, the caliph was advised to extirpate the enmity of
a popular and hostile race, whom he had injured beyond the hope of
reconciliation. But Yezid preferred the councils of mercy; and the
mourning family was honorably dismissed to mingle their tears with
their kindred at Medina. The glory of martyrdom superseded the right of
primogeniture; and the twelve imams, <a href="#note-181" name="noteref-181"><small>181</small></a> or pontiffs, of the Persian
creed, are Ali, Hassan, Hosein, and the lineal descendants of Hosein
to the ninth generation. Without arms, or treasures, or subjects, they
successively enjoyed the veneration of the people, and provoked the
jealousy of the reigning caliphs: their tombs, at Mecca or Medina, on
the banks of the Euphrates, or in the province of Chorasan, are still
visited by the devotion of their sect. Their names were often the
pretence of sedition and civil war; but these royal saints despised the
pomp of the world: submitted to the will of God and the injustice of
man; and devoted their innocent lives to the study and practice of
religion. The twelfth and last of the Imams, conspicuous by the title
of Mahadi, or the Guide, surpassed the solitude and sanctity of his
predecessors. He concealed himself in a cavern near Bagdad: the time and
place of his death are unknown; and his votaries pretend that he still
lives, and will appear before the day of judgment to overthrow the
tyranny of Dejal, or the Antichrist. <a href="#note-182" name="noteref-182"><small>182</small></a> In the lapse of two or three
centuries, the posterity of Abbas, the uncle of Mahomet, had multiplied
to the number of thirty-three thousand: <a href="#note-183" name="noteref-183"><small>183</small></a> the race of Ali might
be equally prolific: the meanest individual was above the first and
greatest of princes; and the most eminent were supposed to excel the
perfection of angels. But their adverse fortune, and the wide extent of
the Mussulman empire, allowed an ample scope for every bold and artful
imposture, who claimed affinity with the holy seed: the sceptre of the
Almohades, in Spain and Africa; of the Fatimites, in Egypt and Syria;
<a href="#note-184" name="noteref-184"><small>184</small></a> of the Sultans of Yemen; and of the Sophis of Persia; <a href="#note-185" name="noteref-185"><small>185</small></a> has
been consecrated by this vague and ambiguous title. Under their reigns
it might be dangerous to dispute the legitimacy of their birth; and one
of the Fatimite caliphs silenced an indiscreet question by drawing
his cimeter: "This," said Moez, "is my pedigree; and these," casting
a handful of gold to his soldiers,&mdash;"and these are my kindred and my
children." In the various conditions of princes, or doctors, or
nobles, or merchants, or beggars, a swarm of the genuine or fictitious
descendants of Mahomet and Ali is honored with the appellation
of sheiks, or sherifs, or emirs. In the Ottoman empire they are
distinguished by a green turban; receive a stipend from the treasury;
are judged only by their chief; and, however debased by fortune or
character, still assert the proud preeminence of their birth. A family
of three hundred persons, the pure and orthodox branch of the caliph
Hassan, is preserved without taint or suspicion in the holy cities of
Mecca and Medina, and still retains, after the revolutions of twelve
centuries, the custody of the temple, and the sovereignty of their
native land. The fame and merit of Mahomet would ennoble a plebeian
race, and the ancient blood of the Koreish transcends the recent majesty
of the kings of the earth. <a href="#note-186" name="noteref-186"><small>186</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The talents of Mahomet are entitled to our applause; but his success
has, perhaps, too strongly attracted our admiration. Are we surprised
that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the doctrine and the
passions of an eloquent fanatic? In the heresies of the church, the same
seduction has been tried and repeated from the time of the apostles to
that of the reformers. Does it seem incredible that a private citizen
should grasp the sword and the sceptre, subdue his native country, and
erect a monarchy by his victorious arms? In the moving picture of the
dynasties of the East, a hundred fortunate usurpers have arisen from a
baser origin, surmounted more formidable obstacles, and filled a larger
scope of empire and conquest. Mahomet was alike instructed to preach and
to fight; and the union of these opposite qualities, while it enhanced
his merit, contributed to his success: the operation of force and
persuasion, of enthusiasm and fear, continually acted on each other,
till every barrier yielded to their irresistible power. His voice
invited the Arabs to freedom and victory, to arms and rapine, to the
indulgence of their darling passions in this world and the other: the
restraints which he imposed were requisite to establish the credit of
the prophet, and to exercise the obedience of the people; and the
only objection to his success was his rational creed of the unity and
perfections of God. It is not the propagation, but the permanency,
of his religion, that deserves our wonder: the same pure and perfect
impression which he engraved at Mecca and Medina, is preserved, after
the revolutions of twelve centuries, by the Indian, the African, and the
Turkish proselytes of the Koran. If the Christian apostles, St. Peter or
St. Paul, could return to the Vatican, they might possibly inquire the
name of the Deity who is worshipped with such mysterious rites in that
magnificent temple: at Oxford or Geneva, they would experience less
surprise; but it might still be incumbent on them to peruse the
catechism of the church, and to study the orthodox commentators on their
own writings and the words of their Master. But the Turkish dome of St.
Sophia, with an increase of splendor and size, represents the humble
tabernacle erected at Medina by the hands of Mahomet. The Mahometans
have uniformly withstood the temptation of reducing the object of their
faith and devotion to a level with the senses and imagination of man. "I
believe in one God, and Mahomet the apostle of God," is the simple and
invariable profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the Deity has
never been degraded by any visible idol; the honors of the prophet have
never transgressed the measure of human virtue; and his living precepts
have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of
reason and religion. The votaries of Ali have, indeed, consecrated
the memory of their hero, his wife, and his children; and some of the
Persian doctors pretend that the divine essence was incarnate in the
person of the Imams; but their superstition is universally condemned
by the Sonnites; and their impiety has afforded a seasonable warning
against the worship of saints and martyrs. The metaphysical questions on
the attributes of God, and the liberty of man, have been agitated in the
schools of the Mahometans, as well as in those of the Christians; but
among the former they have never engaged the passions of the people,
or disturbed the tranquillity of the state. The cause of this important
difference may be found in the separation or union of the regal
and sacerdotal characters. It was the interest of the caliphs, the
successors of the prophet and commanders of the faithful, to repress
and discourage all religious innovations: the order, the discipline,
the temporal and spiritual ambition of the clergy, are unknown to the
Moslems; and the sages of the law are the guides of their conscience and
the oracles of their faith. From the Atlantic to the Ganges, the Koran
is acknowledged as the fundamental code, not only of theology, but
of civil and criminal jurisprudence; and the laws which regulate the
actions and the property of mankind are guarded by the infallible and
immutable sanction of the will of God. This religious servitude is
attended with some practical disadvantage; the illiterate legislator had
been often misled by his own prejudices and those of his country; and
the institutions of the Arabian desert may be ill adapted to the wealth
and numbers of Ispahan and Constantinople. On these occasions, the
Cadhi respectfully places on his head the holy volume, and substitutes a
dexterous interpretation more apposite to the principles of equity, and
the manners and policy of the times.
</p>
<p>
His beneficial or pernicious influence on the public happiness is the
last consideration in the character of Mahomet. The most bitter or
most bigoted of his Christian or Jewish foes will surely allow that
he assumed a false commission to inculcate a salutary doctrine, less
perfect only than their own. He piously supposed, as the basis of his
religion, the truth and sanctity of their prior revolutions, the virtues
and miracles of their founders. The idols of Arabia were broken before
the throne of God; the blood of human victims was expiated by prayer,
and fasting, and alms, the laudable or innocent arts of devotion; and
his rewards and punishments of a future life were painted by the images
most congenial to an ignorant and carnal generation. Mahomet was,
perhaps, incapable of dictating a moral and political system for the
use of his countrymen: but he breathed among the faithful a spirit of
charity and friendship; recommended the practice of the social virtues;
and checked, by his laws and precepts, the thirst of revenge, and the
oppression of widows and orphans. The hostile tribes were united in
faith and obedience, and the valor which had been idly spent in domestic
quarrels was vigorously directed against a foreign enemy. Had the
impulse been less powerful, Arabia, free at home and formidable abroad,
might have flourished under a succession of her native monarchs.
Her sovereignty was lost by the extent and rapidity of conquest. The
colonies of the nation were scattered over the East and West, and their
blood was mingled with the blood of their converts and captives. After
the reign of three caliphs, the throne was transported from Medina to
the valley of Damascus and the banks of the Tigris; the holy cities
were violated by impious war; Arabia was ruled by the rod of a subject,
perhaps of a stranger; and the Bedoweens of the desert, awakening from
their dream of dominion, resumed their old and solitary independence.

and sometimes correcting, the Arabic text; yet, notwithstanding their
high-sounding boasts, I cannot find, after the conclusion of my work,
that they have afforded me much (if any) additional information. The
dull mass is not quickened by a spark of philosophy or taste; and
the compilers indulge the criticism of acrimonious bigotry against
Boulainvilliers, Sale, Gagnier, and all who have treated Mahomet with
favor, or even justice.]
