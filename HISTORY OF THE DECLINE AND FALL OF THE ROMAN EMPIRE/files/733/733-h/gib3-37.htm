<p>
The indissoluble connection of civil and ecclesiastical affairs has
compelled, and encouraged, me to relate the progress, the persecutions,
the establishment, the divisions, the final triumph, and the gradual
corruption, of Christianity. I have purposely delayed the consideration
of two religious events, interesting in the study of human nature,
and important in the decline and fall of the Roman empire. I. The
institution of the monastic life; <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> and, II. The conversion of the
northern Barbarians.
</p>
<a name="note-1"><!--Note--></a>

[ The origin of the monastic institution has been laboriously
discussed by Thomassin (Discipline de l'Eglise, tom. i. p. 1119-1426)
and Helyot, (Hist. des Ordres Monastiques, tom. i. p. 1-66.) These
authors are very learned, and tolerably honest, and their difference
of opinion shows the subject in its full extent. Yet the cautious
Protestant, who distrusts any popish guides, may consult the seventh
book of Bingham's Christian Antiquities.]
</p>
<p>
I. Prosperity and peace introduced the distinction of the vulgar and
the Ascetic Christians. <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> The loose and imperfect practice of religion
satisfied the conscience of the multitude. The prince or magistrate, the
soldier or merchant, reconciled their fervent zeal, and implicit faith,
with the exercise of their profession, the pursuit of their interest,
and the indulgence of their passions: but the Ascetics, who obeyed and
abused the rigid precepts of the gospel, were inspired by the savage
enthusiasm which represents man as a criminal, and God as a tyrant. They
seriously renounced the business, and the pleasures, of the age; abjured
the use of wine, of flesh, and of marriage; chastised their body,
mortified their affections, and embraced a life of misery, as the price
of eternal happiness. In the reign of Constantine, the Ascetics fled
from a profane and degenerate world, to perpetual solitude, or religious
society. Like the first Christians of Jerusalem, <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> <a href="#note-311" name="noteref-311"><small>311</small></a> they resigned
the use, or the property of their temporal possessions; established
regular communities of the same sex, and a similar disposition; and
assumed the names of Hermits, Monks, and Anachorets, expressive of their
lonely retreat in a natural or artificial desert. They soon acquired the
respect of the world, which they despised; and the loudest applause was
bestowed on this Divine Philosophy, <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> which surpassed, without the aid
of science or reason, the laborious virtues of the Grecian schools. The
monks might indeed contend with the Stoics, in the contempt of fortune,
of pain, and of death: the Pythagorean silence and submission were
revived in their servile discipline; and they disdained, as firmly as
the Cynics themselves, all the forms and decencies of civil society. But
the votaries of this Divine Philosophy aspired to imitate a purer and
more perfect model. They trod in the footsteps of the prophets, who
had retired to the desert; <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> and they restored the devout and
contemplative life, which had been instituted by the Essenians, in
Palestine and Egypt. The philosophic eye of Pliny had surveyed with
astonishment a solitary people, who dwelt among the palm-trees near
the Dead Sea; who subsisted without money, who were propagated without
women; and who derived from the disgust and repentance of mankind a
perpetual supply of voluntary associates. <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a>

inquisition of Spain, silenced the profane criticism of the Jesuits of
Flanders, (Helyot, Hist. des Ordres Monastiques, tom. i. p. 282-300,)
and the statue of Elijah, the Carmelite, has been erected in the church
of St. Peter, (Voyages du P. Labat tom. iii. p. 87.)]

<p>
Egypt, the fruitful parent of superstition, afforded the first example
of the monastic life. Antony, <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> an illiterate <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> youth of the lower
parts of Thebais, distributed his patrimony, <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> deserted his family
and native home, and executed his monastic penance with original and
intrepid fanaticism. After a long and painful novitiate, among the
tombs, and in a ruined tower, he boldly advanced into the desert three
days' journey to the eastward of the Nile; discovered a lonely spot,
which possessed the advantages of shade and water, and fixed his last
residence on Mount Colzim, near the Red Sea; where an ancient monastery
still preserves the name and memory of the saint. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> The curious
devotion of the Christians pursued him to the desert; and when he was
obliged to appear at Alexandria, in the face of mankind, he supported
his fame with discretion and dignity. He enjoyed the friendship of
Athanasius, whose doctrine he approved; and the Egyptian peasant
respectfully declined a respectful invitation from the emperor
Constantine. The venerable patriarch (for Antony attained the age of
one hundred and five years) beheld the numerous progeny which had been
formed by his example and his lessons. The prolific colonies of monks
multiplied with rapid increase on the sands of Libya, upon the rocks of
Thebais, and in the cities of the Nile. To the south of Alexandria, the
mountain, and adjacent desert, of Nitria, were peopled by five thousand
anachorets; and the traveller may still investigate the ruins of fifty
monasteries, which were planted in that barren soil by the disciples of
Antony. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> In the Upper Thebais, the vacant island of Tabenne, <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a>
was occupied by Pachomius and fourteen hundred of his brethren. That
holy abbot successively founded nine monasteries of men, and one of
women; and the festival of Easter sometimes collected fifty thousand
religious persons, who followed his angelic rule of discipline. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a>
The stately and populous city of Oxyrinchus, the seat of Christian
orthodoxy, had devoted the temples, the public edifices, and even the
ramparts, to pious and charitable uses; and the bishop, who might preach
in twelve churches, computed ten thousand females and twenty thousand
males, of the monastic profession. <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> The Egyptians, who gloried in
this marvellous revolution, were disposed to hope, and to believe, that
the number of the monks was equal to the remainder of the people; <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a>
and posterity might repeat the saying, which had formerly been applied
to the sacred animals of the same country, That in Egypt it was less
difficult to find a god than a man.

shows, by some probable arguments, that Antony could read and write in
the Coptic, his native tongue; and that he was only a stranger to the
Greek letters. The philosopher Synesius (p. 51) acknowledges that the
natural genius of Antony did not require the aid of learning.]

<p>
Athanasius introduced into Rome the knowledge and practice of the
monastic life; and a school of this new philosophy was opened by the
disciples of Antony, who accompanied their primate to the holy threshold
of the Vatican. The strange and savage appearance of these Egyptians
excited, at first, horror and contempt, and, at length, applause and
zealous imitation. The senators, and more especially the matrons,
transformed their palaces and villas into religious houses; and
the narrow institution of six vestals was eclipsed by the frequent
monasteries, which were seated on the ruins of ancient temples, and in
the midst of the Roman forum. <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> Inflamed by the example of Antony, a
Syrian youth, whose name was Hilarion, <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> fixed his dreary abode on a
sandy beach, between the sea and a morass, about seven miles from Gaza.
The austere penance, in which he persisted forty-eight years, diffused
a similar enthusiasm; and the holy man was followed by a train of two
or three thousand anachorets, whenever he visited the innumerable
monasteries of Palestine. The fame of Basil <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> is immortal in the
monastic history of the East. With a mind that had tasted the learning
and eloquence of Athens; with an ambition scarcely to be satisfied with
the archbishopric of Caesarea, Basil retired to a savage solitude in
Pontus; and deigned, for a while, to give laws to the spiritual colonies
which he profusely scattered along the coast of the Black Sea. In the
West, Martin of Tours, <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> a soldier, a hermit, a bishop, and a saint,
established the monasteries of Gaul; two thousand of his disciples
followed him to the grave; and his eloquent historian challenges the
deserts of Thebais to produce, in a more favorable climate, a champion
of equal virtue. The progress of the monks was not less rapid, or
universal, than that of Christianity itself. Every province, and,
at last, every city, of the empire, was filled with their increasing
multitudes; and the bleak and barren isles, from Lerins to Lipari, that
arose out of the Tuscan Sea, were chosen by the anachorets for the place
of their voluntary exile. An easy and perpetual intercourse by sea
and land connected the provinces of the Roman world; and the life
of Hilarion displays the facility with which an indigent hermit of
Palestine might traverse Egypt, embark for Sicily, escape to Epirus,
and finally settle in the Island of Cyprus. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> The Latin Christians
embraced the religious institutions of Rome. The pilgrims, who visited
Jerusalem, eagerly copied, in the most distant climates of the earth,
the faithful model of the monastic life. The disciples of Antony spread
themselves beyond the tropic, over the Christian empire of Aethiopia.
<a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> The monastery of Banchor, <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> in Flintshire, which contained above
two thousand brethren, dispersed a numerous colony among the Barbarians
of Ireland; <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> and Iona, one of the Hebrides, which was planted by
the Irish monks, diffused over the northern regions a doubtful ray of
science and superstition. <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a>

<p>
These unhappy exiles from social life were impelled by the dark and
implacable genius of superstition. Their mutual resolution was supported
by the example of millions, of either sex, of every age, and of every
rank; and each proselyte who entered the gates of a monastery, was
persuaded that he trod the steep and thorny path of eternal happiness.
<a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> But the operation of these religious motives was variously
determined by the temper and situation of mankind. Reason might subdue,
or passion might suspend, their influence: but they acted most forcibly
on the infirm minds of children and females; they were strengthened by
secret remorse, or accidental misfortune; and they might derive some aid
from the temporal considerations of vanity or interest. It was naturally
supposed, that the pious and humble monks, who had renounced the world
to accomplish the work of their salvation, were the best qualified for
the spiritual government of the Christians. The reluctant hermit was
torn from his cell, and seated, amidst the acclamations of the people,
on the episcopal throne: the monasteries of Egypt, of Gaul, and of the
East, supplied a regular succession of saints and bishops; and ambition
soon discovered the secret road which led to the possession of wealth
and honors. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> The popular monks, whose reputation was connected with
the fame and success of the order, assiduously labored to multiply the
number of their fellow-captives. They insinuated themselves into noble
and opulent families; and the specious arts of flattery and seduction
were employed to secure those proselytes who might bestow wealth or
dignity on the monastic profession. The indignant father bewailed the
loss, perhaps, of an only son; <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> the credulous maid was betrayed
by vanity to violate the laws of nature; and the matron aspired to
imaginary perfection, by renouncing the virtues of domestic life. Paula
yielded to the persuasive eloquence of Jerom; <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> and the profane
title of mother-in-law of God <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> tempted that illustrious widow to
consecrate the virginity of her daughter Eustochium. By the advice, and
in the company, of her spiritual guide, Paula abandoned Rome and her
infant son; retired to the holy village of Bethlem; founded a hospital
and four monasteries; and acquired, by her alms and penance, an
eminent and conspicuous station in the Catholic church. Such rare and
illustrious penitents were celebrated as the glory and example of their
age; but the monasteries were filled by a crowd of obscure and abject
plebeians, <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> who gained in the cloister much more than they had
sacrificed in the world. Peasants, slaves, and mechanics, might escape
from poverty and contempt to a safe and honorable profession; whose
apparent hardships are mitigated by custom, by popular applause, and by
the secret relaxation of discipline. <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> The subjects of Rome, whose
persons and fortunes were made responsible for unequal and exorbitant
tributes, retired from the oppression of the Imperial government; and
the pusillanimous youth preferred the penance of a monastic, to the
dangers of a military, life. The affrighted provincials of every rank,
who fled before the Barbarians, found shelter and subsistence: whole
legions were buried in these religious sanctuaries; and the same cause,
which relieved the distress of individuals, impaired the strength and
fortitude of the empire. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a>

<p>
The monastic profession of the ancients <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> was an act of voluntary
devotion. The inconstant fanatic was threatened with the eternal
vengeance of the God whom he deserted; but the doors of the monastery
were still open for repentance. Those monks, whose conscience was
fortified by reason or passion, were at liberty to resume the character
of men and citizens; and even the spouses of Christ might accept the
legal embraces of an earthly lover. <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> The examples of scandal, and
the progress of superstition, suggested the propriety of more forcible
restraints. After a sufficient trial, the fidelity of the novice was
secured by a solemn and perpetual vow; and his irrevocable engagement
was ratified by the laws of the church and state. A guilty fugitive
was pursued, arrested, and restored to his perpetual prison; and the
interposition of the magistrate oppressed the freedom and the merit,
which had alleviated, in some degree, the abject slavery of the
monastic discipline. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> The actions of a monk, his words, and even his
thoughts, were determined by an inflexible rule, <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> or a capricious
superior: the slightest offences were corrected by disgrace or
confinement, extraordinary fasts, or bloody flagellation; and
disobedience, murmur, or delay, were ranked in the catalogue of the
most heinous sins. <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> A blind submission to the commands of the
abbot, however absurd, or even criminal, they might seem, was the ruling
principle, the first virtue of the Egyptian monks; and their patience
was frequently exercised by the most extravagant trials. They were
directed to remove an enormous rock; assiduously to water a barren
staff, that was planted in the ground, till, at the end of three
years, it should vegetate and blossom like a tree; to walk into a fiery
furnace; or to cast their infant into a deep pond: and several
saints, or madmen, have been immortalized in monastic story, by their
thoughtless and fearless obedience. <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> The freedom of the mind, the
source of every generous and rational sentiment, was destroyed by the
habits of credulity and submission; and the monk, contracting the
vices of a slave, devoutly followed the faith and passions of his
ecclesiastical tyrant. The peace of the Eastern church was invaded by
a swarm of fanatics, incapable of fear, or reason, or humanity; and the
Imperial troops acknowledged, without shame, that they were much less
apprehensive of an encounter with the fiercest Barbarians. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a>

Superstition has often
framed and consecrated the fantastic garments of the monks: <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a>
but their apparent singularity sometimes proceeds from their uniform
attachment to a simple and primitive model, which the revolutions of
fashion have made ridiculous in the eyes of mankind. The father of
the Benedictines expressly disclaims all idea of choice of merit; and
soberly exhorts his disciples to adopt the coarse and convenient dress
of the countries which they may inhabit. <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> The monastic habits of
the ancients varied with the climate, and their mode of life; and they
assumed, with the same indifference, the sheep-skin of the Egyptian
peasants, or the cloak of the Grecian philosophers. They allowed
themselves the use of linen in Egypt, where it was a cheap and domestic
manufacture; but in the West they rejected such an expensive article of
foreign luxury. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> It was the practice of the monks either to cut or
shave their hair; they wrapped their heads in a cowl to escape the
sight of profane objects; their legs and feet were naked, except in the
extreme cold of winter; and their slow and feeble steps were supported
by a long staff. The aspect of a genuine anachoret was horrid and
disgusting: every sensation that is offensive to man was thought
acceptable to God; and the angelic rule of Tabenne condemned the
salutary custom of bathing the limbs in water, and of anointing them
with oil. <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> <a href="#note-431" name="noteref-431"><small>431</small></a> The austere monks slept on the ground, on a hard
mat, or a rough blanket; and the same bundle of palm-leaves served them
as a seat in the lay, and a pillow in the night. Their original cells
were low, narrow huts, built of the slightest materials; which formed,
by the regular distribution of the streets, a large and populous
village, enclosing, within the common wall, a church, a hospital,
perhaps a library, some necessary offices, a garden, and a fountain or
reservoir of fresh water. Thirty or forty brethren composed a family
of separate discipline and diet; and the great monasteries of Egypt
consisted of thirty or forty families.

<p>
Pleasure and guilt are synonymous terms in the language of the monks,
and they discovered, by experience, that rigid fasts, and abstemious
diet, are the most effectual preservatives against the impure desires
of the flesh. <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> The rules of abstinence which they imposed, or
practised, were not uniform or perpetual: the cheerful festival of the
Pentecost was balanced by the extraordinary mortification of Lent; the
fervor of new monasteries was insensibly relaxed; and the voracious
appetite of the Gauls could not imitate the patient and temperate
virtue of the Egyptians. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> The disciples of Antony and Pachomius were
satisfied with their daily pittance, <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> of twelve ounces of bread, or
rather biscuit, <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> which they divided into two frugal repasts, of
the afternoon and of the evening. It was esteemed a merit, and almost a
duty, to abstain from the boiled vegetables which were provided for the
refectory; but the extraordinary bounty of the abbot sometimes indulged
them with the luxury of cheese, fruit, salad, and the small dried
fish of the Nile. <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> A more ample latitude of sea and river fish was
gradually allowed or assumed; but the use of flesh was long confined
to the sick or travellers; and when it gradually prevailed in the less
rigid monasteries of Europe, a singular distinction was introduced;
as if birds, whether wild or domestic, had been less profane than the
grosser animals of the field. Water was the pure and innocent beverage
of the primitive monks; and the founder of the Benedictines regrets the
daily portion of half a pint of wine, which had been extorted from him
by the intemperance of the age. <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> Such an allowance might be easily
supplied by the vineyards of Italy; and his victorious disciples, who
passed the Alps, the Rhine, and the Baltic, required, in the place of
wine, an adequate compensation of strong beer or cider.

brethren were supported by their manual labor; and the duty of labor was
strenuously recommended as a penance, as an exercise, and as the most
laudable means of securing their daily subsistence. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> The garden
and fields, which the industry of the monks had often rescued from the
forest or the morass, were diligently cultivated by their hands.
They performed, without reluctance, the menial offices of slaves and
domestics; and the several trades that were necessary to provide their
habits, their utensils, and their lodging, were exercised within the
precincts of the great monasteries. The monastic studies have tended,
for the most part, to darken, rather than to dispel, the cloud of
superstition. Yet the curiosity or zeal of some learned solitaries
has cultivated the ecclesiastical, and even the profane, sciences; and
posterity must gratefully acknowledge, that the monuments of Greek
and Roman literature have been preserved and multiplied by their
indefatigable pens. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> But the more humble industry of the monks,
especially in Egypt, was contented with the silent, sedentary occupation
of making wooden sandals, or of twisting the leaves of the palm-tree
into mats and baskets. The superfluous stock, which was not consumed in
domestic use, supplied, by trade, the wants of the community: the boats
of Tabenne, and the other monasteries of Thebais, descended the Nile
as far as Alexandria; and, in a Christian market, the sanctity of the
workmen might enhance the intrinsic value of the work.

The novice was tempted to bestow his fortune on the saints, in whose

seldom diminish, the estates of the popular monasteries, which spread
over the adjacent country and cities: and, in the first century of their

the benefit of the poor, the Christian monks had reduced a great part
of mankind to a state of beggary. <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> As long as they maintained their
original fervor, they approved themselves, however, the faithful and
benevolent stewards of the charity, which was entrusted to their care.
But their discipline was corrupted by prosperity: they gradually assumed
the pride of wealth, and at last indulged the luxury of expense. Their
public luxury might be excused by the magnificence of religious worship,
and the decent motive of erecting durable habitations for an immortal
society. But every age of the church has accused the licentiousness
of the degenerate monks; who no longer remembered the object of their

The lives of the primitive monks were consumed in penance and solitude;
undisturbed by the various occupations which fill the time, and exercise
the faculties, of reasonable, active, and social beings. Whenever
they were permitted to step beyond the precincts of the monastery, two
jealous companions were the mutual guards and spies of each other's
actions; and, after their return, they were condemned to forget, or,
at least, to suppress, whatever they had seen or heard in the world.
Strangers, who professed the orthodox faith, were hospitably entertained
in a separate apartment; but their dangerous conversation was restricted
to some chosen elders of approved discretion and fidelity. Except in
their presence, the monastic slave might not receive the visits of
his friends or kindred; and it was deemed highly meritorious, if he
afflicted a tender sister, or an aged parent, by the obstinate refusal
of a word or look. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> The monks themselves passed their lives, without
personal attachments, among a crowd which had been formed by accident,
and was detained, in the same prison, by force or prejudice. Recluse
fanatics have few ideas or sentiments to communicate: a special license
of the abbot regulated the time and duration of their familiar visits;
and, at their silent meals, they were enveloped in their cowls,
inaccessible, and almost invisible, to each other. <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> Study is the
resource of solitude: but education had not prepared and qualified for
any liberal studies the mechanics and peasants who filled the monastic
communities. They might work: but the vanity of spiritual perfection was
tempted to disdain the exercise of manual labor; and the industry must
be faint and languid, which is not excited by the sense of personal
interest.

According to their faith and zeal, they might employ the day, which they
passed in their cells, either in vocal or mental prayer: they assembled
in the evening, and they were awakened in the night, for the public
worship of the monastery. The precise moment was determined by the
stars, which are seldom clouded in the serene sky of Egypt; and a rustic
horn, or trumpet, the signal of devotion, twice interrupted the vast
silence of the desert. <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> Even sleep, the last refuge of the unhappy,
was rigorously measured: the vacant hours of the monk heavily rolled
along, without business or pleasure; and, before the close of each day,
he had repeatedly accused the tedious progress of the sun. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> In this
comfortless state, superstition still pursued and tormented her wretched
votaries. <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> The repose which they had sought in the cloister was
disturbed by a tardy repentance, profane doubts, and guilty desires;

they perpetually trembled on the edge of a flaming and bottomless abyss.
From the painful struggles of disease and despair, these unhappy victims
were sometimes relieved by madness or death; and, in the sixth century,
a hospital was founded at Jerusalem for a small portion of the austere
penitents, who were deprived of their senses. <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> Their visions,
before they attained this extreme and acknowledged term of frenzy, have
afforded ample materials of supernatural history. It was their firm
persuasion, that the air, which they breathed, was peopled with
invisible enemies; with innumerable demons, who watched every occasion,
and assumed every form, to terrify, and above all to tempt, their
unguarded virtue. The imagination, and even the senses, were deceived by
the illusions of distempered fanaticism; and the hermit, whose midnight
prayer was oppressed by involuntary slumber, might easily confound the

cells; and the extravagant penance of Hermits was stimulated by applause
and emulation. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> They sunk under the painful weight of crosses and
chains; and their emaciated limbs were confined by collars, bracelets,
gauntlets, and greaves of massy and rigid iron. All superfluous
encumbrance of dress they contemptuously cast away; and some savage
saints of both sexes have been admired, whose naked bodies were only
covered by their long hair. They aspired to reduce themselves to
the rude and miserable state in which the human brute is scarcely
distinguishable above his kindred animals; and the numerous sect of
Anachorets derived their name from their humble practice of grazing in
the fields of Mesopotamia with the common herd. <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> They often usurped
the den of some wild beast whom they affected to resemble; they buried
themselves in some gloomy cavern, which art or nature had scooped out

<p>
Among these heroes of the monastic life, the name and genius of Simeon
Stylites <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> have been immortalized by the singular invention of an
aerial penance. At the age of thirteen, the young Syrian deserted the
profession of a shepherd, and threw himself into an austere monastery.
After a long and painful novitiate, in which Simeon was repeatedly saved
from pious suicide, he established his residence on a mountain, about
thirty or forty miles to the east of Antioch. Within the space of a
mandra, or circle of stones, to which he had attached himself by a
ponderous chain, he ascended a column, which was successively raised
from the height of nine, to that of sixty, feet from the ground. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> In
this last and lofty station, the Syrian Anachoret resisted the heat
of thirty summers, and the cold of as many winters. Habit and exercise
instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation without fear
or giddiness, and successively to assume the different postures
of devotion. He sometimes prayed in an erect attitude, with his
outstretched arms in the figure of a cross, but his most familiar
practice was that of bending his meagre skeleton from the forehead to
the feet; and a curious spectator, after numbering twelve hundred and
forty-four repetitions, at length desisted from the endless account. The
progress of an ulcer in his thigh <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> might shorten, but it could not
disturb, this celestial life; and the patient Hermit expired, without
descending from his column. A prince, who should capriciously inflict
such tortures, would be deemed a tyrant; but it would surpass the power
of a tyrant to impose a long and miserable existence on the reluctant
victims of his cruelty. This voluntary martyrdom must have gradually
destroyed the sensibility both of the mind and body; nor can it be
presumed that the fanatics, who torment themselves, are susceptible of
any lively affection for the rest of mankind. A cruel, unfeeling temper
has distinguiseed the monks of every age and country: their stern
indifference, which is seldom mollified by personal friendship, is
inflamed by religious hatred; and their merciless zeal has strenuously
administered the holy office of the Inquisition.

<p>
The monastic saints, who excite only the contempt and pity of a
philosopher, were respected, and almost adored, by the prince and
people. Successive crowds of pilgrims from Gaul and India saluted the
divine pillar of Simeon: the tribes of Saracens disputed in arms the
honor of his benediction; the queens of Arabia and Persia gratefully
confessed his supernatural virtue; and the angelic Hermit was consulted
by the younger Theodosius, in the most important concerns of the church
and state. His remains were transported from the mountain of Telenissa,
by a solemn procession of the patriarch, the master-general of the East,
six bishops, twenty-one counts or tribunes, and six thousand soldiers;
and Antioch revered his bones, as her glorious ornament and impregnable
defence. The fame of the apostles and martyrs was gradually eclipsed by
these recent and popular Anachorets; the Christian world fell prostrate
before their shrines; and the miracles ascribed to their relics
exceeded, at least in number and duration, the spiritual exploits of
their lives. But the golden legend of their lives <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> was embellished
by the artful credulity of their interested brethren; and a believing
age was easily persuaded, that the slightest caprice of an Egyptian or
a Syrian monk had been sufficient to interrupt the eternal laws of the
universe. The favorites of Heaven were accustomed to cure inveterate
diseases with a touch, a word, or a distant message; and to expel the
most obstinate demons from the souls or bodies which they possessed.
They familiarly accosted, or imperiously commanded, the lions and
serpents of the desert; infused vegetation into a sapless trunk;
suspended iron on the surface of the water; passed the Nile on the
back of a crocodile, and refreshed themselves in a fiery furnace. These
extravagant tales, which display the fiction without the genius, of
poetry, have seriously affected the reason, the faith, and the morals,
of the Christians. Their credulity debased and vitiated the faculties
of the mind: they corrupted the evidence of history; and superstition
gradually extinguished the hostile light of philosophy and science.
Every mode of religious worship which had been practised by the saints,
every mysterious doctrine which they believed, was fortified by the
sanction of divine revelation, and all the manly virtues were oppressed
by the servile and pusillanimous reign of the monks. If it be possible
to measure the interval between the philosophic writings of Cicero and
the sacred legend of Theodoret, between the character of Cato and
that of Simeon, we may appreciate the memorable revolution which was
accomplished in the Roman empire within a period of five hundred years.

II. The progress of Christianity has been
marked by two glorious and decisive victories: over the learned and
luxurious citizens of the Roman empire; and over the warlike Barbarians
of Scythia and Germany, who subverted the empire, and embraced the
religion, of the Romans. The Goths were the foremost of these savage
proselytes; and the nation was indebted for its conversion to a
countryman, or, at least, to a subject, worthy to be ranked among
the inventors of useful arts, who have deserved the remembrance and
gratitude of posterity. A great number of Roman provincials had been led
away into captivity by the Gothic bands, who ravaged Asia in the time
of Gallienus; and of these captives, many were Christians, and several
belonged to the ecclesiastical order. Those involuntary missionaries,
dispersed as slaves in the villages of Dacia, successively labored for
the salvation of their masters. The seeds which they planted, of the
evangelic doctrine, were gradually propagated; and before the end of a
century, the pious work was achieved by the labors of Ulphilas, whose
ancestors had been transported beyond the Danube from a small town of
Cappadocia.
</p>
<p>
Ulphilas, the bishop and apostle of the Goths, <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> acquired their love
and reverence by his blameless life and indefatigable zeal; and they
received, with implicit confidence, the doctrines of truth and virtue
which he preached and practised. He executed the arduous task of
translating the Scriptures into their native tongue, a dialect of the
German or Teutonic language; but he prudently suppressed the four books
of Kings, as they might tend to irritate the fierce and sanguinary
spirit of the Barbarians. The rude, imperfect idiom of soldiers and
shepherds, so ill qualified to communicate any spiritual ideas, was
improved and modulated by his genius: and Ulphilas, before he could
frame his version, was obliged to compose a new alphabet of twenty-four
letters; <a href="#note-741" name="noteref-741"><small>741</small></a> four of which he invented, to express the peculiar sounds
that were unknown to the Greek and Latin pronunciation. <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> But the
prosperous state of the Gothic church was soon afflicted by war and
intestine discord, and the chieftains were divided by religion as
well as by interest. Fritigern, the friend of the Romans, became the
proselyte of Ulphilas; while the haughty soul of Athanaric disdained the
yoke of the empire and of the gospel The faith of the new converts was
tried by the persecution which he excited. A wagon, bearing aloft the
shapeless image of Thor, perhaps, or of Woden, was conducted in solemn
procession through the streets of the camp; and the rebels, who refused
to worship the god of their fathers, were immediately burnt, with their
tents and families. The character of Ulphilas recommended him to the
esteem of the Eastern court, where he twice appeared as the minister of
peace; he pleaded the cause of the distressed Goths, who implored
the protection of Valens; and the name of Moses was applied to this
spiritual guide, who conducted his people through the deep waters of
the Danube to the Land of Promise. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a> The devout shepherds, who were
attached to his person, and tractable to his voice, acquiesced in
their settlement, at the foot of the Maesian mountains, in a country
of woodlands and pastures, which supported their flocks and herds,
and enabled them to purchase the corn and wine of the more plentiful
provinces. These harmless Barbarians multiplied in obscure peace and the
profession of Christianity. <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a>

intercourse, of war, of friendship, or of conquest. In their long and

their allies; they educated the rising generation; and the devotion

edify or disgrace the palaces of Rome and Constantinople. <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> During
the same period, Christianity was embraced by almost all the Barbarians,
who established their kingdoms on the ruins of the Western empire; the
Burgundians in Gaul, the Suevi in Spain, the Vandals in Africa, the
Ostrogoths in Pannonia, and the various bands of mercenaries, that
raised Odoacer to the throne of Italy. The Franks and the Saxons still
persevered in the errors of Paganism; but the Franks obtained the
monarchy of Gaul by their submission to the example of Clovis; and
the Saxon conquerors of Britain were reclaimed from their savage
superstition by the missionaries of Rome. These Barbarian proselytes
displayed an ardent and successful zeal in the propagation of the faith.
The Merovingian kings, and their successors, Charlemagne and the Othos,
extended, by their laws and victories, the dominion of the cross.

<h2>
    Chapter XXXVII: Conversion Of The Barbarians To Christianity.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
The different motives which influenced the reason, or the passions, of
the Barbarian converts, cannot easily be ascertained. They were often
capricious and accidental; a dream, an omen, the report of a miracle,
the example of some priest, or hero, the charms of a believing wife,
and, above all, the fortunate event of a prayer, or vow, which, in a
moment of danger, they had addressed to the God of the Christians. <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a>
The early prejudices of education were insensibly erased by the habits
of frequent and familiar society, the moral precepts of the gospel
were protected by the extravagant virtues of the monks; and a spiritual
theology was supported by the visible power of relics, and the pomp of
religious worship. But the rational and ingenious mode of persuasion,
which a Saxon bishop <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> suggested to a popular saint, might sometimes
be employed by the missionaries, who labored for the conversion of
infidels. "Admit," says the sagacious disputant, "whatever they are
pleased to assert of the fabulous, and carnal, genealogy of their gods
and goddesses, who are propagated from each other. From this principle
deduce their imperfect nature, and human infirmities, the assurance they
were born, and the probability that they will die. At what time, by
what means, from what cause, were the eldest of the gods or goddesses
produced? Do they still continue, or have they ceased, to propagate? If
they have ceased, summon your antagonists to declare the reason of this
strange alteration. If they still continue, the number of the gods must
become infinite; and shall we not risk, by the indiscreet worship of
some impotent deity, to excite the resentment of his jealous superior?
The visible heavens and earth, the whole system of the universe, which
may be conceived by the mind, is it created or eternal? If created, how,
or where, could the gods themselves exist before creation? If eternal,
how could they assume the empire of an independent and preexisting
world? Urge these arguments with temper and moderation; insinuate, at
seasonable intervals, the truth and beauty of the Christian revelation;
and endeavor to make the unbelievers ashamed, without making them
angry." This metaphysical reasoning, too refined, perhaps, for the
Barbarians of Germany, was fortified by the grosser weight of authority
and popular consent. The advantage of temporal prosperity had deserted
the Pagan cause, and passed over to the service of Christianity. The
Romans themselves, the most powerful and enlightened nation of the
globe, had renounced their ancient superstition; and, if the ruin
of their empire seemed to accuse the efficacy of the new faith, the
disgrace was already retrieved by the conversion of the victorious
Goths. The valiant and fortunate Barbarians, who subdued the provinces
of the West, successively received, and reflected, the same edifying
example. Before the age of Charlemagne, the Christian nations of Europe
might exult in the exclusive possession of the temperate climates, of
the fertile lands, which produced corn, wine, and oil; while the savage
idolaters, and their helpless idols, were confined to the extremities of
the earth, the dark and frozen regions of the North. <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a>

</p>
<p>
Christianity, which opened the gates of Heaven to the Barbarians,
introduced an important change in their moral and political condition.
They received, at the same time, the use of letters, so essential to a
religion whose doctrines are contained in a sacred book; and while they
studied the divine truth, their minds were insensibly enlarged by the
distant view of history, of nature, of the arts, and of society.
The version of the Scriptures into their native tongue, which had
facilitated their conversion, must excite among their clergy some
curiosity to read the original text, to understand the sacred liturgy of
the church, and to examine, in the writings of the fathers, the chain
of ecclesiastical tradition. These spiritual gifts were preserved in the
Greek and Latin languages, which concealed the inestimable monuments of
ancient learning. The immortal productions of Virgil, Cicero, and Livy,
which were accessible to the Christian Barbarians, maintained a silent
intercourse between the reign of Augustus and the times of Clovis and
Charlemagne. The emulation of mankind was encouraged by the remembrance
of a more perfect state; and the flame of science was secretly kept
alive, to warm and enlighten the mature age of the Western world.
</p>
<p>
In the most corrupt state of Christianity, the Barbarians might learn
justice from the law, and mercy from the gospel; and if the knowledge of
their duty was insufficient to guide their actions, or to regulate their
passions, they were sometimes restrained by conscience, and frequently
punished by remorse. But the direct authority of religion was less
effectual than the holy communion, which united them with their
Christian brethren in spiritual friendship. The influence of these
sentiments contributed to secure their fidelity in the service, or the
alliance, of the Romans, to alleviate the horrors of war, to moderate
the insolence of conquest, and to preserve, in the downfall of the
empire, a permanent respect for the name and institutions of Rome. In
the days of Paganism, the priests of Gaul and Germany reigned over the
people, and controlled the jurisdiction of the magistrates; and the
zealous proselytes transferred an equal, or more ample, measure of
devout obedience, to the pontiffs of the Christian faith. The sacred
character of the bishops was supported by their temporal possessions;
they obtained an honorable seat in the legislative assemblies of
soldiers and freemen; and it was their interest, as well as their duty,
to mollify, by peaceful counsels, the fierce spirit of the Barbarians.
The perpetual correspondence of the Latin clergy, the frequent
pilgrimages to Rome and Jerusalem, and the growing authority of the
popes, cemented the union of the Christian republic, and gradually
produced the similar manners, and common jurisprudence, which have
distinguished, from the rest of mankind, the independent, and even
hostile, nations of modern Europe.
</p>
<p>
But the operation of these causes was checked and retarded by the
unfortunate accident, which infused a deadly poison into the cup of
Salvation. Whatever might be the early sentiments of Ulphilas, his
connections with the empire and the church were formed during the reign
of Arianism. The apostle of the Goths subscribed the creed of Rimini;
professed with freedom, and perhaps with sincerity, that the Son was not
equal, or consubstantial to the Father; <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> communicated these errors
to the clergy and people; and infected the Barbaric world with a heresy,
<a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> which the great Theodosius proscribed and extinguished among the
Romans. The temper and understanding of the new proselytes were not
adapted to metaphysical subtilties; but they strenuously maintained,
what they had piously received, as the pure and genuine doctrines of
Christianity. The advantage of preaching and expounding the Scriptures
in the Teutonic language promoted the apostolic labors of Ulphilas and
his successors; and they ordained a competent number of bishops and
presbyters for the instruction of the kindred tribes. The Ostrogoths,
the Burgundians, the Suevi, and the Vandals, who had listened to the
eloquence of the Latin clergy, <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> preferred the more intelligible
lessons of their domestic teachers; and Arianism was adopted as the
national faith of the warlike converts, who were seated on the ruins
of the Western empire. This irreconcilable difference of religion was a
perpetual source of jealousy and hatred; and the reproach of Barbarian
was imbittered by the more odious epithet of Heretic. The heroes of
the North, who had submitted, with some reluctance, to believe that all
their ancestors were in hell, <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> were astonished and exasperated to
learn, that they themselves had only changed the mode of their eternal
condemnation. Instead of the smooth applause, which Christian kings are
accustomed to expect from their royal prelates, the orthodox bishops
and their clergy were in a state of opposition to the Arian courts;
and their indiscreet opposition frequently became criminal, and might
sometimes be dangerous. <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a> The pulpit, that safe and sacred organ of
sedition, resounded with the names of Pharaoh and Holofernes; <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> the
public discontent was inflamed by the hope or promise of a glorious
deliverance; and the seditious saints were tempted to promote the
accomplishment of their own predictions. Notwithstanding these
provocations, the Catholics of Gaul, Spain, and Italy, enjoyed, under
the reign of the Arians, the free and peaceful exercise of their
religion. Their haughty masters respected the zeal of a numerous people,
resolved to die at the foot of their altars; and the example of their
devout constancy was admired and imitated by the Barbarians themselves.
The conquerors evaded, however, the disgraceful reproach, or confession,
of fear, by attributing their toleration to the liberal motives
of reason and humanity; and while they affected the language, they
imperceptiby imbibed the spirit, of genuine Christianity.

which he punished such indiscreet allusions. Victor Vitensis, l. 7, p.

</p>
<p>
The peace of the church was sometimes interrupted. The Catholics were
indiscreet, the Barbarians were impatient; and the partial acts of
severity or injustice, which had been recommended by the Arian clergy,
were exaggerated by the orthodox writers. The guilt of persecution may
be imputed to Euric, king of the Visigoths; who suspended the exercise
of ecclesiastical, or, at least, of episcopal functions; and punished
the popular bishops of Aquitain with imprisonment, exile, and
confiscation. <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> But the cruel and absurd enterprise of subduing the
minds of a whole people was undertaken by the Vandals alone. Genseric
himself, in his early youth, had renounced the orthodox communion; and
the apostate could neither grant, nor expect, a sincere forgiveness. He
was exasperated to find that the Africans, who had fled before him in
the field, still presumed to dispute his will in synods and churches;
and his ferocious mind was incapable of fear or of compassion. His
Catholic subjects were oppressed by intolerant laws and arbitrary
punishments. The language of Genseric was furious and formidable;
the knowledge of his intentions might justify the most unfavorable
interpretation of his actions; and the Arians were reproached with the
frequent executions which stained the palace and the dominions of the
tyrant. Arms and ambition were, however, the ruling passions of the
monarch of the sea. But Hunneric, his inglorious son, who seemed
to inherit only his vices, tormented the Catholics with the same
unrelenting fury which had been fatal to his brother, his nephews,
and the friends and favorites of his father; and even to the Arian
patriarch, who was inhumanly burnt alive in the midst of Carthage.
The religious war was preceded and prepared by an insidious truce;
persecution was made the serious and important business of the Vandal
court; and the loathsome disease which hastened the death of Hunneric,
revenged the injuries, without contributing to the deliverance, of the
church. The throne of Africa was successively filled by the two nephews
of Hunneric; by Gundamund, who reigned about twelve, and by Thrasimund,
who governed the nation about twenty-seven, years. Their administration
was hostile and oppressive to the orthodox party. Gundamund appeared to
emulate, or even to surpass, the cruelty of his uncle; and, if at length
he relented, if he recalled the bishops, and restored the freedom of
Athanasian worship, a premature death intercepted the benefits of his
tardy clemency. His brother, Thrasimund, was the greatest and most
accomplished of the Vandal kings, whom he excelled in beauty, prudence,
and magnanimity of soul. But this magnanimous character was degraded
by his intolerant zeal and deceitful clemency. Instead of threats and
tortures, he employed the gentle, but efficacious, powers of seduction.
Wealth, dignity, and the royal favor, were the liberal rewards of
apostasy; the Catholics, who had violated the laws, might purchase
their pardon by the renunciation of their faith; and whenever
Thrasimund meditated any rigorous measure, he patiently waited till
the indiscretion of his adversaries furnished him with a specious
opportunity. Bigotry was his last sentiment in the hour of death; and he
exacted from his successor a solemn oath, that he would never tolerate
the sectaries of Athanasius. But his successor, Hilderic, the gentle son
of the savage Hunneric, preferred the duties of humanity and justice to
the vain obligation of an impious oath; and his accession was gloriously
marked by the restoration of peace and universal freedom. The throne of
that virtuous, though feeble monarch, was usurped by his cousin Gelimer,
a zealous Arian: but the Vandal kingdom, before he could enjoy or abuse
his power, was subverted by the arms of Belisarius; and the orthodox
party retaliated the injuries which they had endured. <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a>

p. 196, 197, 198, 199.) Dom Ruinart, the last editor of Victor, has
illustrated the whole subject with a copious and learned apparatus of
notes and supplement (Paris, 1694.)] 
</p>
<p>
The passionate declamations of the
Catholics, the sole historians of this persecution, cannot afford
any distinct series of causes and events; any impartial view of the
characters, or counsels; but the most remarkable circumstances that
deserve either credit or notice, may be referred to the following heads;
I. In the original law, which is still extant, <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a> Hunneric expressly
declares, (and the declaration appears to be correct,) that he had
faithfully transcribed the regulations and penalties of the Imperial
edicts, against the heretical congregations, the clergy, and the people,
who dissented from the established religion. If the rights of conscience
had been understood, the Catholics must have condemned their past
conduct or acquiesced in their actual suffering. But they still
persisted to refuse the indulgence which they claimed. While they
trembled under the lash of persecution, they praised the laudable
severity of Hunneric himself, who burnt or banished great numbers
of Manichaeans; <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> and they rejected, with horror, the ignominious
compromise, that the disciples of Arius and of Athanasius should enjoy a
reciprocal and similar toleration in the territories of the Romans, and
in those of the Vandals. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> II. The practice of a conference,
which the Catholics had so frequently used to insult and punish their
obstinate antagonists, was retorted against themselves. <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> At the
command of Hunneric, four hundred and sixty-six orthodox bishops
assembled at Carthage; but when they were admitted into the hall of
audience, they had the mortification of beholding the Arian Cyrila
exalted on the patriarchal throne. The disputants were separated, after
the mutual and ordinary reproaches of noise and silence, of delay and
precipitation, of military force and of popular clamor. One martyr and
one confessor were selected among the Catholic bishops; twenty-eight
escaped by flight, and eighty-eight by conformity; forty-six were sent
into Corsica to cut timber for the royal navy; and three hundred and two
were banished to the different parts of Africa, exposed to the insults
of their enemies, and carefully deprived of all the temporal and
spiritual comforts of life. <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> The hardships of ten years' exile must
have reduced their numbers; and if they had complied with the law of
Thrasimund, which prohibited any episcopal consecrations, the orthodox
church of Africa must have expired with the lives of its actual members.
They disobeyed, and their disobedience was punished by a second exile
of two hundred and twenty bishops into Sardinia; where they languished
fifteen years, till the accession of the gracious Hilderic. <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> The two
islands were judiciously chosen by the malice of their Arian tyrants.
Seneca, from his own experience, has deplored and exaggerated the
miserable state of Corsica, <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> and the plenty of Sardinia was
overbalanced by the unwholesome quality of the air. <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> III. The zeal
of Generic and his successors, for the conversion of the Catholics, must
have rendered them still more jealous to guard the purity of the Vandal
faith. Before the churches were finally shut, it was a crime to appear
in a Barbarian dress; and those who presumed to neglect the royal
mandate were rudely dragged backwards by their long hair. <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> The
palatine officers, who refused to profess the religion of their prince,
were ignominiously stripped of their honors and employments; banished
to Sardinia and Sicily; or condemned to the servile labors of slaves
and peasants in the fields of Utica. In the districts which had been
peculiarly allotted to the Vandals, the exercise of the Catholic worship
was more strictly prohibited; and severe penalties were denounced
against the guilt both of the missionary and the proselyte. By these
arts, the faith of the Barbarians was preserved, and their zeal was
inflamed: they discharged, with devout fury, the office of spies,
informers, or executioners; and whenever their cavalry took the field,
it was the favorite amusement of the march to defile the churches, and
to insult the clergy of the adverse faction. <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> IV. The citizens who
had been educated in the luxury of the Roman province, were delivered,
with exquisite cruelty, to the Moors of the desert. A venerable train of
bishops, presbyters, and deacons, with a faithful crowd of four thousand
and ninety-six persons, whose guilt is not precisely ascertained, were
torn from their native homes, by the command of Hunneric. During the
night they were confined, like a herd of cattle, amidst their own
ordure: during the day they pursued their march over the burning sands;
and if they fainted under the heat and fatigue, they were goaded, or
dragged along, till they expired in the hands of their tormentors. <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a>
These unhappy exiles, when they reached the Moorish huts, might excite
the compassion of a people, whose native humanity was neither improved
by reason, nor corrupted by fanaticism: but if they escaped the dangers,
they were condemned to share the distress of a savage life. V. It is
incumbent on the authors of persecution previously to reflect, whether
they are determined to support it in the last extreme. They excite the
flame which they strive to extinguish; and it soon becomes necessary to
chastise the contumacy, as well as the crime, of the offender. The fine,
which he is unable or unwilling to discharge, exposes his person to the
severity of the law; and his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the
use and propriety of capital punishment. Through the veil of fiction and
declamation we may clearly perceive, that the Catholics more especially
under the reign of Hunneric, endured the most cruel and ignominious
treatment. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> Respectable citizens, noble matrons, and consecrated
virgins, were stripped naked, and raised in the air by pulleys, with
a weight suspended at their feet. In this painful attitude their naked
bodies were torn with scourges, or burnt in the most tender parts with
red-hot plates of iron. The amputation of the ears the nose, the tongue,
and the right hand, was inflicted by the Arians; and although the
precise number cannot be defined, it is evident that many persons, among
whom a bishop <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> and a proconsul <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> may be named, were entitled to
the crown of martyrdom. The same honor has been ascribed to the memory
of Count Sebastian, who professed the Nicene creed with unshaken
constancy; and Genseric might detest, as a heretic, the brave and
ambitious fugitive whom he dreaded as a rival. <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> VI. A new mode of
conversion, which might subdue the feeble, and alarm the timorous, was
employed by the Arian ministers. They imposed, by fraud or violence, the
rites of baptism; and punished the apostasy of the Catholics, if they
disclaimed this odious and profane ceremony, which scandalously violated
the freedom of the will, and the unity of the sacrament. <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> The
hostile sects had formerly allowed the validity of each other's baptism;
and the innovation, so fiercely maintained by the Vandals, can be
imputed only to the example and advice of the Donatists. VII. The Arian
clergy surpassed in religious cruelty the king and his Vandals; but they
were incapable of cultivating the spiritual vineyard, which they were so
desirous to possess. A patriarch <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a> might seat himself on the throne
of Carthage; some bishops, in the principal cities, might usurp the
place of their rivals; but the smallness of their numbers, and their
ignorance of the Latin language, <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> disqualified the Barbarians for
the ecclesiastical ministry of a great church; and the Africans, after
the loss of their orthodox pastors, were deprived of the public exercise
of Christianity. VIII. The emperors were the natural protectors of the
Homoousian doctrine; and the faithful people of Africa, both as Romans
and as Catholics, preferred their lawful sovereignty to the usurpation
of the Barbarous heretics. During an interval of peace and friendship,
Hunneric restored the cathedral of Carthage; at the intercession of
Zeno, who reigned in the East, and of Placidia, the daughter and relict
of emperors, and the sister of the queen of the Vandals. <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> But this
decent regard was of short duration; and the haughty tyrant displayed
his contempt for the religion of the empire, by studiously arranging the
bloody images of persecution, in all the principal streets through which
the Roman ambassador must pass in his way to the palace. <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> An oath
was required from the bishops, who were assembled at Carthage, that they
would support the succession of his son Hilderic, and that they would
renounce all foreign or transmarine correspondence. This engagement,
consistent, as it should seem, with their moral and religious duties,
was refused by the more sagacious members <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a> of the assembly. Their
refusal, faintly colored by the pretence that it is unlawful for a
Christian to swear, must provoke the suspicions of a jealous tyrant.

<h2>
    Chapter XXXVII: Conversion Of The Barbarians To Christianity.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
The Catholics, oppressed by royal and military force, were far superior
to their adversaries in numbers and learning. With the same weapons
which the Greek <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> and Latin fathers had already provided for the
Arian controversy, they repeatedly silenced, or vanquished, the fierce
and illiterate successors of Ulphilas. The consciousness of their
own superiority might have raised them above the arts and passions of
religious warfare. Yet, instead of assuming such honorable pride, the
orthodox theologians were tempted, by the assurance of impunity, to
compose fictions, which must be stigmatized with the epithets of
fraud and forgery. They ascribed their own polemical works to the most
venerable names of Christian antiquity; the characters of Athanasius and
Augustin were awkwardly personated by Vigilius and his disciples; <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a>
and the famous creed, which so clearly expounds the mysteries of the
Trinity and the Incarnation, is deduced, with strong probability, from
this African school. <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> Even the Scriptures themselves were profaned
by their rash and sacrilegious hands. The memorable text, which asserts
the unity of the three who bear witness in heaven, <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> is condemned
by the universal silence of the orthodox fathers, ancient versions,
and authentic manuscripts. <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> It was first alleged by the Catholic
bishops whom Hunneric summoned to the conference of Carthage. <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> An
allegorical interpretation, in the form, perhaps, of a marginal note,
invaded the text of the Latin Bibles, which were renewed and corrected
in a dark period of ten centuries. <a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a> After the invention of
printing, <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a> the editors of the Greek Testament yielded to their own

<p>
The example of fraud must excite suspicion: and the specious miracles by
which the African Catholics have defended the truth and justice of their
cause, may be ascribed, with more reason, to their own industry, than
to the visible protection of Heaven. Yet the historian, who views this
religious conflict with an impartial eye, may condescend to mention
one preternatural event, which will edify the devout, and surprise the
incredulous. Tipasa, <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a> a maritime colony of Mauritania, sixteen
miles to the east of Caesarea, had been distinguished, in every age, by
the orthodox zeal of its inhabitants. They had braved the fury of the
Donatists; <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> they resisted, or eluded, the tyranny of the Arians.
The town was deserted on the approach of an heretical bishop: most of
the inhabitants who could procure ships passed over to the coast of
Spain; and the unhappy remnant, refusing all communion with the usurper,
still presumed to hold their pious, but illegal, assemblies. Their
disobedience exasperated the cruelty of Hunneric. A military count was
despatched from Carthage to Tipasa: he collected the Catholics in the
Forum, and, in the presence of the whole province, deprived the
guilty of their right hands and their tongues. But the holy confessors
continued to speak without tongues; and this miracle is attested by
Victor, an African bishop, who published a history of the persecution
within two years after the event. <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a> "If any one," says Victor,
"should doubt of the truth, let him repair to Constantinople, and listen
to the clear and perfect language of Restitutus, the sub-deacon, one of
these glorious sufferers, who is now lodged in the palace of the emperor
Zeno, and is respected by the devout empress." At Constantinople we
are astonished to find a cool, a learned, and unexceptionable witness,
without interest, and without passion. Aeneas of Gaza, a Platonic
philosopher, has accurately described his own observations on these
African sufferers. "I saw them myself: I heard them speak: I diligently
inquired by what means such an articulate voice could be formed without
any organ of speech: I used my eyes to examine the report of my ears;
I opened their mouth, and saw that the whole tongue had been completely
torn away by the roots; an operation which the physicians generally
suppose to be mortal." <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a> The testimony of Aeneas of Gaza might be
confirmed by the superfluous evidence of the emperor Justinian, in a
perpetual edict; of Count Marcellinus, in his Chronicle of the times;
and of Pope Gregory the First, who had resided at Constantinople, as the
minister of the Roman pontiff. <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a> They all lived within the compass
of a century; and they all appeal to their personal knowledge, or the
public notoriety, for the truth of a miracle, which was repeated in
several instances, displayed on the greatest theatre of the world, and
submitted, during a series of years, to the calm examination of the
senses. This supernatural gift of the African confessors, who spoke
without tongues, will command the assent of those, and of those only,
who already believe, that their language was pure and orthodox. But the
stubborn mind of an infidel, is guarded by secret, incurable suspicion;
and the Arian, or Socinian, who has seriously rejected the doctrine of
a Trinity, will not be shaken by the most plausible evidence of an
Athanasian miracle.

<p>
The Vandals and the Ostrogoths persevered in the profession of Arianism
till the final ruin of the kingdoms which they had founded in Africa and
Italy. The Barbarians of Gaul submitted to the orthodox dominion of the
Franks; and Spain was restored to the Catholic church by the voluntary
conversion of the Visigoths.
</p>
<p>
This salutary revolution <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> was hastened by the example of a royal
martyr, whom our calmer reason may style an ungrateful rebel. Leovigild,
the Gothic monarch of Spain, deserved the respect of his enemies, and
the love of his subjects; the Catholics enjoyed a free toleration, and
his Arian synods attempted, without much success, to reconcile their
scruples by abolishing the unpopular rite of a second baptism. His
eldest son Hermenegild, who was invested by his father with the royal
diadem, and the fair principality of Boetica, contracted an honorable
and orthodox alliance with a Merovingian princess, the daughter of
Sigebert, king of Austrasia, and of the famous Brunechild. The beauteous
Ingundis, who was no more than thirteen years of age, was received,
beloved, and persecuted, in the Arian court of Toledo; and her religious
constancy was alternately assaulted with blandishments and violence by
Goisvintha, the Gothic queen, who abused the double claim of maternal
authority. <a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a> Incensed by her resistance, Goisvintha seized the
Catholic princess by her long hair, inhumanly dashed her against the
ground, kicked her till she was covered with blood, and at last
gave orders that she should be stripped, and thrown into a basin, or
fish-pond. <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> Love and honor might excite Hermenegild to resent this
injurious treatment of his bride; and he was gradually persuaded that
Ingundis suffered for the cause of divine truth. Her tender complaints,
and the weighty arguments of Le ander, archbishop of Seville,
accomplished his conversion and the heir of the Gothic monarchy was
initiated in the Nicene faith by the solemn rites of confirmation. <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a>
The rash youth, inflamed by zeal, and perhaps by ambition, was tempted
to violate the duties of a son and a subject; and the Catholics of
Spain, although they could not complain of persecution, applauded
his pious rebellion against an heretical father. The civil war was
protracted by the long and obstinate sieges of Merida, Cordova, and
Seville, which had strenuously espoused the party of Hermenegild He
invited the orthodox Barbarians, the Seuvi, and the Franks, to the
destruction of his native land; he solicited the dangerous aid of the
Romans, who possessed Africa, and a part of the Spanish coast; and
his holy ambassador, the archbishop Leander, effectually negotiated in
person with the Byzantine court. But the hopes of the Catholics were
crushed by the active diligence of the monarch who commanded the troops
and treasures of Spain; and the guilty Hermenegild, after his vain
attempts to resist or to escape, was compelled to surrender himself into
the hands of an incensed father. Leovigild was still mindful of that
sacred character; and the rebel, despoiled of the regal ornaments, was
still permitted, in a decent exile, to profess the Catholic religion.
His repeated and unsuccessful treasons at length provoked the
indignation of the Gothic king; and the sentence of death, which he
pronounced with apparent reluctance, was privately executed in the tower
of Seville. The inflexible constancy with which he refused to accept the
Arian communion, as the price of his safety, may excuse the honors that
have been paid to the memory of St. Hermenegild. His wife and infant son
were detained by the Romans in ignominious captivity; and this domestic
misfortune tarnished the glories of Leovigild, and imbittered the last
moments of his life.

His son and successor, Recared, the
first Catholic king of Spain, had imbibed the faith of his unfortunate
brother, which he supported with more prudence and success. Instead of
revolting against his father, Recared patiently expected the hour of his
death. Instead of condemning his memory, he piously supposed, that the
dying monarch had abjured the errors of Arianism, and recommended to
his son the conversion of the Gothic nation. To accomplish that salutary
end, Recared convened an assembly of the Arian clergy and nobles,
declared himself a Catholic, and exhorted them to imitate the example
of their prince. The laborious interpretation of doubtful texts, or the
curious pursuit of metaphysical arguments, would have excited an endless
controversy; and the monarch discreetly proposed to his illiterate
audience two substantial and visible arguments,&mdash;the testimony of Earth,
and of Heaven. The Earth had submitted to the Nicene synod: the Romans,
the Barbarians, and the inhabitants of Spain, unanimously professed
the same orthodox creed; and the Visigoths resisted, almost alone, the
consent of the Christian world. A superstitious age was prepared to
reverence, as the testimony of Heaven, the preternatural cures, which
were performed by the skill or virtue of the Catholic clergy; the
baptismal fonts of Osset in Boetica, <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> which were spontaneously
replenished every year, on the vigil of Easter; <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a> and the miraculous
shrine of St. Martin of Tours, which had already converted the Suevic
prince and people of Gallicia. <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a> The Catholic king encountered
some difficulties on this important change of the national religion. A
conspiracy, secretly fomented by the queen-dowager, was formed against
his life; and two counts excited a dangerous revolt in the Narbonnese
Gaul. But Recared disarmed the conspirators, defeated the rebels, and
executed severe justice; which the Arians, in their turn, might brand
with the reproach of persecution. Eight bishops, whose names betray
their Barbaric origin, abjured their errors; and all the books of Arian
theology were reduced to ashes, with the house in which they had been
purposely collected. The whole body of the Visigoths and Suevi were
allured or driven into the pale of the Catholic communion; the faith, at
least of the rising generation, was fervent and sincere: and the devout
liberality of the Barbarians enriched the churches and monasteries of
Spain. Seventy bishops, assembled in the council of Toledo, received the
submission of their conquerors; and the zeal of the Spaniards improved
the Nicene creed, by declaring the procession of the Holy Ghost from
the Son, as well as from the Father; a weighty point of doctrine, which
produced, long afterwards, the schism of the Greek and Latin churches.
<a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> The royal proselyte immediately saluted and consulted Pope
Gregory, surnamed the Great, a learned and holy prelate, whose reign
was distinguished by the conversion of heretics and infidels. The
ambassadors of Recared respectfully offered on the threshold of
the Vatican his rich presents of gold and gems; they accepted, as a
lucrative exchange, the hairs of St. John the Baptist; a cross, which
enclosed a small piece of the true wood; and a key, that contained some
particles of iron which had been scraped from the chains of St. Peter.

The same Gregory, the spiritual conqueror of Britain, encouraged the
pious Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards, to propagate the Nicene faith
among the victorious savages, whose recent Christianity was polluted by
the Arian heresy. Her devout labors still left room for the industry
and success of future missionaries; and many cities of Italy were still
disputed by hostile bishops. But the cause of Arianism was gradually
suppressed by the weight of truth, of interest, and of example; and
the controversy, which Egypt had derived from the Platonic school, was
terminated, after a war of three hundred years, by the final conversion
of the Lombards of Italy. <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a>

before the end of the seventh century.]

The first missionaries who preached the gospel to the Barbarians,
appealed to the evidence of reason, and claimed the benefit of
toleration. <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a> But no sooner had they established their spiritual
dominion, than they exhorted the Christian kings to extirpate, without
mercy, the remains of Roman or Barbaric superstition. The successors
of Clovis inflicted one hundred lashes on the peasants who refused to
destroy their idols; the crime of sacrificing to the demons was punished
by the Anglo-Saxon laws with the heavier penalties of imprisonment and
confiscation; and even the wise Alfred adopted, as an indispensable
duty, the extreme rigor of the Mosaic institutions. <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a> But the
punishment and the crime were gradually abolished among a Christian
people; the theological disputes of the schools were suspended by
propitious ignorance; and the intolerant spirit which could find neither
idolaters nor heretics, was reduced to the persecution of the Jews. That
exiled nation had founded some synagogues in the cities of Gaul;
but Spain, since the time of Hadrian, was filled with their numerous
colonies. <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a> The wealth which they accumulated by trade, and the
management of the finances, invited the pious avarice of their masters;
and they might be oppressed without danger, as they had lost the use,
and even the remembrance, of arms. Sisebut, a Gothic king, who reigned
in the beginning of the seventh century, proceeded at once to the last
extremes of persecution. <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a> Ninety thousand Jews were compelled to
receive the sacrament of baptism; the fortunes of the obstinate infidels
were confiscated, their bodies were tortured; and it seems doubtful
whether they were permitted to abandon their native country. The
excessive zeal of the Catholic king was moderated, even by the clergy
of Spain, who solemnly pronounced an inconsistent sentence: that the
sacraments should not be forcibly imposed; but that the Jews who had
been baptized should be constrained, for the honor of the church, to
persevere in the external practice of a religion which they disbelieved
and detested. Their frequent relapses provoked one of the successors of
Sisebut to banish the whole nation from his dominions; and a council
of Toledo published a decree, that every Gothic king should swear to
maintain this salutary edict. But the tyrants were unwilling to dismiss
the victims, whom they delighted to torture, or to deprive themselves
of the industrious slaves, over whom they might exercise a lucrative
oppression. The Jews still continued in Spain, under the weight of
the civil and ecclesiastical laws, which in the same country have been
faithfully transcribed in the Code of the Inquisition. The Gothic kings
and bishops at length discovered, that injuries will produce hatred, and
that hatred will find the opportunity of revenge. A nation, the secret
or professed enemies of Christianity, still multiplied in servitude and
distress; and the intrigues of the Jews promoted the rapid success of
the Arabian conquerors. <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a>

As soon as the Barbarians withdrew their powerful support, the unpopular
heresy of Arius sunk into contempt and oblivion. But the Greeks still
retained their subtle and loquacious disposition: the establishment of
an obscure doctrine suggested new questions, and new disputes; and it
was always in the power of an ambitious prelate, or a fanatic monk,
to violate the peace of the church, and, perhaps, of the empire. The
historian of the empire may overlook those disputes which were confined
to the obscurity of schools and synods. The Manichaeans, who labored
to reconcile the religions of Christ and of Zoroaster, had secretly
introduced themselves into the provinces: but these foreign sectaries
were involved in the common disgrace of the Gnostics, and the Imperial
laws were executed by the public hatred. The rational opinions of the
Pelagians were propagated from Britain to Rome, Africa, and Palestine,
and silently expired in a superstitious age. But the East was distracted
by the Nestorian and Eutychian controversies; which attempted to explain
the mystery of the incarnation, and hastened the ruin of Christianity in
her native land. These controversies were first agitated under the reign
of the younger Theodosius: but their important consequences extend
far beyond the limits of the present volume. The metaphysical chain of
argument, the contests of ecclesiastical ambition, and their political
influence on the decline of the Byzantine empire, may afford an
interesting and instructive series of history, from the general councils
of Ephesus and Chalcedon, to the conquest of the East by the successors
of Mahomet.
