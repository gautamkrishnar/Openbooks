<p>
The Western world was oppressed by the Goths and Vandals, who fled
before the Huns; but the achievements of the Huns themselves were not
adequate to their power and prosperity. Their victorious hordes had
spread from the Volga to the Danube; but the public force was exhausted
by the discord of independent chieftains; their valor was idly consumed
in obscure and predatory excursions; and they often degraded their
national dignity, by condescending, for the hopes of spoil, to enlist
under the banners of their fugitive enemies. In the reign of Attila, <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a>
the Huns again became the terror of the world; and I shall now describe
the character and actions of that formidable Barbarian; who alternately
insulted and invaded the East and the West, and urged the rapid downfall
of the Roman empire.

[ The authentic materials for the history of Attila, may be
found in Jornandes (de Rebus Geticis, c. 34-50, p. 668-688, edit. Grot.)
and Priscus (Excerpta de Legationibus, p. 33-76, Paris, 1648.) I have
not seen the Lives of Attila, composed by Juvencus Caelius Calanus
Dalmatinus, in the twelfth century, or by Nicholas Olahus, archbishop
of Gran, in the sixteenth. See Mascou's History of the Germans, ix., and
Maffei Osservazioni Litterarie, tom. i. p. 88, 89. Whatever the modern
Hungarians have added must be fabulous; and they do not seem to have
excelled in the art of fiction. They suppose, that when Attila invaded
Gaul and Italy, married innumerable wives, &amp;c., he was one hundred and
twenty years of age. Thewrocz Chron. c. i. p. 22, in Script. Hunger.
tom. i. p. 76.]
</p>
<p>
In the tide of emigration which impetuously rolled from the confines
of China to those of Germany, the most powerful and populous tribes may
commonly be found on the verge of the Roman provinces. The accumulated
weight was sustained for a while by artificial barriers; and the easy
condescension of the emperors invited, without satisfying, the insolent
demands of the Barbarians, who had acquired an eager appetite for the
luxuries of civilized life. The Hungarians, who ambitiously insert the
name of Attila among their native kings, may affirm with truth that the
hordes, which were subject to his uncle Roas, or Rugilas, had formed
their encampments within the limits of modern Hungary, <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> in a fertile
country, which liberally supplied the wants of a nation of hunters and
shepherds. In this advantageous situation, Rugilas, and his valiant
brothers, who continually added to their power and reputation, commanded
the alternative of peace or war with the two empires. His alliance with
the Romans of the West was cemented by his personal friendship for the
great Aetius; who was always secure of finding, in the Barbarian camp, a
hospitable reception and a powerful support. At his solicitation, and
in the name of John the usurper, sixty thousand Huns advanced to the
confines of Italy; their march and their retreat were alike expensive to
the state; and the grateful policy of Aetius abandoned the possession of
Pannonia to his faithful confederates. The Romans of the East were
not less apprehensive of the arms of Rugilas, which threatened the
provinces, or even the capital. Some ecclesiastical historians have
destroyed the Barbarians with lightning and pestilence; <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> but
Theodosius was reduced to the more humble expedient of stipulating
an annual payment of three hundred and fifty pounds of gold, and of
disguising this dishonorable tribute by the title of general, which the
king of the Huns condescended to accept. The public tranquillity was
frequently interrupted by the fierce impatience of the Barbarians, and
the perfidious intrigues of the Byzantine court. Four dependent nations,
among whom we may distinguish the Barbarians, disclaimed the sovereignty
of the Huns; and their revolt was encouraged and protected by a Roman
alliance; till the just claims, and formidable power, of Rugilas, were
effectually urged by the voice of Eslaw his ambassador. Peace was the
unanimous wish of the senate: their decree was ratified by the emperor;
and two ambassadors were named, Plinthas, a general of Scythian
extraction, but of consular rank; and the quaestor Epigenes, a wise
and experienced statesman, who was recommended to that office by his
ambitious colleague.

[ Hungary has been successively occupied by three Scythian
colonies. 1. The Huns of Attila; 2. The Abares, in the sixth century;
and, 3. The Turks or Magiars, A.D. 889; the immediate and genuine
ancestors of the modern Hungarians, whose connection with the two former
is extremely faint and remote. The Prodromus and Notitia of Matthew
Belius appear to contain a rich fund of information concerning ancient
and modern Hungary. I have seen the extracts in Bibli otheque Ancienne
et Moderne, tom. xxii. p. 1-51, and Bibliotheque Raisonnee, tom. xvi. p.
127-175. * Note: Mailath (in his Geschichte der Magyaren) considers
the question of the origin of the Magyars as still undecided. The old
Hungarian chronicles unanimously derived them from the Huns of Attila
See note, vol. iv. pp. 341, 342. The later opinion, adopted by Schlozer,
Belnay, and Dankowsky, ascribes them, from their language, to the
Finnish race. Fessler, in his history of Hungary, agrees with Gibbon in
supposing them Turks. Mailath has inserted an ingenious dissertation
of Fejer, which attempts to connect them with the Parthians. Vol. i.

who always depends on the faith of his ecclesiastical authors,
strenuously contends (Hist. des Emp. tom. vi. p. 136, 607) that the wars

</p>
<p>
The death of Rugilas suspended the progress of the treaty. His two
nephews, Attila and Bleda, who succeeded to the throne of their
uncle, consented to a personal interview with the ambassadors of
Constantinople; but as they proudly refused to dismount, the business
was transacted on horseback, in a spacious plain near the city of
Margus, in the Upper Maesia. The kings of the Huns assumed the solid
benefits, as well as the vain honors, of the negotiation. They dictated
the conditions of peace, and each condition was an insult on the majesty
of the empire. Besides the freedom of a safe and plentiful market on the
banks of the Danube, they required that the annual contribution should
be augmented from three hundred and fifty to seven hundred pounds of
gold; that a fine or ransom of eight pieces of gold should be paid for
every Roman captive who had escaped from his Barbarian master; that the
emperor should renounce all treaties and engagements with the enemies of
the Huns; and that all the fugitives who had taken refuge in the court
or provinces of Theodosius, should be delivered to the justice of
their offended sovereign. This justice was rigorously inflicted on
some unfortunate youths of a royal race. They were crucified on the
territories of the empire, by the command of Attila: and as soon as the
king of the Huns had impressed the Romans with the terror of his name,
he indulged them in a short and arbitrary respite, whilst he subdued the
rebellious or independent nations of Scythia and Germany. <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a>

</p>
<p>
Attila, the son of Mundzuk, deduced his noble, perhaps his regal,
descent <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> from the ancient Huns, who had formerly contended with
the monarchs of China. His features, according to the observation of
a Gothic historian, bore the stamp of his national origin; and the
portrait of Attila exhibits the genuine deformity of a modern Calmuk;
<a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> a large head, a swarthy complexion, small, deep-seated eyes, a flat
nose, a few hairs in the place of a beard, broad shoulders, and a short
square body, of nervous strength, though of a disproportioned form.
The haughty step and demeanor of the king of the Huns expressed the
consciousness of his superiority above the rest of mankind; and he had a
custom of fiercely rolling his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy the terror
which he inspired. Yet this savage hero was not inaccessible to pity;
his suppliant enemies might confide in the assurance of peace or pardon;
and Attila was considered by his subjects as a just and indulgent
master. He delighted in war; but, after he had ascended the throne in a
mature age, his head, rather than his hand, achieved the conquest of the
North; and the fame of an adventurous soldier was usefully exchanged for
that of a prudent and successful general. The effects of personal valor
are so inconsiderable, except in poetry or romance, that victory, even
among Barbarians, must depend on the degree of skill with which the
passions of the multitude are combined and guided for the service of a
single man. The Scythian conquerors, Attila and Zingis, surpassed their
rude countrymen in art rather than in courage; and it may be observed
that the monarchies, both of the Huns and of the Moguls, were erected
by their founders on the basis of popular superstition The miraculous
conception, which fraud and credulity ascribed to the virgin-mother
of Zingis, raised him above the level of human nature; and the naked
prophet, who in the name of the Deity invested him with the empire of
the earth, pointed the valor of the Moguls with irresistible enthusiasm.
<a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> The religious arts of Attila were not less skillfully adapted to
the character of his age and country. It was natural enough that the
Scythians should adore, with peculiar devotion, the god of war; but as
they were incapable of forming either an abstract idea, or a corporeal
representation, they worshipped their tutelar deity under the symbol of
an iron cimeter. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> One of the shepherds of the Huns perceived, that a
heifer, who was grazing, had wounded herself in the foot, and curiously
followed the track of the blood, till he discovered, among the long
grass, the point of an ancient sword, which he dug out of the ground
and presented to Attila. That magnanimous, or rather that artful,
prince accepted, with pious gratitude, this celestial favor; and, as
the rightful possessor of the sword of Mars, asserted his divine and
indefeasible claim to the dominion of the earth. <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> If the rites of
Scythia were practised on this solemn occasion, a lofty altar, or rather
pile of fagots, three hundred yards in length and in breadth, was raised
in a spacious plain; and the sword of Mars was placed erect on the
summit of this rustic altar, which was annually consecrated by the
blood of sheep, horses, and of the hundredth captive. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> Whether
human sacrifices formed any part of the worship of Attila, or whether he
propitiated the god of war with the victims which he continually offered
in the field of battle, the favorite of Mars soon acquired a sacred
character, which rended his conquests more easy and more permanent;
and the Barbarian princes confessed, in the language of devotion or
flattery, that they could not presume to gaze, with a steady eye, on
the divine majesty of the king of the Huns. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> His brother Bleda, who
reigned over a considerable part of the nation, was compelled to resign
his sceptre and his life. Yet even this cruel act was attributed to a
supernatural impulse; and the vigor with which Attila wielded the sword
of Mars, convinced the world that it had been reserved alone for his
invincible arm. <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> But the extent of his empire affords the only
remaining evidence of the number and importance of his victories; and
the Scythian monarch, however ignorant of the value of science and
philosophy, might perhaps lament that his illiterate subjects were
destitute of the art which could perpetuate the memory of his exploits.

brother; and is almost inclined to reject the concurrent testimony of

</p>
<p>
If a line of separation were drawn between the civilized and the savage
climates of the globe; between the inhabitants of cities, who cultivated
the earth, and the hunters and shepherds, who dwelt in tents, Attila
might aspire to the title of supreme and sole monarch of the Barbarians.
<a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> He alone, among the conquerors of ancient and modern times,
united the two mighty kingdoms of Germany and Scythia; and those vague
appellations, when they are applied to his reign, may be understood with
an ample latitude. Thuringia, which stretched beyond its actual limits
as far as the Danube, was in the number of his provinces; he interposed,
with the weight of a powerful neighbor, in the domestic affairs of the
Franks; and one of his lieutenants chastised, and almost exterminated,
the Burgundians of the Rhine.
</p>
<p>
He subdued the islands of the ocean, the kingdoms of Scandinavia,
encompassed and divided by the waters of the Baltic; and the Huns might
derive a tribute of furs from that northern region, which has been
protected from all other conquerors by the severity of the climate,
and the courage of the natives. Towards the East, it is difficult to
circumscribe the dominion of Attila over the Scythian deserts; yet we
may be assured, that he reigned on the banks of the Volga; that the king
of the Huns was dreaded, not only as a warrior, but as a magician; <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a>
that he insulted and vanquished the khan of the formidable Geougen; and
that he sent ambassadors to negotiate an equal alliance with the empire
of China. In the proud review of the nations who acknowledged the
sovereignty of Attila, and who never entertained, during his
lifetime, the thought of a revolt, the Gepidae and the Ostrogoths were
distinguished by their numbers, their bravery, and the personal merits
of their chiefs. The renowned Ardaric, king of the Gepidae, was the
faithful and sagacious counsellor of the monarch, who esteemed his
intrepid genius, whilst he loved the mild and discreet virtues of the
noble Walamir, king of the Ostrogoths. The crowd of vulgar kings, the
leaders of so many martial tribes, who served under the standard of
Attila, were ranged in the submissive order of guards and domestics
round the person of their master. They watched his nod; they trembled at
his frown; and at the first signal of his will, they executed, without
murmur or hesitation, his stern and absolute commands. In time of peace,
the dependent princes, with their national troops, attended the royal
camp in regular succession; but when Attila collected his military
force, he was able to bring into the field an army of five, or,
according to another account, of seven hundred thousand Barbarians. <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The ambassadors of the Huns might awaken the attention of Theodosius,
by reminding him that they were his neighbors both in Europe and Asia;
since they touched the Danube on one hand, and reached, with the other,
as far as the Tanais. In the reign of his father Arcadius, a band of
adventurous Huns had ravaged the provinces of the East; from whence they
brought away rich spoils and innumerable captives. <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> They advanced,
by a secret path, along the shores of the Caspian Sea; traversed the
snowy mountains of Armenia; passed the Tigris, the Euphrates, and
the Halys; recruited their weary cavalry with the generous breed of
Cappadocian horses; occupied the hilly country of Cilicia, and disturbed
the festal songs and dances of the citizens of Antioch. Egypt trembled
at their approach; and the monks and pilgrims of the Holy Land prepared
to escaped their fury by a speedy embarkation. The memory of this
invasion was still recent in the minds of the Orientals. The subjects
of Attila might execute, with superior forces, the design which these
adventurers had so boldly attempted; and it soon became the subject of
anxious conjecture, whether the tempest would fall on the dominions of
Rome, or of Persia. Some of the great vassals of the king of the Huns,
who were themselves in the rank of powerful princes, had been sent to
ratify an alliance and society of arms with the emperor, or rather with
the general of the West. They related, during their residence at Rome,
the circumstances of an expedition, which they had lately made into the
East. After passing a desert and a morass, supposed by the Romans to be
the Lake Maeotis, they penetrated through the mountains, and arrived,
at the end of fifteen days' march, on the confines of Media; where they
advanced as far as the unknown cities of Basic and Cursic. <a href="#note-1611" name="noteref-1611"><small>1611</small></a>
They encountered the Persian army in the plains of Media and the air,
according to their own expression, was darkened by a cloud of arrows.
But the Huns were obliged to retire before the numbers of the enemy.
Their laborious retreat was effected by a different road; they lost the
greatest part of their booty; and at length returned to the royal camp,
with some knowledge of the country, and an impatient desire of revenge.
In the free conversation of the Imperial ambassadors, who discussed,
at the court of Attila, the character and designs of their formidable
enemy, the ministers of Constantinople expressed their hope, that his
strength might be diverted and employed in a long and doubtful contest
with the princes of the house of Sassan. The more sagacious Italians
admonished their Eastern brethren of the folly and danger of such a
hope; and convinced them, that the Medes and Persians were incapable
of resisting the arms of the Huns; and that the easy and important
acquisition would exalt the pride, as well as power, of the conqueror.
Instead of contenting himself with a moderate contribution, and a
military title, which equalled him only to the generals of Theodosius,
Attila would proceed to impose a disgraceful and intolerable yoke on
the necks of the prostrate and captive Romans, who would then be
encompassed, on all sides, by the empire of the Huns. <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a>

While the powers of Europe and Asia were solicitous to avert the
impending danger, the alliance of Attila maintained the Vandals in
the possession of Africa. An enterprise had been concerted between the
courts of Ravenna and Constantinople, for the recovery of that valuable
province; and the ports of Sicily were already filled with the military
and naval forces of Theodosius. But the subtle Genseric, who spread his
negotiations round the world, prevented their designs, by exciting the
king of the Huns to invade the Eastern empire; and a trifling incident
soon became the motive, or pretence, of a destructive war. <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> Under
the faith of the treaty of Margus, a free market was held on the
Northern side of the Danube, which was protected by a Roman fortress
surnamed Constantia. A troop of Barbarians violated the commercial
security; killed, or dispersed, the unsuspecting traders; and levelled
the fortress with the ground. The Huns justified this outrage as an
act of reprisal; alleged, that the bishop of Margus had entered their
territories, to discover and steal a secret treasure of their kings;
and sternly demanded the guilty prelate, the sacrilegious spoil, and
the fugitive subjects, who had escaped from the justice of Attila. The
refusal of the Byzantine court was the signal of war; and the Maesians
at first applauded the generous firmness of their sovereign. But they
were soon intimidated by the destruction of Viminiacum and the adjacent
towns; and the people was persuaded to adopt the convenient maxim,
that a private citizen, however innocent or respectable, may be justly
sacrificed to the safety of his country. The bishop of Margus, who did
not possess the spirit of a martyr, resolved to prevent the designs
which he suspected. He boldly treated with the princes of the Huns:
secured, by solemn oaths, his pardon and reward; posted a numerous
detachment of Barbarians, in silent ambush, on the banks of the Danube;
and, at the appointed hour, opened, with his own hand, the gates of his
episcopal city. This advantage, which had been obtained by treachery,
served as a prelude to more honorable and decisive victories. The
Illyrian frontier was covered by a line of castles and fortresses; and
though the greatest part of them consisted only of a single tower,
with a small garrison, they were commonly sufficient to repel, or to
intercept, the inroads of an enemy, who was ignorant of the art, and
impatient of the delay, of a regular siege. But these slight obstacles
were instantly swept away by the inundation of the Huns. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> They
destroyed, with fire and sword, the populous cities of Sirmium and
Singidunum, of Ratiaria and Marcianopolis, of Naissus and Sardica; where
every circumstance of the discipline of the people, and the construction
of the buildings, had been gradually adapted to the sole purpose of
defence. The whole breadth of Europe, as it extends above five hundred
miles from the Euxine to the Hadriatic, was at once invaded, and
occupied, and desolated, by the myriads of Barbarians whom Attila led
into the field. The public danger and distress could not, however,
provoke Theodosius to interrupt his amusements and devotion, or to
appear in person at the head of the Roman legions. But the troops, which
had been sent against Genseric, were hastily recalled from Sicily; the
garrisons, on the side of Persia, were exhausted; and a military force
was collected in Europe, formidable by their arms and numbers, if the
generals had understood the science of command, and the soldiers the
duty of obedience. The armies of the Eastern empire were vanquished in
three successive engagements; and the progress of Attila may be traced
by the fields of battle.
</p>
<p>
The two former, on the banks of the Utus, and under the walls of
Marcianopolis, were fought in the extensive plains between the Danube
and Mount Haemus. As the Romans were pressed by a victorious enemy, they
gradually, and unskilfully, retired towards the Chersonesus of Thrace;
and that narrow peninsula, the last extremity of the land, was marked by
their third, and irreparable, defeat. By the destruction of this army,
Attila acquired the indisputable possession of the field. From the
Hellespont to Thermopylae, and the suburbs of Constantinople, he
ravaged, without resistance, and without mercy, the provinces of Thrace
and Macedonia. Heraclea and Hadrianople might, perhaps, escape this
dreadful irruption of the Huns; but the words, the most expressive of
total extirpation and erasure, are applied to the calamities which they
inflicted on seventy cities of the Eastern empire. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> Theodosius,
his court, and the unwarlike people, were protected by the walls of
Constantinople; but those walls had been shaken by a recent earthquake,
and the fall of fifty-eight towers had opened a large and tremendous
breach. The damage indeed was speedily repaired; but this accident was
aggravated by a superstitious fear, that Heaven itself had delivered
the Imperial city to the shepherds of Scythia, who were strangers to the
laws, the language, and the religion, of the Romans. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a>

<p>
In all their invasions of the civilized empires of the South, the
Scythian shepherds have been uniformly actuated by a savage and
destructive spirit. The laws of war, that restrain the exercise of
national rapine and murder, are founded on two principles of substantial
interest: the knowledge of the permanent benefits which may be obtained
by a moderate use of conquest; and a just apprehension, lest the
desolation which we inflict on the enemy's country may be retaliated on
our own. But these considerations of hope and fear are almost unknown
in the pastoral state of nations. The Huns of Attila may, without
injustice, be compared to the Moguls and Tartars, before their primitive
manners were changed by religion and luxury; and the evidence of
Oriental history may reflect some light on the short and imperfect
annals of Rome. After the Moguls had subdued the northern provinces
of China, it was seriously proposed, not in the hour of victory
and passion, but in calm deliberate council, to exterminate all the
inhabitants of that populous country, that the vacant land might be
converted to the pasture of cattle. The firmness of a Chinese mandarin,
<a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> who insinuated some principles of rational policy into the mind of
Zingis, diverted him from the execution of this horrid design. But in
the cities of Asia, which yielded to the Moguls, the inhuman abuse of
the rights of war was exercised with a regular form of discipline, which
may, with equal reason, though not with equal authority, be imputed
to the victorious Huns. The inhabitants, who had submitted to their
discretion, were ordered to evacuate their houses, and to assemble
in some plain adjacent to the city; where a division was made of the
vanquished into three parts. The first class consisted of the soldiers
of the garrison, and of the young men capable of bearing arms; and their
fate was instantly decided they were either enlisted among the Moguls,
or they were massacred on the spot by the troops, who, with pointed
spears and bended bows, had formed a circle round the captive multitude.
The second class, composed of the young and beautiful women, of the
artificers of every rank and profession, and of the more wealthy or
honorable citizens, from whom a private ransom might be expected, was
distributed in equal or proportionable lots. The remainder, whose life
or death was alike useless to the conquerors, were permitted to return
to the city; which, in the mean while, had been stripped of its valuable
furniture; and a tax was imposed on those wretched inhabitants for the
indulgence of breathing their native air. Such was the behavior of the
Moguls, when they were not conscious of any extraordinary rigor. <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a>
But the most casual provocation, the slightest motive of caprice
or convenience, often provoked them to involve a whole people in an
indiscriminate massacre; and the ruin of some flourishing cities was
executed with such unrelenting perseverance, that, according to their
own expression, horses might run, without stumbling, over the ground
where they had once stood. The three great capitals of Khorasan, Maru,
Neisabour, and Herat, were destroyed by the armies of Zingis; and the
exact account which was taken of the slain amounted to four millions
three hundred and forty-seven thousand persons. <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> Timur, or
Tamerlane, was educated in a less barbarous age, and in the profession
of the Mahometan religion; yet, if Attila equalled the hostile ravages
of Tamerlane, <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> either the Tartar or the Hun might deserve the

<h2>
    Chapter XXXIV: Attila.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
It may be affirmed, with bolder assurance, that the Huns depopulated the
provinces of the empire, by the number of Roman subjects whom they
led away into captivity. In the hands of a wise legislator, such an
industrious colony might have contributed to diffuse through the deserts
of Scythia the rudiments of the useful and ornamental arts; but these
captives, who had been taken in war, were accidentally dispersed among
the hordes that obeyed the empire of Attila. The estimate of their
respective value was formed by the simple judgment of unenlightened and
unprejudiced Barbarians. Perhaps they might not understand the merit of
a theologian, profoundly skilled in the controversies of the Trinity and
the Incarnation; yet they respected the ministers of every religion and
the active zeal of the Christian missionaries, without approaching
the person or the palace of the monarch, successfully labored in the
propagation of the gospel. <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> The pastoral tribes, who were ignorant
of the distinction of landed property, must have disregarded the use, as
well as the abuse, of civil jurisprudence; and the skill of an eloquent
lawyer could excite only their contempt or their abhorrence. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> The
perpetual intercourse of the Huns and the Goths had communicated the
familiar knowledge of the two national dialects; and the Barbarians were
ambitious of conversing in Latin, the military idiom even of the Eastern
empire. <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> But they disdained the language and the sciences of the
Greeks; and the vain sophist, or grave philosopher, who had enjoyed
the flattering applause of the schools, was mortified to find that his
robust servant was a captive of more value and importance than himself.
The mechanic arts were encouraged and esteemed, as they tended to
satisfy the wants of the Huns. An architect in the service of Onegesius,
one of the favorites of Attila, was employed to construct a bath; but
this work was a rare example of private luxury; and the trades of the
smith, the carpenter, the armorer, were much more adapted to supply a
wandering people with the useful instruments of peace and war. But the
merit of the physician was received with universal favor and respect:
the Barbarians, who despised death, might be apprehensive of disease;
and the haughty conqueror trembled in the presence of a captive, to whom
he ascribed, perhaps, an imaginary power of prolonging or preserving
his life. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> The Huns might be provoked to insult the misery of their
slaves, over whom they exercised a despotic command; <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> but their
manners were not susceptible of a refined system of oppression; and the
efforts of courage and diligence were often recompensed by the gift of
freedom. The historian Priscus, whose embassy is a source of curious
instruction, was accosted in the camp of Attila by a stranger, who
saluted him in the Greek language, but whose dress and figure displayed
the appearance of a wealthy Scythian. In the siege of Viminiacum, he had
lost, according to his own account, his fortune and liberty; he became
the slave of Onegesius; but his faithful services, against the Romans
and the Acatzires, had gradually raised him to the rank of the native
Huns; to whom he was attached by the domestic pledges of a new wife
and several children. The spoils of war had restored and improved his
private property; he was admitted to the table of his former lord; and
the apostate Greek blessed the hour of his captivity, since it had been
the introduction to a happy and independent state; which he held by the
honorable tenure of military service. This reflection naturally produced
a dispute on the advantages and defects of the Roman government, which
was severely arraigned by the apostate, and defended by Priscus in a
prolix and feeble declamation. The freedman of Onegesius exposed, in
true and lively colors, the vices of a declining empire, of which he
had so long been the victim; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes,
unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to
trust them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable weight of
taxes, rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or arbitrary
modes of collection; the obscurity of numerous and contradictory laws;
the tedious and expensive forms of judicial proceedings; the partial
administration of justice; and the universal corruption, which increased
the influence of the rich, and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor.
A sentiment of patriotic sympathy was at length revived in the breast of
the fortunate exile; and he lamented, with a flood of tears, the guilt
or weakness of those magistrates who had perverted the wisest and most
salutary institutions. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a>

The timid or selfish policy of the Western Romans had abandoned the
Eastern empire to the Huns. <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> The loss of armies, and the want of
discipline or virtue, were not supplied by the personal character of the
monarch. Theodosius might still affect the style, as well as the title,
of Invincible Augustus; but he was reduced to solicit the clemency of
Attila, who imperiously dictated these harsh and humiliating conditions
of peace. I. The emperor of the East resigned, by an express or tacit
convention, an extensive and important territory, which stretched along
the southern banks of the Danube, from Singidunum, or Belgrade, as far
as Novae, in the diocese of Thrace. The breadth was defined by the vague
computation of fifteen <a href="#note-3311" name="noteref-3311"><small>3311</small></a> days' journey; but, from the proposal of
Attila to remove the situation of the national market, it soon appeared,
that he comprehended the ruined city of Naissus within the limits of
his dominions. II. The king of the Huns required and obtained, that his
tribute or subsidy should be augmented from seven hundred pounds of gold
to the annual sum of two thousand one hundred; and he stipulated
the immediate payment of six thousand pounds of gold, to defray the
expenses, or to expiate the guilt, of the war. One might imagine, that
such a demand, which scarcely equalled the measure of private wealth,
would have been readily discharged by the opulent empire of the East;
and the public distress affords a remarkable proof of the impoverished,
or at least of the disorderly, state of the finances. A large proportion
of the taxes extorted from the people was detained and intercepted
in their passage, though the foulest channels, to the treasury of
Constantinople. The revenue was dissipated by Theodosius and his
favorites in wasteful and profuse luxury; which was disguised by the
names of Imperial magnificence, or Christian charity. The immediate
supplies had been exhausted by the unforeseen necessity of military
preparations. A personal contribution, rigorously, but capriciously,
imposed on the members of the senatorian order, was the only expedient
that could disarm, without loss of time, the impatient avarice of
Attila; and the poverty of the nobles compelled them to adopt the
scandalous resource of exposing to public auction the jewels of their
wives, and the hereditary ornaments of their palaces. <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> III. The
king of the Huns appears to have established, as a principle of national
jurisprudence, that he could never lose the property, which he had
once acquired, in the persons who had yielded either a voluntary,
or reluctant, submission to his authority. From this principle he
concluded, and the conclusions of Attila were irrevocable laws, that
the Huns, who had been taken prisoner in war, should be released without
delay, and without ransom; that every Roman captive, who had presumed
to escape, should purchase his right to freedom at the price of twelve
pieces of gold; and that all the Barbarians, who had deserted the
standard of Attila, should be restored, without any promise or
stipulation of pardon.
</p>
<p>
In the execution of this cruel and ignominious treaty, the Imperial
officers were forced to massacre several loyal and noble deserters, who
refused to devote themselves to certain death; and the Romans forfeited
all reasonable claims to the friendship of any Scythian people, by this
public confession, that they were destitute either of faith, or power,
to protect the suppliant, who had embraced the throne of Theodosius.

</p>
<p>
The firmness of a single town, so obscure, that, except on this
occasion, it has never been mentioned by any historian or geographer,
exposed the disgrace of the emperor and empire. Azimus, or Azimuntium,
a small city of Thrace on the Illyrian borders, <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> had been
distinguished by the martial spirit of its youth, the skill and
reputation of the leaders whom they had chosen, and their daring
exploits against the innumerable host of the Barbarians. Instead of
tamely expecting their approach, the Azimuntines attacked, in frequent
and successful sallies, the troops of the Huns, who gradually declined
the dangerous neighborhood, rescued from their hands the spoil and
the captives, and recruited their domestic force by the voluntary
association of fugitives and deserters. After the conclusion of the
treaty, Attila still menaced the empire with implacable war, unless the
Azimuntines were persuaded, or compelled, to comply with the conditions
which their sovereign had accepted. The ministers of Theodosius
confessed with shame, and with truth, that they no longer possessed any
authority over a society of men, who so bravely asserted their natural
independence; and the king of the Huns condescended to negotiate
an equal exchange with the citizens of Azimus. They demanded the
restitution of some shepherds, who, with their cattle, had been
accidentally surprised. A strict, though fruitless, inquiry was allowed:
but the Huns were obliged to swear, that they did not detain any
prisoners belonging to the city, before they could recover two surviving
countrymen, whom the Azimuntines had reserved as pledges for the safety
of their lost companions. Attila, on his side, was satisfied, and
deceived, by their solemn asseveration, that the rest of the captives
had been put to the sword; and that it was their constant practice,
immediately to dismiss the Romans and the deserters, who had
obtained the security of the public faith. This prudent and officious
dissimulation may be condemned, or excused, by the casuists, as they
incline to the rigid decree of St. Augustin, or to the milder sentiment
of St. Jerom and St. Chrysostom: but every soldier, every statesman,
must acknowledge, that, if the race of the Azimuntines had been
encouraged and multiplied, the Barbarians would have ceased to trample
on the majesty of the empire. <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a>

It would have been strange, indeed, if Theodosius had purchased, by the
loss of honor, a secure and solid tranquillity, or if his tameness had
not invited the repetition of injuries. The Byzantine court was insulted
by five or six successive embassies; <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> and the ministers of Attila
were uniformly instructed to press the tardy or imperfect execution of
the last treaty; to produce the names of fugitives and deserters,
who were still protected by the empire; and to declare, with seeming
moderation, that, unless their sovereign obtained complete and immediate
satisfaction, it would be impossible for him, were it even his wish, to
check the resentment of his warlike tribes. Besides the motives of pride
and interest, which might prompt the king of the Huns to continue this
train of negotiation, he was influenced by the less honorable view of
enriching his favorites at the expense of his enemies. The Imperial
treasury was exhausted, to procure the friendly offices of the
ambassadors and their principal attendants, whose favorable report might
conduce to the maintenance of peace. The Barbarian monarch was flattered
by the liberal reception of his ministers; he computed, with pleasure,
the value and splendor of their gifts, rigorously exacted the
performance of every promise which would contribute to their private
emolument, and treated as an important business of state the marriage
of his secretary Constantius. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> That Gallic adventurer, who was
recommended by Aetius to the king of the Huns, had engaged his service
to the ministers of Constantinople, for the stipulated reward of a
wealthy and noble wife; and the daughter of Count Saturninus was chosen
to discharge the obligations of her country. The reluctance of the
victim, some domestic troubles, and the unjust confiscation of her
fortune, cooled the ardor of her interested lover; but he still
demanded, in the name of Attila, an equivalent alliance; and, after
many ambiguous delays and excuses, the Byzantine court was compelled to
sacrifice to this insolent stranger the widow of Armatius, whose birth,
opulence, and beauty, placed her in the most illustrious rank of the
Roman matrons. For these importunate and oppressive embassies, Attila
claimed a suitable return: he weighed, with suspicious pride, the
character and station of the Imperial envoys; but he condescended to
promise that he would advance as far as Sardica to receive any ministers
who had been invested with the consular dignity. The council of
Theodosius eluded this proposal, by representing the desolate and ruined
condition of Sardica, and even ventured to insinuate that every officer
of the army or household was qualified to treat with the most powerful
princes of Scythia. Maximin, <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> a respectable courtier, whose
abilities had been long exercised in civil and military employments,
accepted, with reluctance, the troublesome, and perhaps dangerous,
commission of reconciling the angry spirit of the king of the Huns.
His friend, the historian Priscus, <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> embraced the opportunity of
observing the Barbarian hero in the peaceful and domestic scenes of
life: but the secret of the embassy, a fatal and guilty secret, was
intrusted only to the interpreter Vigilius. The two last ambassadors
of the Huns, Orestes, a noble subject of the Pannonian province, and
Edecon, a valiant chieftain of the tribe of the Scyrri, returned at the
same time from Constantinople to the royal camp. Their obscure names
were afterwards illustrated by the extraordinary fortune and the
contrast of their sons: the two servants of Attila became the fathers of
the last Roman emperor of the West, and of the first Barbarian king of
Italy.

The ambassadors, who were followed by a numerous train of men and
horses, made their first halt at Sardica, at the distance of three
hundred and fifty miles, or thirteen days' journey, from Constantinople.
As the remains of Sardica were still included within the limits of
the empire, it was incumbent on the Romans to exercise the duties of
hospitality. They provided, with the assistance of the provincials, a
sufficient number of sheep and oxen, and invited the Huns to a splendid,
or at least, a plentiful supper. But the harmony of the entertainment
was soon disturbed by mutual prejudice and indiscretion. The greatness
of the emperor and the empire was warmly maintained by their ministers;
the Huns, with equal ardor, asserted the superiority of their victorious
monarch: the dispute was inflamed by the rash and unseasonable flattery
of Vigilius, who passionately rejected the comparison of a mere mortal
with the divine Theodosius; and it was with extreme difficulty that
Maximin and Priscus were able to divert the conversation, or to soothe
the angry minds, of the Barbarians. When they rose from table, the
Imperial ambassador presented Edecon and Orestes with rich gifts of silk
robes and Indian pearls, which they thankfully accepted. Yet Orestes
could not forbear insinuating that he had not always been treated with
such respect and liberality: and the offensive distinction which
was implied, between his civil office and the hereditary rank of his
colleague seems to have made Edecon a doubtful friend, and Orestes an
irreconcilable enemy. After this entertainment, they travelled about one
hundred miles from Sardica to Naissus. That flourishing city, which has
given birth to the great Constantine, was levelled with the ground: the
inhabitants were destroyed or dispersed; and the appearance of some
sick persons, who were still permitted to exist among the ruins of
the churches, served only to increase the horror of the prospect. The
surface of the country was covered with the bones of the slain; and the
ambassadors, who directed their course to the north-west, were obliged
to pass the hills of modern Servia, before they descended into the flat
and marshy grounds which are terminated by the Danube. The Huns were
masters of the great river: their navigation was performed in large
canoes, hollowed out of the trunk of a single tree; the ministers of
Theodosius were safely landed on the opposite bank; and their Barbarian
associates immediately hastened to the camp of Attila, which was equally
prepared for the amusements of hunting or of war. No sooner had Maximin
advanced about two miles <a href="#note-4111" name="noteref-4111"><small>4111</small></a> from the Danube, than he began to
experience the fastidious insolence of the conqueror. He was sternly
forbid to pitch his tents in a pleasant valley, lest he should infringe
the distant awe that was due to the royal mansion. <a href="#note-4112" name="noteref-4112"><small>4112</small></a> The
ministers of Attila pressed them to communicate the business, and the
instructions, which he reserved for the ear of their sovereign When
Maximin temperately urged the contrary practice of nations, he was still
more confounded to find that the resolutions of the Sacred Consistory,
those secrets (says Priscus) which should not be revealed to the gods
themselves, had been treacherously disclosed to the public enemy. On his
refusal to comply with such ignominious terms, the Imperial envoy was
commanded instantly to depart; the order was recalled; it was again
repeated; and the Huns renewed their ineffectual attempts to subdue the
patient firmness of Maximin. At length, by the intercession of Scotta,
the brother of Onegesius, whose friendship had been purchased by a
liberal gift, he was admitted to the royal presence; but, in stead of
obtaining a decisive answer, he was compelled to undertake a
remote journey towards the north, that Attila might enjoy the proud
satisfaction of receiving, in the same camp, the ambassadors of the
Eastern and Western empires. His journey was regulated by the guides,
who obliged him to halt, to hasten his march, or to deviate from the
common road, as it best suited the convenience of the king. The Romans,
who traversed the plains of Hungary, suppose that they passed several
navigable rivers, either in canoes or portable boats; but there is
reason to suspect that the winding stream of the Teyss, or Tibiscus,
might present itself in different places under different names. From
the contiguous villages they received a plentiful and regular supply of
provisions; mead instead of wine, millet in the place of bread, and a
certain liquor named camus, which according to the report of Priscus,
was distilled from barley. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> Such fare might appear coarse and
indelicate to men who had tasted the luxury of Constantinople; but,
in their accidental distress, they were relieved by the gentleness and
hospitality of the same Barbarians, so terrible and so merciless in war.
The ambassadors had encamped on the edge of a large morass. A violent
tempest of wind and rain, of thunder and lightning, overturned their
tents, immersed their baggage and furniture in the water, and scattered
their retinue, who wandered in the darkness of the night, uncertain of
their road, and apprehensive of some unknown danger, till they awakened
by their cries the inhabitants of a neighboring village, the property
of the widow of Bleda. A bright illumination, and, in a few moments, a
comfortable fire of reeds, was kindled by their officious benevolence;
the wants, and even the desires, of the Romans were liberally satisfied;
and they seem to have been embarrassed by the singular politeness of
Bleda's widow, who added to her other favors the gift, or at least the
loan, of a sufficient number of beautiful and obsequious damsels. The
sunshine of the succeeding day was dedicated to repose, to collect and
dry the baggage, and to the refreshment of the men and horses: but,
in the evening, before they pursued their journey, the ambassadors
expressed their gratitude to the bounteous lady of the village, by a
very acceptable present of silver cups, red fleeces, dried fruits, and
Indian pepper. Soon after this adventure, they rejoined the march of
Attila, from whom they had been separated about six days, and slowly
proceeded to the capital of an empire, which did not contain, in the
space of several thousand miles, a single city.

[ The Huns themselves still continued to despise the labors
of agriculture: they abused the privilege of a victorious nation; and
the Goths, their industrious subjects, who cultivated the earth, dreaded
their neighborhood, like that of so many ravenous wolves, (Priscus,
p. 45.) In the same manner the Sarts and Tadgics provide for their own
subsistence, and for that of the Usbec Tartars, their lazy and rapacious
sovereigns. See Genealogical History of the Tartars, p. 423 455, &amp;c.]
</p>
<p>
As far as we may ascertain the vague and obscure geography of Priscus,
this capital appears to have been seated between the Danube, the Teyss,
and the Carpathian hills, in the plains of Upper Hungary, and most
probably in the neighborhood of Jezberin, Agria, or Tokay. <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> In its
origin it could be no more than an accidental camp, which, by the long
and frequent residence of Attila, had insensibly swelled into a huge
village, for the reception of his court, of the troops who followed his
person, and of the various multitude of idle or industrious slaves
and retainers. <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> The baths, constructed by Onegesius, were the only
edifice of stone; the materials had been transported from Pannonia; and
since the adjacent country was destitute even of large timber, it may be
presumed, that the meaner habitations of the royal village consisted of
straw, or mud, or of canvass. The wooden houses of the more illustrious
Huns were built and adorned with rude magnificence, according to the
rank, the fortune, or the taste of the proprietors. They seem to have
been distributed with some degree of order and symmetry; and each spot
became more honorable as it approached the person of the sovereign. The
palace of Attila, which surpassed all other houses in his dominions,
was built entirely of wood, and covered an ample space of ground.
The outward enclosure was a lofty wall, or palisade, of smooth square
timber, intersected with high towers, but intended rather for ornament
than defence. This wall, which seems to have encircled the declivity of
a hill, comprehended a great variety of wooden edifices, adapted to the
uses of royalty.
</p>
<p>
A separate house was assigned to each of the numerous wives of Attila;
and, instead of the rigid and illiberal confinement imposed by Asiatic
jealousy they politely admitted the Roman ambassadors to their presence,
their table, and even to the freedom of an innocent embrace. When
Maximin offered his presents to Cerca, <a href="#note-4411" name="noteref-4411"><small>4411</small></a> the principal queen, he
admired the singular architecture on her mansion, the height of the
round columns, the size and beauty of the wood, which was curiously
shaped or turned or polished or carved; and his attentive eye was able
to discover some taste in the ornaments and some regularity in the
proportions. After passing through the guards, who watched before the
gate, the ambassadors were introduced into the private apartment of
Cerca. The wife of Attila received their visit sitting, or rather lying,
on a soft couch; the floor was covered with a carpet; the domestics
formed a circle round the queen; and her damsels, seated on the ground,
were employed in working the variegated embroidery which adorned the
dress of the Barbaric warriors. The Huns were ambitious of displaying
those riches which were the fruit and evidence of their victories: the
trappings of their horses, their swords, and even their shoes, were
studded with gold and precious stones; and their tables were profusely
spread with plates, and goblets, and vases of gold and silver, which had
been fashioned by the labor of Grecian artists.
</p>
<p>
The monarch alone assumed the superior pride of still adhering to the
simplicity of his Scythian ancestors. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> The dress of Attila, his
arms, and the furniture of his horse, were plain, without ornament,
and of a single color. The royal table was served in wooden cups and
platters; flesh was his only food; and the conqueror of the North never
tasted the luxury of bread.

was situated, in the same parallel stands the present city of Buda, in
Hungarian Buduvur. It is for this reason that this city has retained
for a long time among the Germans of Hungary the name of Etzelnburgh or
Etzela-burgh, i. e., the city of Attila. The distance of Buda from the
place where Priscus crossed the Danube, on his way from Naissus, is
equal to that which he traversed to reach the residence of the king of
the Huns. I see no good reason for not acceding to the relations of the

<p>
When Attila first gave audience to the Roman ambassadors on the banks
of the Danube, his tent was encompassed with a formidable guard. The
monarch himself was seated in a wooden chair. His stern countenance,
angry gestures, and impatient tone, astonished the firmness of Maximin;
but Vigilius had more reason to tremble, since he distinctly understood
the menace, that if Attila did not respect the law of nations, he would
nail the deceitful interpreter to the cross. and leave his body to the
vultures. The Barbarian condescended, by producing an accurate list,
to expose the bold falsehood of Vigilius, who had affirmed that no more
than seventeen deserters could be found. But he arrogantly declared,
that he apprehended only the disgrace of contending with his fugitive
slaves; since he despised their impotent efforts to defend the provinces
which Theodosius had intrusted to their arms: "For what fortress,"
(added Attila,) "what city, in the wide extent of the Roman empire, can
hope to exist, secure and impregnable, if it is our pleasure that
it should be erased from the earth?" He dismissed, however, the
interpreter, who returned to Constantinople with his peremptory demand
of more complete restitution, and a more splendid embassy.
</p>
<p>
His anger gradually subsided, and his domestic satisfaction in a
marriage which he celebrated on the road with the daughter of Eslam,
<a href="#note-4511" name="noteref-4511"><small>4511</small></a> might perhaps contribute to mollify the native fierceness of his
temper. The entrance of Attila into the royal village was marked by a
very singular ceremony. A numerous troop of women came out to meet their
hero and their king. They marched before him, distributed into long
and regular files; the intervals between the files were filled by white
veils of thin linen, which the women on either side bore aloft in their
hands, and which formed a canopy for a chorus of young virgins, who
chanted hymns and songs in the Scythian language. The wife of his
favorite Onegesius, with a train of female attendants, saluted Attila
at the door of her own house, on his way to the palace; and offered,
according to the custom of the country, her respectful homage, by
entreating him to taste the wine and meat which she had prepared for his
reception. As soon as the monarch had graciously accepted her hospitable
gift, his domestics lifted a small silver table to a convenient height,
as he sat on horseback; and Attila, when he had touched the goblet with
his lips, again saluted the wife of Onegesius, and continued his march.
During his residence at the seat of empire, his hours were not wasted
in the recluse idleness of a seraglio; and the king of the Huns could
maintain his superior dignity, without concealing his person from the
public view. He frequently assembled his council, and gave audience
to the ambassadors of the nations; and his people might appeal to the
supreme tribunal, which he held at stated times, and, according to the
Eastern custom, before the principal gate of his wooden palace. The
Romans, both of the East and of the West, were twice invited to the
banquets, where Attila feasted with the princes and nobles of Scythia.
Maximin and his colleagues were stopped on the threshold, till they had
made a devout libation to the health and prosperity of the king of the
Huns; and were conducted, after this ceremony, to their respective seats
in a spacious hall. The royal table and couch, covered with carpets and
fine linen, was raised by several steps in the midst of the hall; and
a son, an uncle, or perhaps a favorite king, were admitted to share the
simple and homely repast of Attila. Two lines of small tables, each of
which contained three or four guests, were ranged in order on either
hand; the right was esteemed the most honorable, but the Romans
ingenuously confess, that they were placed on the left; and that Beric,
an unknown chieftain, most probably of the Gothic race, preceded the
representatives of Theodosius and Valentinian. The Barbarian monarch
received from his cup-bearer a goblet filled with wine, and courteously
drank to the health of the most distinguished guest; who rose from his
seat, and expressed, in the same manner, his loyal and respectful vows.
This ceremony was successively performed for all, or at least for the
illustrious persons of the assembly; and a considerable time must have
been consumed, since it was thrice repeated as each course or service
was placed on the table. But the wine still remained after the meat had
been removed; and the Huns continued to indulge their intemperance long
after the sober and decent ambassadors of the two empires had withdrawn
themselves from the nocturnal banquet. Yet before they retired, they
enjoyed a singular opportunity of observing the manners of the nation
in their convivial amusements. Two Scythians stood before the couch of
Attila, and recited the verses which they had composed, to celebrate
his valor and his victories. <a href="#note-4512" name="noteref-4512"><small>4512</small></a> A profound silence prevailed in
the hall; and the attention of the guests was captivated by the vocal
harmony, which revived and perpetuated the memory of their own exploits;
a martial ardor flashed from the eyes of the warriors, who were
impatient for battle; and the tears of the old men expressed their
generous despair, that they could no longer partake the danger and glory
of the field. <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> This entertainment, which might be considered as a
school of military virtue, was succeeded by a farce, that debased
the dignity of human nature. A Moorish and a Scythian buffcon
successively excited the mirth of the rude spectators, by their deformed
figure, ridiculous dress, antic gestures, absurd speeches, and the
strange, unintelligible confusion of the Latin, the Gothic, and the
Hunnic languages; and the hall resounded with loud and licentious
peals of laughter. In the midst of this intemperate riot, Attila alone,
without a change of countenance, maintained his steadfast and inflexible
gravity; which was never relaxed, except on the entrance of Irnac,
the youngest of his sons: he embraced the boy with a smile of paternal
tenderness, gently pinched him by the cheek, and betrayed a partial
affection, which was justified by the assurance of his prophets, that
Irnac would be the future support of his family and empire. Two days
afterwards, the ambassadors received a second invitation; and they had
reason to praise the politeness, as well as the hospitality, of Attila.
The king of the Huns held a long and familiar conversation with Maximin;
but his civility was interrupted by rude expressions and haughty
reproaches; and he was provoked, by a motive of interest, to support,
with unbecoming zeal, the private claims of his secretary Constantius.
</p>
<p>
"The emperor" (said Attila) "has long promised him a rich wife:
Constantius must not be disappointed; nor should a Roman emperor deserve
the name of liar." On the third day, the ambassadors were dismissed; the
freedom of several captives was granted, for a moderate ransom, to
their pressing entreaties; and, besides the royal presents, they were
permitted to accept from each of the Scythian nobles the honorable
and useful gift of a horse. Maximin returned, by the same road, to
Constantinople; and though he was involved in an accidental dispute with
Beric, the new ambassador of Attila, he flattered himself that he had
contributed, by the laborious journey, to confirm the peace and alliance
of the two nations.

</p>
<p>
A Latin poem, de prima expeditione Attilae, Regis Hunnorum, in Gallias,
was published in the year 1780, by Fischer at Leipsic. It contains,
with the continuation, 1452 lines. It abounds in metrical faults, but is
occasionally not without some rude spirit and some copiousness of fancy
in the variation of the circumstances in the different combats of the
hero Walther, prince of Aquitania. It contains little which can be
supposed historical, and still less which is characteristic concerning
Attila. It relates to a first expedition of Attila into Europe which
cannot be traced in history, during which the kings of the Franks, of
the Burgundians, and of Aquitaine, submit themselves, and give hostages
to Attila: the king of the Franks, a personage who seems the same
with the Hagen of Teutonic romance; the king of Burgundy, his daughter
Heldgund; the king of Aquitaine, his son Walther. The main subject of
the poem is the escape of Walther and Heldgund from the camp of Attila,
and the combat between Walther and Gunthar, king of the Franks. with his
twelve peers, among whom is Hagen. Walther had been betrayed while he
passed through Worms, the city of the Frankish king. by paying for his
ferry over the Rhine with some strange fish, which he had caught during
his flight, and which were unknown in the waters of the Rhine. Gunthar
was desirous of plundering him of the treasure, which Walther had
carried off from the camp of Attila. The author of this poem is unknown,
nor can I, on the vague and rather doubtful allusion to Thule, as
Iceland, venture to assign its date. It was, evidently, recited in a
monastery, as appears by the first line; and no doubt composed there.
The faults of metre would point out a late date; and it may have been
formed upon some local tradition, as Walther, the hero, seems to have
turned monk.
</p>
<p>
This poem, however, in its character and its incidents, bears no
relation to the Teutonic cycle, of which the Nibelungen Lied is the most
complete form. In this, in the Heldenbuch, in some of the Danish Sagas.
in countess lays and ballads in all the dialects of Scandinavia, appears
King Etzel (Attila) in strife with the Burgundians and the Franks. With
these appears, by a poetic anachronism, Dietrich of Berne. (Theodoric of
Verona,) the celebrated Ostrogothic king; and many other very singular
coincidences of historic names, which appear in the poems. (See Lachman
Kritik der Sage in his volume of various readings to the Nibelungen;
Berlin, 1836, p. 336.)

<h2>
    Chapter XXXIV: Attila.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
I must acknowledge myself unable to form any satisfactory theory as
to the connection of these poems with the history of the time, or the
period, from which they may date their origin; notwithstanding the
laborious investigations and critical sagacity of the Schlegels, the
Grimms, of P. E. Muller and Lachman, and a whole host of German critics
and antiquaries; not to omit our own countryman, Mr. Herbert, whose
theory concerning Attila is certainly neither deficient in boldness nor
originality. I conceive the only way to obtain any thing like a clear
conception on this point would be what Lachman has begun, (see above,)
patiently to collect and compare the various forms which the traditions
have assumed, without any preconceived, either mythical or poetical,
theory, and, if possible, to discover the original basis of the whole
rich and fantastic legend. One point, which to me is strongly in favor
of the antiquity of this poetic cycle, is, that the manners are so
clearly anterior to chivalry, and to the influence exercised on the
poetic literature of Europe by the chivalrous poems and romances. I
think I find some traces of that influence in the Latin poem, though
strained through the imagination of a monk. The English reader will find
an amusing account of the German Nibelungen and Heldenbuch, and of
some of the Scandinavian Sagas, in the volume of Northern Antiquities
published by Weber, the friend of Sir Walter Scott. Scott himself
contributed a considerable, no doubt far the most valuable, part to the
work. <a href="#note-4612" name="noteref-4612"><small>4612</small></a>

[ The curious narrative of this embassy, which required few
observations, and was not susceptible of any collateral evidence, may be
found in Priscus, p. 49-70. But I have not confined myself to the same
order; and I had previously extracted the historical circumstances,
which were less intimately connected with the journey, and business, of
the Roman ambassadors.]
</p>
<p>
But the Roman ambassador was ignorant of the treacherous design, which
had been concealed under the mask of the public faith. The surprise
and satisfaction of Edecon, when he contemplated the splendor of
Constantinople, had encouraged the interpreter Vigilius to procure for
him a secret interview with the eunuch Chrysaphius, <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> who governed
the emperor and the empire. After some previous conversation, and a
mutual oath of secrecy, the eunuch, who had not, from his own feelings
or experience, imbibed any exalted notions of ministerial virtue,
ventured to propose the death of Attila, as an important service, by
which Edecon might deserve a liberal share of the wealth and luxury
which he admired. The ambassador of the Huns listened to the tempting
offer; and professed, with apparent zeal, his ability, as well as
readiness, to execute the bloody deed; the design was communicated to
the master of the offices, and the devout Theodosius consented to the
assassination of his invincible enemy. But this perfidious conspiracy
was defeated by the dissimulation, or the repentance, of Edecon; and
though he might exaggerate his inward abhorrence for the treason, which
he seemed to approve, he dexterously assumed the merit of an early and
voluntary confession. If we now review the embassy of Maximin, and the
behavior of Attila, we must applaud the Barbarian, who respected the
laws of hospitality, and generously entertained and dismissed the
minister of a prince who had conspired against his life. But the
rashness of Vigilius will appear still more extraordinary, since
he returned, conscious of his guilt and danger, to the royal camp,
accompanied by his son, and carrying with him a weighty purse of gold,
which the favorite eunuch had furnished, to satisfy the demands of
Edecon, and to corrupt the fidelity of the guards. The interpreter was
instantly seized, and dragged before the tribunal of Attila, where
he asserted his innocence with specious firmness, till the threat
of inflicting instant death on his son extorted from him a sincere
discovery of the criminal transaction. Under the name of ransom, or
confiscation, the rapacious king of the Huns accepted two hundred pounds
of gold for the life of a traitor, whom he disdained to punish. He
pointed his just indignation against a nobler object. His ambassadors,
Eslaw and Orestes, were immediately despatched to Constantinople, with a
peremptory instruction, which it was much safer for them to execute than
to disobey. They boldly entered the Imperial presence, with the fatal
purse hanging down from the neck of Orestes; who interrogated the eunuch
Chrysaphius, as he stood beside the throne, whether he recognized the
evidence of his guilt. But the office of reproof was reserved for the
superior dignity of his colleague Eslaw, who gravely addressed the
emperor of the East in the following words: "Theodosius is the son of an
illustrious and respectable parent: Attila likewise is descended from a
noble race; and he has supported, by his actions, the dignity which
he inherited from his father Mundzuk. But Theodosius has forfeited his
paternal honors, and, by consenting to pay tribute has degraded himself
to the condition of a slave. It is therefore just, that he should
reverence the man whom fortune and merit have placed above him; instead
of attempting, like a wicked slave, clandestinely to conspire against
his master." The son of Arcadius, who was accustomed only to the voice
of flattery, heard with astonishment the severe language of truth: he
blushed and trembled; nor did he presume directly to refuse the head of
Chrysaphius, which Eslaw and Orestes were instructed to demand. A solemn
embassy, armed with full powers and magnificent gifts, was hastily sent
to deprecate the wrath of Attila; and his pride was gratified by the
choice of Nomius and Anatolius, two ministers of consular or
patrician rank, of whom the one was great treasurer, and the other was
master-general of the armies of the East. He condescended to meet these
ambassadors on the banks of the River Drenco; and though he at first
affected a stern and haughty demeanor, his anger was insensibly
mollified by their eloquence and liberality. He condescended to pardon
the emperor, the eunuch, and the interpreter; bound himself by an oath
to observe the conditions of peace; released a great number of captives;
abandoned the fugitives and deserters to their fate; and resigned
a large territory, to the south of the Danube, which he had already
exhausted of its wealth and inhabitants. But this treaty was purchased
at an expense which might have supported a vigorous and successful war;
and the subjects of Theodosius were compelled to redeem the safety of a
worthless favorite by oppressive taxes, which they would more cheerfully
have paid for his destruction. <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a>

[ M. de Tillemont has very properly given the succession of
chamberlains, who reigned in the name of Theodosius. Chrysaphius was the
last, and, according to the unanimous evidence of history, the worst
of these favorites, (see Hist. des Empereurs, tom. vi. p. 117-119.
Mem. Eccles. tom. xv. p. 438.) His partiality for his godfather the

by the death of Theodosius.]
</p>
<p>
The emperor Theodosius did not long survive the most humiliating
circumstance of an inglorious life. As he was riding, or hunting, in the
neighborhood of Constantinople, he was thrown from his horse into the
River Lycus: the spine of the back was injured by the fall; and he
expired some days afterwards, in the fiftieth year of his age, and the
forty-third of his reign. <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> His sister Pulcheria, whose authority
had been controlled both in civil and ecclesiastical affairs by the
pernicious influence of the eunuchs, was unanimously proclaimed Empress
of the East; and the Romans, for the first time, submitted to a female
reign. No sooner had Pulcheria ascended the throne, than she indulged
her own and the public resentment, by an act of popular justice. Without
any legal trial, the eunuch Chrysaphius was executed before the gates
of the city; and the immense riches which had been accumulated by the
rapacious favorite, served only to hasten and to justify his punishment.
<a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> Amidst the general acclamations of the clergy and people, the
empress did not forget the prejudice and disadvantage to which her sex
was exposed; and she wisely resolved to prevent their murmurs by the
choice of a colleague, who would always respect the superior rank and
virgin chastity of his wife. She gave her hand to Marcian, a senator,
about sixty years of age; and the nominal husband of Pulcheria was
solemnly invested with the Imperial purple. The zeal which he displayed
for the orthodox creed, as it was established by the council of
Chalcedon, would alone have inspired the grateful eloquence of the
Catholics. But the behavior of Marcian in a private life, and afterwards
on the throne, may support a more rational belief, that he was qualified
to restore and invigorate an empire, which had been almost dissolved
by the successive weakness of two hereditary monarchs. He was born in
Thrace, and educated to the profession of arms; but Marcian's youth
had been severely exercised by poverty and misfortune, since his only
resource, when he first arrived at Constantinople, consisted in two
hundred pieces of gold, which he had borrowed of a friend. He passed
nineteen years in the domestic and military service of Aspar, and his
son Ardaburius; followed those powerful generals to the Persian and
African wars; and obtained, by their influence, the honorable rank of
tribune and senator. His mild disposition, and useful talents, without
alarming the jealousy, recommended Marcian to the esteem and favor of
his patrons; he had seen, perhaps he had felt, the abuses of a venal and
oppressive administration; and his own example gave weight and energy to
the laws, which he promulgated for the reformation of manners. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a>
