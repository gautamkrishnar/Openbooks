</pre>
<p>
The loss or desolation of the provinces, from the Ocean to the Alps,
impaired the glory and greatness of Rome: her internal prosperity was
irretrievably destroyed by the separation of Africa. The rapacious
Vandals confiscated the patrimonial estates of the senators, and
intercepted the regular subsidies, which relieved the poverty and
encouraged the idleness of the plebeians. The distress of the Romans
was soon aggravated by an unexpected attack; and the province, so long
cultivated for their use by industrious and obedient subjects, was
armed against them by an ambitious Barbarian. The Vandals and Alani, who
followed the successful standard of Genseric, had acquired a rich and
fertile territory, which stretched along the coast above ninety days'
journey from Tangier to Tripoli; but their narrow limits were pressed
and confined, on either side, by the sandy desert and the Mediterranean.
The discovery and conquest of the Black nations, that might dwell
beneath the torrid zone, could not tempt the rational ambition of
Genseric; but he cast his eyes towards the sea; he resolved to create a
naval power, and his bold resolution was executed with steady and active
perseverance.
</p>
<p>
The woods of Mount Atlas afforded an inexhaustible nursery of
timber: his new subjects were skilled in the arts of navigation and
ship-building; he animated his daring Vandals to embrace a mode of
warfare which would render every maritime country accessible to their
arms; the Moors and Africans were allured by the hopes of plunder; and,
after an interval of six centuries, the fleets that issued from the port
of Carthage again claimed the empire of the Mediterranean. The success
of the Vandals, the conquest of Sicily, the sack of Palermo, and the
frequent descents on the coast of Lucania, awakened and alarmed the
mother of Valentinian, and the sister of Theodosius. Alliances were
formed; and armaments, expensive and ineffectual, were prepared, for the
destruction of the common enemy; who reserved his courage to encounter
those dangers which his policy could not prevent or elude. The designs
of the Roman government were repeatedly baffled by his artful delays,
ambiguous promises, and apparent concessions; and the interposition of
his formidable confederate, the king of the Huns, recalled the emperors
from the conquest of Africa to the care of their domestic safety. The
revolutions of the palace, which left the Western empire without a
defender, and without a lawful prince, dispelled the apprehensions, and
stimulated the avarice, of Genseric. He immediately equipped a numerous
fleet of Vandals and Moors, and cast anchor at the mouth of the Tyber,
about three months after the death of Valentinian, and the elevation of
Maximus to the Imperial throne.
</p>
<p>
The private life of the senator Petronius Maximus <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> was often
alleged as a rare example of human felicity. His birth was noble and
illustrious, since he descended from the Anician family; his dignity
was supported by an adequate patrimony in land and money; and these
advantages of fortune were accompanied with liberal arts and decent
manners, which adorn or imitate the inestimable gifts of genius and
virtue. The luxury of his palace and table was hospitable and elegant.
Whenever Maximus appeared in public, he was surrounded by a train of
grateful and obsequious clients; <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> and it is possible that among these
clients, he might deserve and possess some real friends. His merit was
rewarded by the favor of the prince and senate: he thrice exercised the
office of Praetorian praefect of Italy; he was twice invested with the
consulship, and he obtained the rank of patrician. These civil honors
were not incompatible with the enjoyment of leisure and tranquillity;
his hours, according to the demands of pleasure or reason, were
accurately distributed by a water-clock; and this avarice of time may
be allowed to prove the sense which Maximus entertained of his own
happiness. The injury which he received from the emperor Valentinian
appears to excuse the most bloody revenge. Yet a philosopher might have
reflected, that, if the resistance of his wife had been sincere, her
chastity was still inviolate, and that it could never be restored if
she had consented to the will of the adulterer. A patriot would
have hesitated before he plunged himself and his country into those
inevitable calamities which must follow the extinction of the royal
house of Theodosius. The imprudent Maximus disregarded these salutary
considerations; he gratified his resentment and ambition; he saw the
bleeding corpse of Valentinian at his feet; and he heard himself saluted
Emperor by the unanimous voice of the senate and people. But the day of
his inauguration was the last day of his happiness. He was imprisoned
(such is the lively expression of Sidonius) in the palace; and after
passing a sleepless night, he sighed that he had attained the summit of
his wishes, and aspired only to descend from the dangerous elevation.
Oppressed by the weight of the diadem, he communicated his anxious
thoughts to his friend and quaestor Fulgentius; and when he looked back
with unavailing regret on the secure pleasures of his former life, the
emperor exclaimed, "O fortunate Damocles, <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> thy reign began and
ended with the same dinner;" a well-known allusion, which Fulgentius
afterwards repeated as an instructive lesson for princes and subjects.

the second book, to refute the paradox of his friend Serranus, who
entertained a singular, though generous, enthusiasm for the deceased
emperor. This epistle, with some indulgence, may claim the praise of
an elegant composition; and it throws much light on the character of
Maximus.]

The reign of Maximus continued about three months. His hours, of which
he had lost the command, were disturbed by remorse, or guilt, or terror,
and his throne was shaken by the seditions of the soldiers, the people,
and the confederate Barbarians. The marriage of his son Paladius with
the eldest daughter of the late emperor, might tend to establish the
hereditary succession of his family; but the violence which he offered
to the empress Eudoxia, could proceed only from the blind impulse of
lust or revenge. His own wife, the cause of these tragic events, had
been seasonably removed by death; and the widow of Valentinian was
compelled to violate her decent mourning, perhaps her real grief, and to
submit to the embraces of a presumptuous usurper, whom she suspected
as the assassin of her deceased husband. These suspicions were soon
justified by the indiscreet confession of Maximus himself; and he
wantonly provoked the hatred of his reluctant bride, who was still
conscious that she was descended from a line of emperors. From the East,
however, Eudoxia could not hope to obtain any effectual assistance;
her father and her aunt Pulcheria were dead; her mother languished at
Jerusalem in disgrace and exile; and the sceptre of Constantinople was
in the hands of a stranger. She directed her eyes towards Carthage;
secretly implored the aid of the king of the Vandals; and persuaded
Genseric to improve the fair opportunity of disguising his rapacious
designs by the specious names of honor, justice, and compassion. <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a>
Whatever abilities Maximus might have shown in a subordinate station,
he was found incapable of administering an empire; and though he might
easily have been informed of the naval preparations which were made on
the opposite shores of Africa, he expected with supine indifference
the approach of the enemy, without adopting any measures of defence, of
negotiation, or of a timely retreat. When the Vandals disembarked at the
mouth of the Tyber, the emperor was suddenly roused from his lethargy
by the clamors of a trembling and exasperated multitude. The only hope
which presented itself to his astonished mind was that of a precipitate
flight, and he exhorted the senators to imitate the example of their
prince. But no sooner did Maximus appear in the streets, than he was
assaulted by a shower of stones; a Roman, or a Burgundian soldier,
claimed the honor of the first wound; his mangled body was ignominiously
cast into the Tyber; the Roman people rejoiced in the punishment which
they had inflicted on the author of the public calamities; and the
domestics of Eudoxia signalized their zeal in the service of their
mistress. <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a>

great truth, "Non si puo dir quanto sia facile il popolo a sognare e
spacciar voci false." But his argument, from the interval of time and
place, is extremely feeble. The figs which grew near Carthage were
produced to the senate of Rome on the third day.]

by their Burgundian mercenaries.]
</p>
<p>
On the third day after the tumult, Genseric boldly advanced from the
port of Ostia to the gates of the defenceless city. Instead of a sally
of the Roman youth, there issued from the gates an unarmed and venerable
procession of the bishop at the head of his clergy. <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> The fearless
spirit of Leo, his authority and eloquence, again mitigated the
fierceness of a Barbarian conqueror; the king of the Vandals promised to
spare the unresisting multitude, to protect the buildings from fire,
and to exempt the captives from torture; and although such orders were
neither seriously given, nor strictly obeyed, the mediation of Leo was
glorious to himself, and in some degree beneficial to his country. But
Rome and its inhabitants were delivered to the licentiousness of
the Vandals and Moors, whose blind passions revenged the injuries of
Carthage. The pillage lasted fourteen days and nights; and all that yet
remained of public or private wealth, of sacred or profane treasure, was
diligently transported to the vessels of Genseric. Among the spoils, the
splendid relics of two temples, or rather of two religions, exhibited a
memorable example of the vicissitudes of human and divine things.
</p>
<p>
Since the abolition of Paganism, the Capitol had been violated and
abandoned; yet the statues of the gods and heroes were still respected,
and the curious roof of gilt bronze was reserved for the rapacious hands
of Genseric. <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> The holy instruments of the Jewish worship, <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> the
gold table, and the gold candlestick with seven branches, originally
framed according to the particular instructions of God himself,
and which were placed in the sanctuary of his temple, had been
ostentatiously displayed to the Roman people in the triumph of Titus.
They were afterwards deposited in the temple of Peace; and at the end of
four hundred years, the spoils of Jerusalem were transferred from Rome
to Carthage, by a Barbarian who derived his origin from the shores
of the Baltic. These ancient monuments might attract the notice of
curiosity, as well as of avarice. But the Christian churches, enriched
and adorned by the prevailing superstition of the times, afforded more
plentiful materials for sacrilege; and the pious liberality of Pope Leo,
who melted six silver vases, the gift of Constantine, each of a hundred
pounds weight, is an evidence of the damage which he attempted to
repair. In the forty-five years that had elapsed since the Gothic
invasion, the pomp and luxury of Rome were in some measure restored;
and it was difficult either to escape, or to satisfy, the avarice of a
conqueror, who possessed leisure to collect, and ships to transport,
the wealth of the capital. The Imperial ornaments of the palace, the
magnificent furniture and wardrobe, the sideboards of massy plate, were
accumulated with disorderly rapine; the gold and silver amounted to
several thousand talents; yet even the brass and copper were laboriously
removed. Eudoxia herself, who advanced to meet her friend and deliverer,
soon bewailed the imprudence of her own conduct. She was rudely stripped
of her jewels; and the unfortunate empress, with her two daughters,
the only surviving remains of the great Theodosius, was compelled, as a
captive, to follow the haughty Vandal; who immediately hoisted sail, and
returned with a prosperous navigation to the port of Carthage. <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a>
Many thousand Romans of both sexes, chosen for some useful or agreeable
qualifications, reluctantly embarked on board the fleet of Genseric; and
their distress was aggravated by the unfeeling Barbarians, who, in the
division of the booty, separated the wives from their husbands, and
the children from their parents. The charity of Deogratias, bishop of
Carthage, <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> was their only consolation and support. He generously
sold the gold and silver plate of the church to purchase the freedom of
some, to alleviate the slavery of others, and to assist the wants and
infirmities of a captive multitude, whose health was impaired by the
hardships which they had suffered in their passage from Italy to Africa.
By his order, two spacious churches were converted into hospitals; the
sick were distributed into convenient beds, and liberally supplied with
food and medicines; and the aged prelate repeated his visits both in
the day and night, with an assiduity that surpassed his strength, and a
tender sympathy which enhanced the value of his services. Compare this
scene with the field of Cannae; and judge between Hannibal and the
successor of St. Cyprian. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a>

Liber Pontificalis.]

[ The profusion of Catulus, the first who gilt the roof of
the Capitol, was not universally approved, (Plin. Hist. Natur. xxxiii.
18;) but it was far exceeded by the emperor's, and the external
gilding of the temple cost Domitian 12,000 talents, (2,400,000 L.) The
expressions of Claudian and Rutilius (luce metalli oemula.... fastigia
astris, and confunduntque vagos delubra micantia visus) manifestly
prove, that this splendid covering was not removed either by the
Christians or the Goths, (see Donatus, Roma Antiqua, l. ii. c. 6, p.
125.) It should seem that the roof of the Capitol was decorated with
gilt statues, and chariots drawn by four horses.]

Reb. Geticis, c. 45, p. 677,) and the Chronicles of Idatius, Prosper,

</p>
<p>
The deaths of Aetius and Valentinian had relaxed the ties which held
the Barbarians of Gaul in peace and subordination. The sea-coast was
infested by the Saxons; the Alemanni and the Franks advanced from the
Rhine to the Seine; and the ambition of the Goths seemed to meditate
more extensive and permanent conquests. The emperor Maximus relieved
himself, by a judicious choice, from the weight of these distant cares;
he silenced the solicitations of his friends, listened to the voice of
fame, and promoted a stranger to the general command of the forces of
Gaul.
</p>
<p>
Avitus, <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> the stranger, whose merit was so nobly rewarded, descended
from a wealthy and honorable family in the diocese of Auvergne. The
convulsions of the times urged him to embrace, with the same ardor, the
civil and military professions: and the indefatigable youth blended the
studies of literature and jurisprudence with the exercise of arms and
hunting. Thirty years of his life were laudably spent in the public
service; he alternately displayed his talents in war and negotiation;
and the soldier of Aetius, after executing the most important embassies,
was raised to the station of Praetorian praefect of Gaul. Either the
merit of Avitus excited envy, or his moderation was desirous of
repose, since he calmly retired to an estate, which he possessed in the
neighborhood of Clermont. A copious stream, issuing from the mountain,
and falling headlong in many a loud and foaming cascade, discharged
its waters into a lake about two miles in length, and the villa was
pleasantly seated on the margin of the lake. The baths, the porticos,
the summer and winter apartments, were adapted to the purposes of luxury
and use; and the adjacent country afforded the various prospects of
woods, pastures, and meodows. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> In this retreat, where Avitus amused
his leisure with books, rural sports, the practice of husbandry, and
the society of his friends, <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> he received the Imperial diploma, which
constituted him master-general of the cavalry and infantry of Gaul. He
assumed the military command; the Barbarians suspended their fury; and
whatever means he might employ, whatever concessions he might be forced
to make, the people enjoyed the benefits of actual tranquillity. But
the fate of Gaul depended on the Visigoths; and the Roman general, less
attentive to his dignity than to the public interest, did not disdain to
visit Thoulouse in the character of an ambassador. He was received with
courteous hospitality by Theodoric, the king of the Goths; but while
Avitus laid the foundations of a solid alliance with that powerful
nation, he was astonished by the intelligence, that the emperor Maximus
was slain, and that Rome had been pillaged by the Vandals. A vacant
throne, which he might ascend without guilt or danger, tempted his
ambition; <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> and the Visigoths were easily persuaded to support his
claim by their irresistible suffrage. They loved the person of Avitus;
they respected his virtues; and they were not insensible of the
advantage, as well as honor, of giving an emperor to the West. The
season was now approaching, in which the annual assembly of the seven
provinces was held at Arles; their deliberations might perhaps be
influenced by the presence of Theodoric and his martial brothers; but
their choice would naturally incline to the most illustrious of their
countrymen. Avitus, after a decent resistance, accepted the Imperial
diadem from the representatives of Gaul; and his election was ratified
by the acclamations of the Barbarians and provincials. The formal
consent of Marcian, emperor of the East, was solicited and obtained; but
the senate, Rome, and Italy, though humbled by their recent calamities,
submitted with a secret murmur to the presumption of the Gallic usurper.

furnished with Latin authors, profane and religious; the former for the
men, the latter for the ladies. The table was twice served, at dinner

Theodoric, to whom Avitus was indebted for the purple, had acquired

might not be incompatible with the virtues of a Barbarian; but
the manners of Theodoric were gentle and humane; and posterity may
contemplate without terror the original picture of a Gothic king, whom
Sidonius had intimately observed, in the hours of peace and of social
intercourse. In an epistle, dated from the court of Thoulouse, the
orator satisfies the curiosity of one of his friends, in the following
description: <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> "By the majesty of his appearance, Theodoric would
command the respect of those who are ignorant of his merit; and although
he is born a prince, his merit would dignify a private station. He is
of a middle stature, his body appears rather plump than fat, and in his
well-proportioned limbs agility is united with muscular strength. <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a>
If you examine his countenance, you will distinguish a high forehead,
large shaggy eyebrows, an aquiline nose, thin lips, a regular set of
white teeth, and a fair complexion, that blushes more frequently from
modesty than from anger. The ordinary distribution of his time, as
far as it is exposed to the public view, may be concisely represented.
Before daybreak, he repairs, with a small train, to his domestic chapel,
where the service is performed by the Arian clergy; but those who
presume to interpret his secret sentiments, consider this assiduous
devotion as the effect of habit and policy. The rest of the morning is
employed in the administration of his kingdom. His chair is surrounded
by some military officers of decent aspect and behavior: the noisy crowd
of his Barbarian guards occupies the hall of audience; but they are
not permitted to stand within the veils or curtains that conceal the
council-chamber from vulgar eyes. The ambassadors of the nations are
successively introduced: Theodoric listens with attention, answers them
with discreet brevity, and either announces or delays, according to the
nature of their business, his final resolution. About eight (the second
hour) he rises from his throne, and visits either his treasury or his
stables. If he chooses to hunt, or at least to exercise himself on
horseback, his bow is carried by a favorite youth; but when the game is
marked, he bends it with his own hand, and seldom misses the object of
his aim: as a king, he disdains to bear arms in such ignoble warfare;
but as a soldier, he would blush to accept any military service which he
could perform himself. On common days, his dinner is not different from
the repast of a private citizen, but every Saturday, many honorable
guests are invited to the royal table, which, on these occasions, is
served with the elegance of Greece, the plenty of Gaul, and the order
and diligence of Italy. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> The gold or silver plate is less remarkable
for its weight than for the brightness and curious workmanship: the
taste is gratified without the help of foreign and costly luxury; the
size and number of the cups of wine are regulated with a strict regard
to the laws of temperance; and the respectful silence that prevails, is
interrupted only by grave and instructive conversation. After dinner,
Theodoric sometimes indulges himself in a short slumber; and as soon as
he wakes, he calls for the dice and tables, encourages his friends to
forget the royal majesty, and is delighted when they freely express the
passions which are excited by the incidents of play. At this game, which
he loves as the image of war, he alternately displays his eagerness, his
skill, his patience, and his cheerful temper. If he loses, he laughs;
he is modest and silent if he wins. Yet, notwithstanding this seeming
indifference, his courtiers choose to solicit any favor in the moments
of victory; and I myself, in my applications to the king, have derived
some benefit from my losses. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> About the ninth hour (three o'clock)
the tide of business again returns, and flows incessantly till after
sunset, when the signal of the royal supper dismisses the weary crowd of
suppliants and pleaders. At the supper, a more familiar repast, buffoons
and pantomimes are sometimes introduced, to divert, not to offend, the
company, by their ridiculous wit: but female singers, and the soft,
effeminate modes of music, are severely banished, and such martial tunes
as animate the soul to deeds of valor are alone grateful to the ear
of Theodoric. He retires from table; and the nocturnal guards are
immediately posted at the entrance of the treasury, the palace, and the
private apartments."

When the king of the Visigoths encouraged Avitus to assume the purple,
he offered his person and his forces, as a faithful soldier of the
republic. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> The exploits of Theodoric soon convinced the world that
he had not degenerated from the warlike virtues of his ancestors. After
the establishment of the Goths in Aquitain, and the passage of the
Vandals into Africa, the Suevi, who had fixed their kingdom in Gallicia,
aspired to the conquest of Spain, and threatened to extinguish the
feeble remains of the Roman dominion. The provincials of Carthagena and
Tarragona, afflicted by a hostile invasion, represented their injuries
and their apprehensions. Count Fronto was despatched, in the name of
the emperor Avitus, with advantageous offers of peace and alliance; and
Theodoric interposed his weighty mediation, to declare, that, unless his
brother-in-law, the king of the Suevi, immediately retired, he should be
obliged to arm in the cause of justice and of Rome. "Tell him," replied
the haughty Rechiarius, "that I despise his friendship and his arms; but
that I shall soon try whether he will dare to expect my arrival under
the walls of Thoulouse." Such a challenge urged Theodoric to prevent
the bold designs of his enemy; he passed the Pyrenees at the head of
the Visigoths: the Franks and Burgundians served under his standard; and
though he professed himself the dutiful servant of Avitus, he privately
stipulated, for himself and his successors, the absolute possession
of his Spanish conquests. The two armies, or rather the two nations,
encountered each other on the banks of the River Urbicus, about twelve
miles from Astorga; and the decisive victory of the Goths appeared for
a while to have extirpated the name and kingdom of the Suevi. From the
field of battle Theodoric advanced to Braga, their metropolis, which
still retained the splendid vestiges of its ancient commerce and
dignity. <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> His entrance was not polluted with blood; and the Goths
respected the chastity of their female captives, more especially of the
consecrated virgins: but the greatest part of the clergy and people were
made slaves, and even the churches and altars were confounded in the
universal pillage. The unfortunate king of the Suevi had escaped to one
of the ports of the ocean; but the obstinacy of the winds opposed his
flight: he was delivered to his implacable rival; and Rechiarius, who
neither desired nor expected mercy, received, with manly constancy,
the death which he would probably have inflicted. After this bloody
sacrifice to policy or resentment, Theodoric carried his victorious arms
as far as Merida, the principal town of Lusitania, without meeting any
resistance, except from the miraculous powers of St. Eulalia; but he was
stopped in the full career of success, and recalled from Spain before he
could provide for the security of his conquests. In his retreat towards
the Pyrenees, he revenged his disappointment on the country through
which he passed; and, in the sack of Pollentia and Astorga, he showed
himself a faithless ally, as well as a cruel enemy. Whilst the king of
the Visigoths fought and vanquished in the name of Avitus, the reign
of Avitus had expired; and both the honor and the interest of Theodoric
were deeply wounded by the disgrace of a friend, whom he had seated on
the throne of the Western empire. <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
The pressing solicitations of the senate and people persuaded the
emperor Avitus to fix his residence at Rome, and to accept the
consulship for the ensuing year. On the first day of January, his
son-in-law, Sidonius Apollinaris, celebrated his praises in a panegyric
of six hundred verses; but this composition, though it was rewarded with
a brass statue, <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> seems to contain a very moderate proportion, either
of genius or of truth. The poet, if we may degrade that sacred name,
exaggerates the merit of a sovereign and a father; and his prophecy of a
long and glorious reign was soon contradicted by the event. Avitus, at a
time when the Imperial dignity was reduced to a preeminence of toil and
danger, indulged himself in the pleasures of Italian luxury: age had not
extinguished his amorous inclinations; and he is accused of insulting,
with indiscreet and ungenerous raillery, the husbands whose wives he
had seduced or violated. <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> But the Romans were not inclined either
to excuse his faults or to acknowledge his virtues. The several parts
of the empire became every day more alienated from each other; and the
stranger of Gaul was the object of popular hatred and contempt. The
senate asserted their legitimate claim in the election of an emperor;
and their authority, which had been originally derived from the old
constitution, was again fortified by the actual weakness of a declining
monarchy. Yet even such a monarchy might have resisted the votes of an
unarmed senate, if their discontent had not been supported, or perhaps
inflamed, by the Count Ricimer, one of the principal commanders of the
Barbarian troops, who formed the military defence of Italy. The daughter
of Wallia, king of the Visigoths, was the mother of Ricimer; but he was
descended, on the father's side, from the nation of the Suevi; <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a>
his pride or patriotism might be exasperated by the misfortunes of
his countrymen; and he obeyed, with reluctance, an emperor in whose
elevation he had not been consulted. His faithful and important services
against the common enemy rendered him still more formidable; <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> and,
after destroying on the coast of Corsica a fleet of Vandals, which
consisted of sixty galleys, Ricimer returned in triumph with the
appellation of the Deliverer of Italy. He chose that moment to signify
to Avitus, that his reign was at an end; and the feeble emperor, at
a distance from his Gothic allies, was compelled, after a short and
unavailing struggle to abdicate the purple. By the clemency, however,
or the contempt, of Ricimer, <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> he was permitted to descend from the
throne to the more desirable station of bishop of Placentia: but the
resentment of the senate was still unsatisfied; and their inflexible
severity pronounced the sentence of his death He fled towards the Alps,
with the humble hope, not of arming the Visigoths in his cause, but of
securing his person and treasures in the sanctuary of Julian, one of
the tutelar saints of Auvergne. <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> Disease, or the hand of the
executioner, arrested him on the road; yet his remains were decently
transported to Brivas, or Brioude, in his native province, and he
reposed at the feet of his holy patron. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> Avitus left only one
daughter, the wife of Sidonius Apollinaris, who inherited the patrimony
of his father-in-law; lamenting, at the same time, the disappointment
of his public and private expectations. His resentment prompted him to
join, or at least to countenance, the measures of a rebellious faction
in Gaul; and the poet had contracted some guilt, which it was incumbent
on him to expiate, by a new tribute of flattery to the succeeding
emperor. <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a>

The successor of Avitus presents the welcome discovery of a great and
heroic character, such as sometimes arise, in a degenerate age, to
vindicate the honor of the human species. The emperor Majorian has
deserved the praises of his contemporaries, and of posterity; and
these praises may be strongly expressed in the words of a judicious and
disinterested historian: "That he was gentle to his subjects; that he
was terrible to his enemies; and that he excelled, in every virtue, all
his predecessors who had reigned over the Romans." <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> Such a testimony
may justify at least the panegyric of S donius; and we may acquiesce
in the assurance, that, although the obsequious orator would have
flattered, with equal zeal, the most worthless of princes, the
extraordinary merit of his object confined him, on this occasion, within
the bounds of truth. <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> Majorian derived his name from his maternal
grandfather, who, in the reign of the great Theodosius, had commanded
the troops of the Illyrian frontier. He gave his daughter in marriage
to the father of Majorian, a respectable officer, who administered the
revenues of Gaul with skill and integrity; and generously preferred the
friendship of Aetius to the tempting offer of an insidious court. His
son, the future emperor, who was educated in the profession of arms,
displayed, from his early youth, intrepid courage, premature wisdom, and
unbounded liberality in a scanty fortune. He followed the standard of
Aetius, contributed to his success, shared, and sometimes eclipsed, his
glory, and at last excited the jealousy of the patrician, or rather
of his wife, who forced him to retire from the service. <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> Majorian,
after the death of Aetius, was recalled and promoted; and his intimate
connection with Count Ricimer was the immediate step by which he
ascended the throne of the Western empire. During the vacancy that
succeeded the abdication of Avitus, the ambitious Barbarian, whose birth
excluded him from the Imperial dignity, governed Italy with the title
of Patrician; resigned to his friend the conspicuous station of
master-general of the cavalry and infantry; and, after an interval of
some months, consented to the unanimous wish of the Romans, whose favor
Majorian had solicited by a recent victory over the Alemanni. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a>
He was invested with the purple at Ravenna: and the epistle which
he addressed to the senate, will best describe his situation and his
sentiments. "Your election, Conscript Fathers! and the ordinance of the
most valiant army, have made me your emperor. <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> May the propitious
Deity direct and prosper the counsels and events of my administration,
to your advantage and to the public welfare! For my own part, I did
not aspire, I have submitted to reign; nor should I have discharged
the obligations of a citizen if I had refused, with base and selfish
ingratitude, to support the weight of those labors, which were imposed
by the republic. Assist, therefore, the prince whom you have made;
partake the duties which you have enjoined; and may our common endeavors
promote the happiness of an empire, which I have accepted from your
hands. Be assured, that, in our times, justice shall resume her ancient
vigor, and that virtue shall become, not only innocent, but meritorious.
Let none, except the authors themselves, be apprehensive of delations,
<a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> which, as a subject, I have always condemned, and, as a prince,
will severely punish. Our own vigilance, and that of our father, the
patrician Ricimer, shall regulate all military affairs, and provide
for the safety of the Roman world, which we have saved from foreign and
domestic enemies. <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> You now understand the maxims of my government;
you may confide in the faithful love and sincere assurances of a prince
who has formerly been the companion of your life and dangers; who still
glories in the name of senator, and who is anxious that you should
never repent the judgment which you have pronounced in his favor." The
emperor, who, amidst the ruins of the Roman world, revived the ancient
language of law and liberty, which Trajan would not have disclaimed,
must have derived those generous sentiments from his own heart; since
they were not suggested to his imitation by the customs of his age, or
the example of his predecessors. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The private and public actions of Majorian are very imperfectly known:
but his laws, remarkable for an original cast of thought and expression,
faithfully represent the character of a sovereign who loved his people,
who sympathized in their distress, who had studied the causes of the
decline of the empire, and who was capable of applying (as far as such
reformation was practicable) judicious and effectual remedies to
the public disorders. <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> His regulations concerning the finances
manifestly tended to remove, or at least to mitigate, the most
intolerable grievances. I. From the first hour of his reign, he was
solicitous (I translate his own words) to relieve the weary fortunes of
the provincials, oppressed by the accumulated weight of indictions and
superindictions. <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> With this view he granted a universal amnesty, a
final and absolute discharge of all arrears of tribute, of all debts,
which, under any pretence, the fiscal officers might demand from the
people. This wise dereliction of obsolete, vexatious, and unprofitable
claims, improved and purified the sources of the public revenue; and the
subject who could now look back without despair, might labor with hope
and gratitude for himself and for his country. II. In the assessment and
collection of taxes, Majorian restored the ordinary jurisdiction of the
provincial magistrates; and suppressed the extraordinary commissions
which had been introduced, in the name of the emperor himself, or of the
Praetorian praefects. The favorite servants, who obtained such irregular
powers, were insolent in their behavior, and arbitrary in their demands:
they affected to despise the subordinate tribunals, and they were
discontented, if their fees and profits did not twice exceed the sum
which they condescended to pay into the treasury. One instance of their
extortion would appear incredible, were it not authenticated by the
legislator himself. They exacted the whole payment in gold: but they
refused the current coin of the empire, and would accept only such
ancient pieces as were stamped with the names of Faustina or the
Antonines. The subject, who was unprovided with these curious medals,
had recourse to the expedient of compounding with their rapacious
demands; or if he succeeded in the research, his imposition was doubled,
according to the weight and value of the money of former times. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a>
III. "The municipal corporations, (says the emperor,) the lesser
senates, (so antiquity has justly styled them,) deserve to be considered
as the heart of the cities, and the sinews of the republic. And yet
so low are they now reduced, by the injustice of magistrates and the
venality of collectors, that many of their members, renouncing their
dignity and their country, have taken refuge in distant and obscure
exile." He urges, and even compels, their return to their respective
cities; but he removes the grievance which had forced them to desert
the exercise of their municipal functions. They are directed, under
the authority of the provincial magistrates, to resume their office
of levying the tribute; but, instead of being made responsible for the
whole sum assessed on their district, they are only required to produce
a regular account of the payments which they have actually received, and
of the defaulters who are still indebted to the public. IV. But Majorian
was not ignorant that these corporate bodies were too much inclined to
retaliate the injustice and oppression which they had suffered; and
he therefore revives the useful office of the defenders of cities. He
exhorts the people to elect, in a full and free assembly, some man of
discretion and integrity, who would dare to assert their privileges, to
represent their grievances, to protect the poor from the tyranny of the
rich, and to inform the emperor of the abuses that were committed under
the sanction of his name and authority.

The spectator who casts a mournful view over the ruins of
ancient Rome, is tempted to accuse the memory of the Goths and Vandals,
for the mischief which they had neither leisure, nor power, nor perhaps
inclination, to perpetrate. The tempest of war might strike some
lofty turrets to the ground; but the destruction which undermined the
foundations of those massy fabrics was prosecuted, slowly and silently,
during a period of ten centuries; and the motives of interest, that
afterwards operated without shame or control, were severely checked by
the taste and spirit of the emperor Majorian. The decay of the city
had gradually impaired the value of the public works. The circus and
theatres might still excite, but they seldom gratified, the desires of
the people: the temples, which had escaped the zeal of the Christians,
were no longer inhabited, either by gods or men; the diminished
crowds of the Romans were lost in the immense space of their baths and
porticos; and the stately libraries and halls of justice became useless
to an indolent generation, whose repose was seldom disturbed, either
by study or business. The monuments of consular, or Imperial, greatness
were no longer revered, as the immortal glory of the capital: they were
only esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of materials, cheaper, and more
convenient than the distant quarry. Specious petitions were continually
addressed to the easy magistrates of Rome, which stated the want of
stones or bricks, for some necessary service: the fairest forms of
architecture were rudely defaced, for the sake of some paltry, or
pretended, repairs; and the degenerate Romans, who converted the spoil
to their own emolument, demolished, with sacrilegious hands, the labors
of their ancestors. Majorian, who had often sighed over the desolation
of the city, applied a severe remedy to the growing evil. <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> He
reserved to the prince and senate the sole cognizance of the extreme
cases which might justify the destruction of an ancient edifice; imposed
a fine of fifty pounds of gold (two thousand pounds sterling) on every
magistrate who should presume to grant such illegal and scandalous
license, and threatened to chastise the criminal obedience of their
subordinate officers, by a severe whipping, and the amputation of both
their hands. In the last instance, the legislator might seem to forget
the proportion of guilt and punishment; but his zeal arose from a
generous principle, and Majorian was anxious to protect the monuments
of those ages, in which he would have desired and deserved to live. The
emperor conceived, that it was his interest to increase the number
of his subjects; and that it was his duty to guard the purity of the
marriage-bed: but the means which he employed to accomplish these
salutary purposes are of an ambiguous, and perhaps exceptionable,
kind. The pious maids, who consecrated their virginity to Christ, were
restrained from taking the veil till they had reached their fortieth
year. Widows under that age were compelled to form a second alliance
within the term of five years, by the forfeiture of half their wealth
to their nearest relations, or to the state. Unequal marriages were
condemned or annulled. The punishment of confiscation and exile was
deemed so inadequate to the guilt of adultery, that, if the criminal
returned to Italy, he might, by the express declaration of Majorian, be
slain with impunity. <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a>

<p>
While the emperor Majorian assiduously labored to restore the happiness
and virtue of the Romans, he encountered the arms of Genseric, from his
character and situation their most formidable enemy. A fleet of Vandals
and Moors landed at the mouth of the Liris, or Garigliano; but the
Imperial troops surprised and attacked the disorderly Barbarians, who
were encumbered with the spoils of Campania; they were chased with
slaughter to their ships, and their leader, the king's brother-in-law,
was found in the number of the slain. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> Such vigilance might announce
the character of the new reign; but the strictest vigilance, and the
most numerous forces, were insufficient to protect the long-extended
coast of Italy from the depredations of a naval war. The public opinion
had imposed a nobler and more arduous task on the genius of Majorian.
Rome expected from him alone the restitution of Africa; and the design,
which he formed, of attacking the Vandals in their new settlements, was
the result of bold and judicious policy. If the intrepid emperor could
have infused his own spirit into the youth of Italy; if he could have
revived in the field of Mars, the manly exercises in which he had always
surpassed his equals; he might have marched against Genseric at the
head of a Roman army. Such a reformation of national manners might be
embraced by the rising generation; but it is the misfortune of those
princes who laboriously sustain a declining monarchy, that, to obtain
some immediate advantage, or to avert some impending danger, they are
forced to countenance, and even to multiply, the most pernicious abuses.
Majorian, like the weakest of his predecessors, was reduced to the
disgraceful expedient of substituting Barbarian auxiliaries in the place
of his unwarlike subjects: and his superior abilities could only be
displayed in the vigor and dexterity with which he wielded a dangerous
instrument, so apt to recoil on the hand that used it. Besides the
confederates, who were already engaged in the service of the empire, the
fame of his liberality and valor attracted the nations of the Danube,
the Borysthenes, and perhaps of the Tanais. Many thousands of the
bravest subjects of Attila, the Gepidae, the Ostrogoths, the Rugians,
the Burgundians, the Suevi, the Alani, assembled in the plains of
Liguria; and their formidable strength was balanced by their mutual
animosities. <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> They passed the Alps in a severe winter. The emperor
led the way, on foot, and in complete armor; sounding, with his long
staff, the depth of the ice, or snow, and encouraging the Scythians,
who complained of the extreme cold, by the cheerful assurance, that they
should be satisfied with the heat of Africa. The citizens of Lyons had
presumed to shut their gates; they soon implored, and experienced, the
clemency of Majorian. He vanquished Theodoric in the field; and admitted
to his friendship and alliance a king whom he had found not unworthy of
his arms. The beneficial, though precarious, reunion of the greater part
of Gaul and Spain, was the effect of persuasion, as well as of force;
<a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> and the independent Bagaudae, who had escaped, or resisted, the
oppression, of former reigns, were disposed to confide in the virtues
of Majorian. His camp was filled with Barbarian allies; his throne was
supported by the zeal of an affectionate people; but the emperor had
foreseen, that it was impossible, without a maritime power, to achieve
the conquest of Africa. In the first Punic war, the republic had exerted
such incredible diligence, that, within sixty days after the first
stroke of the axe had been given in the forest, a fleet of one hundred
and sixty galleys proudly rode at anchor in the sea. <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> Under
circumstances much less favorable, Majorian equalled the spirit and
perseverance of the ancient Romans. The woods of the Apennine were
felled; the arsenals and manufactures of Ravenna and Misenum were
restored; Italy and Gaul vied with each other in liberal contributions
to the public service; and the Imperial navy of three hundred large
galleys, with an adequate proportion of transports and smaller vessels,
was collected in the secure and capacious harbor of Carthagena in Spain.
<a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> The intrepid countenance of Majorian animated his troops with a
confidence of victory; and, if we might credit the historian Procopius,
his courage sometimes hurried him beyond the bounds of prudence. Anxious
to explore, with his own eyes, the state of the Vandals, he ventured,
after disguising the color of his hair, to visit Carthage, in the
character of his own ambassador: and Genseric was afterwards mortified
by the discovery, that he had entertained and dismissed the emperor of
the Romans. Such an anecdote may be rejected as an improbable fiction;
but it is a fiction which would not have been imagined, unless in the
life of a hero. <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
Without the help of a personal interview, Genseric was sufficiently
acquainted with the genius and designs of his adversary. He practiced
his customary arts of fraud and delay, but he practiced them without
success. His applications for peace became each hour more submissive,
and perhaps more sincere; but the inflexible Majorian had adopted the
ancient maxim, that Rome could not be safe, as long as Carthage existed
in a hostile state. The king of the Vandals distrusted the valor of his
native subjects, who were enervated by the luxury of the South; <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> he
suspected the fidelity of the vanquished people, who abhorred him as an
Arian tyrant; and the desperate measure, which he executed, of reducing
Mauritania into a desert, <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> could not defeat the operations of the
Roman emperor, who was at liberty to land his troops on any part of the
African coast. But Genseric was saved from impending and inevitable ruin
by the treachery of some powerful subjects, envious, or apprehensive,
of their master's success. Guided by their secret intelligence, he
surprised the unguarded fleet in the Bay of Carthagena: many of the
ships were sunk, or taken, or burnt; and the preparations of three years
were destroyed in a single day. <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> After this event, the behavior of
the two antagonists showed them superior to their fortune. The Vandal,
instead of being elated by this accidental victory, immediately renewed
his solicitations for peace. The emperor of the West, who was capable
of forming great designs, and of supporting heavy disappointments,
consented to a treaty, or rather to a suspension of arms; in the full
assurance that, before he could restore his navy, he should be supplied
with provocations to justify a second war. Majorian returned to Italy,
to prosecute his labors for the public happiness; and, as he was
conscious of his own integrity, he might long remain ignorant of the
dark conspiracy which threatened his throne and his life. The recent
misfortune of Carthagena sullied the glory which had dazzled the eyes of
the multitude; almost every description of civil and military officers
were exasperated against the Reformer, since they all derived some
advantage from the abuses which he endeavored to suppress; and the
patrician Ricimer impelled the inconstant passions of the Barbarians
against a prince whom he esteemed and hated. The virtues of Majorian
could not protect him from the impetuous sedition, which broke out in
the camp near Tortona, at the foot of the Alps. He was compelled to
abdicate the Imperial purple: five days after his abdication, it was
reported that he died of a dysentery; <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> and the humble tomb, which
covered his remains, was consecrated by the respect and gratitude of
succeeding generations. <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> The private character of Majorian inspired
love and respect. Malicious calumny and satire excited his indignation,
or, if he himself were the object, his contempt; but he protected the
freedom of wit, and, in the hours which the emperor gave to the familiar
society of his friends, he could indulge his taste for pleasantry,
without degrading the majesty of his rank. <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a>

</p>
<p>
It was not, perhaps, without some regret, that Ricimer sacrificed his
friend to the interest of his ambition: but he resolved, in a second
choice, to avoid the imprudent preference of superior virtue and merit.
At his command, the obsequious senate of Rome bestowed the Imperial
title on Libius Severus, who ascended the throne of the West without
emerging from the obscurity of a private condition. History has scarcely
deigned to notice his birth, his elevation, his character, or his death.
Severus expired, as soon as his life became inconvenient to his patron;
<a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> and it would be useless to discriminate his nominal reign in the
vacant interval of six years, between the death of Majorian and the
elevation of Anthemius. During that period, the government was in the
hands of Ricimer alone; and, although the modest Barbarian disclaimed
the name of king, he accumulated treasures, formed a separate army,
negotiated private alliances, and ruled Italy with the same independent
and despotic authority, which was afterwards exercised by Odoacer and
Theodoric. But his dominions were bounded by the Alps; and two Roman
generals, Marcellinus and Aegidius, maintained their allegiance to the
republic, by rejecting, with disdain, the phantom which he styled an
emperor. Marcellinus still adhered to the old religion; and the devout
Pagans, who secretly disobeyed the laws of the church and state,
applauded his profound skill in the science of divination. But he
possessed the more valuable qualifications of learning, virtue, and
courage; <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> the study of the Latin literature had improved his
taste; and his military talents had recommended him to the esteem and
confidence of the great Aetius, in whose ruin he was involved. By a
timely flight, Marcellinus escaped the rage of Valentinian, and boldly
asserted his liberty amidst the convulsions of the Western empire. His
voluntary, or reluctant, submission to the authority of Majorian,
was rewarded by the government of Sicily, and the command of an army,
stationed in that island to oppose, or to attack, the Vandals; but his
Barbarian mercenaries, after the emperor's death, were tempted to revolt
by the artful liberality of Ricimer. At the head of a band of faithful
followers, the intrepid Marcellinus occupied the province of Dalmatia,
assumed the title of patrician of the West, secured the love of his
subjects by a mild and equitable reign, built a fleet which claimed the
dominion of the Adriatic, and alternately alarmed the coasts of Italy
and of Africa. <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> Aegidius, the master-general of Gaul, who equalled,
or at least who imitated, the heroes of ancient Rome, <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> proclaimed
his immortal resentment against the assassins of his beloved master. A
brave and numerous army was attached to his standard: and, though he was
prevented by the arts of Ricimer, and the arms of the Visigoths, from
marching to the gates of Rome, he maintained his independent sovereignty
beyond the Alps, and rendered the name of Aegidius, respectable both
in peace and war. The Franks, who had punished with exile the youthful
follies of Childeric, elected the Roman general for their king: his
vanity, rather than his ambition, was gratified by that singular honor;
and when the nation, at the end of four years, repented of the
injury which they had offered to the Merovingian family, he patiently
acquiesced in the restoration of the lawful prince. The authority of
Aegidius ended only with his life, and the suspicions of poison and
secret violence, which derived some countenance from the character of
Ricimer, were eagerly entertained by the passionate credulity of the
Gauls. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a>

<p>
The kingdom of Italy, a name to which the Western empire was gradually
reduced, was afflicted, under the reign of Ricimer, by the incessant
depredations of the Vandal pirates. <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> In the spring of each year,
they equipped a formidable navy in the port of Carthage; and Genseric
himself, though in a very advanced age, still commanded in person the
most important expeditions. His designs were concealed with impenetrable
secrecy, till the moment that he hoisted sail. When he was asked, by
his pilot, what course he should steer, "Leave the determination to
the winds, (replied the Barbarian, with pious arrogance;) they will
transport us to the guilty coast, whose inhabitants have provoked the
divine justice;" but if Genseric himself deigned to issue more precise
orders, he judged the most wealthy to be the most criminal. The Vandals
repeatedly visited the coasts of Spain, Liguria, Tuscany, Campania,
Lucania, Bruttium, Apulia, Calabria, Venetia, Dalmatia, Epirus, Greece,
and Sicily: they were tempted to subdue the Island of Sardinia, so
advantageously placed in the centre of the Mediterranean; and their arms
spread desolation, or terror, from the columns of Hercules to the mouth
of the Nile. As they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory, they
seldom attacked any fortified cities, or engaged any regular troops in
the open field. But the celerity of their motions enabled them, almost
at the same time, to threaten and to attack the most distant objects,
which attracted their desires; and as they always embarked a sufficient
number of horses, they had no sooner landed, than they swept the
dismayed country with a body of light cavalry. Yet, notwithstanding the
example of their king, the native Vandals and Alani insensibly declined
this toilsome and perilous warfare; the hardy generation of the first
conquerors was almost extinguished, and their sons, who were born in
Africa, enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired
by the valor of their fathers. Their place was readily supplied by a
various multitude of Moors and Romans, of captives and outlaws; and
those desperate wretches, who had already violated the laws of their
country, were the most eager to promote the atrocious acts which
disgrace the victories of Genseric. In the treatment of his unhappy
prisoners, he sometimes consulted his avarice, and sometimes indulged
his cruelty; and the massacre of five hundred noble citizens of Zant
or Zacynthus, whose mangled bodies he cast into the Ionian Sea, was
imputed, by the public indignation, to his latest posterity.

</pre>
<p>
Such crimes could not be excused by any provocations; but the war,
which the king of the Vandals prosecuted against the Roman empire was
justified by a specious and reasonable motive. The widow of Valentinian,
Eudoxia, whom he had led captive from Rome to Carthage, was the sole
heiress of the Theodosian house; her elder daughter, Eudocia, became
the reluctant wife of Hunneric, his eldest son; and the stern father,
asserting a legal claim, which could not easily be refuted or satisfied,
demanded a just proportion of the Imperial patrimony. An adequate, or at
least a valuable, compensation, was offered by the Eastern emperor, to
purchase a necessary peace. Eudoxia and her younger daughter, Placidia,
were honorably restored, and the fury of the Vandals was confined to the
limits of the Western empire. The Italians, destitute of a naval force,
which alone was capable of protecting their coasts, implored the aid of
the more fortunate nations of the East; who had formerly acknowledged,
in peace and war, the supremacy of Rome. But the perpetual divisions of
the two empires had alienated their interest and their inclinations; the
faith of a recent treaty was alleged; and the Western Romans, instead
of arms and ships, could only obtain the assistance of a cold and
ineffectual mediation. The haughty Ricimer, who had long struggled with
the difficulties of his situation, was at length reduced to address the
throne of Constantinople, in the humble language of a subject; and Italy
submitted, as the price and security to accept a master from the choice
of the emperor of the East. <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> It is not the purpose of the present
chapter, or even of the present volume, to continue the distinct series
of the Byzantine history; but a concise view of the reign and character

and Cedrenus.]
</p>
<p>
Since the death of the younger Theodosius, the domestic
repose of Constantinople had never been interrupted by war or faction.
Pulcheria had bestowed her hand, and the sceptre of the East, on the
modest virtue of Marcian: he gratefully reverenced her august rank and
virgin chastity; and, after her death, he gave his people the example of
the religious worship that was due to the memory of the Imperial saint.
<a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> Attentive to the prosperity of his own dominions, Marcian seemed
to behold, with indifference, the misfortunes of Rome; and the obstinate
refusal of a brave and active prince, to draw his sword against the
Vandals, was ascribed to a secret promise, which had formerly been
exacted from him when he was a captive in the power of Genseric. <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a>
The death of Marcian, after a reign of seven years, would have exposed
the East to the danger of a popular election; if the superior weight of
a single family had not been able to incline the balance in favor of the
candidate whose interest they supported. The patrician Aspar might
have placed the diadem on his own head, if he would have subscribed the
Nicene creed. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> During three generations, the armies of the East
were successively commanded by his father, by himself, and by his son
Ardaburius; his Barbarian guards formed a military force that overawed
the palace and the capital; and the liberal distribution of his immense
treasures rendered Aspar as popular as he was powerful. He recommended
the obscure name of Leo of Thrace, a military tribune, and the principal
steward of his household. His nomination was unanimously ratified by the
senate; and the servant of Aspar received the Imperial crown from the
hands of the patriarch or bishop, who was permitted to express, by this
unusual ceremony, the suffrage of the Deity. <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> This emperor, the
first of the name of Leo, has been distinguished by the title of the
Great; from a succession of princes, who gradually fixed in the opinion
of the Greeks a very humble standard of heroic, or at least of royal,
perfection. Yet the temperate firmness with which Leo resisted the
oppression of his benefactor, showed that he was conscious of his duty
and of his prerogative. Aspar was astonished to find that his influence
could no longer appoint a praefect of Constantinople: he presumed to
reproach his sovereign with a breach of promise, and insolently shaking
his purple, "It is not proper, (said he,) that the man who is invested
with this garment, should be guilty of lying." "Nor is it proper,
(replied Leo,) that a prince should be compelled to resign his own
judgment, and the public interest, to the will of a subject."<a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> After
this extraordinary scene, it was impossible that the reconciliation of
the emperor and the patrician could be sincere; or, at least, that it
could be solid and permanent. An army of Isaurians <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> was secretly
levied, and introduced into Constantinople; and while Leo undermined the
authority, and prepared the disgrace, of the family of Aspar, his
mild and cautious behavior restrained them from any rash and desperate
attempts, which might have been fatal to themselves, or their enemies.
The measures of peace and war were affected by this internal revolution.
As long as Aspar degraded the majesty of the throne, the secret
correspondence of religion and interest engaged him to favor the cause
of Genseric. When Leo had delivered himself from that ignominious
servitude, he listened to the complaints of the Italians; resolved to
extirpate the tyranny of the Vandals; and declared his alliance with
his colleague, Anthemius, whom he solemnly invested with the diadem and
purple of the West.

<p>
The virtues of Anthemius have perhaps been magnified, since the Imperial
descent, which he could only deduce from the usurper Procopius, has been
swelled into a line of emperors. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> But the merit of his immediate
parents, their honors, and their riches, rendered Anthemius one of the
most illustrious subjects of the East. His father, Procopius, obtained,
after his Persian embassy, the rank of general and patrician; and
the name of Anthemius was derived from his maternal grandfather, the
celebrated praefect, who protected, with so much ability and success,
the infant reign of Theodosius. The grandson of the praefect was raised
above the condition of a private subject, by his marriage with Euphemia,
the daughter of the emperor Marcian. This splendid alliance, which might
supersede the necessity of merit, hastened the promotion of Anthemius to
the successive dignities of count, of master-general, of consul, and
of patrician; and his merit or fortune claimed the honors of a victory,
which was obtained on the banks of the Danube, over the Huns. Without
indulging an extravagant ambition, the son-in-law of Marcian might hope
to be his successor; but Anthemius supported the disappointment with
courage and patience; and his subsequent elevation was universally
approved by the public, who esteemed him worthy to reign, till
he ascended the throne. <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> The emperor of the West marched from
Constantinople, attended by several counts of high distinction, and a
body of guards almost equal to the strength and numbers of a regular
army: he entered Rome in triumph, and the choice of Leo was confirmed
by the senate, the people, and the Barbarian confederates of Italy. <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a>
The solemn inauguration of Anthemius was followed by the nuptials of
his daughter and the patrician Ricimer; a fortunate event, which was
considered as the firmest security of the union and happiness of the
state. The wealth of two empires was ostentatiously displayed; and many
senators completed their ruin, by an expensive effort to disguise their
poverty. All serious business was suspended during this festival; the
courts of justice were shut; the streets of Rome, the theatres, the
places of public and private resort, resounded with hymeneal songs and
dances: and the royal bride, clothed in silken robes, with a crown on
her head, was conducted to the palace of Ricimer, who had changed
his military dress for the habit of a consul and a senator. On this
memorable occasion, Sidonius, whose early ambition had been so fatally
blasted, appeared as the orator of Auvergne, among the provincial
deputies who addressed the throne with congratulations or complaints.
<a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> The calends of January were now approaching, and the venal poet,
who had loved Avitus, and esteemed Majorian, was persuaded by his
friends to celebrate, in heroic verse, the merit, the felicity, the
second consulship, and the future triumphs, of the emperor Anthemius.
Sidonius pronounced, with assurance and success, a panegyric which is
still extant; and whatever might be the imperfections, either of the
subject or of the composition, the welcome flatterer was immediately
rewarded with the praefecture of Rome; a dignity which placed him among
the illustrious personages of the empire, till he wisely preferred the
more respectable character of a bishop and a saint. <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a>

foundation of a public bath, a church, and a hospital for old men. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a>
Yet some suspicious appearances are found to sully the theological fame
of Anthemius. From the conversation of Philotheus, a Macedonian sectary,
he had imbibed the spirit of religious toleration; and the Heretics
of Rome would have assembled with impunity, if the bold and vehement
censure which Pope Hilary pronounced in the church of St. Peter, had not
obliged him to abjure the unpopular indulgence. <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> Even the Pagans,
a feeble and obscure remnant, conceived some vain hopes, from the
indifference, or partiality, of Anthemius; and his singular friendship
for the philosopher Severus, whom he promoted to the consulship, was
ascribed to a secret project, of reviving the ancient worship of the
gods. <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> These idols were crumbled into dust: and the mythology which
had once been the creed of nations, was so universally disbelieved, that
it might be employed without scandal, or at least without suspicion,
by Christian poets. <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> Yet the vestiges of superstition were not
absolutely obliterated, and the festival of the Lupercalia, whose origin
had preceded the foundation of Rome, was still celebrated under the
reign of Anthemius. The savage and simple rites were expressive of an
early state of society before the invention of arts and agriculture. The
rustic deities who presided over the toils and pleasures of the pastoral
life, Pan, Faunus, and their train of satyrs, were such as the fancy of
shepherds might create, sportive, petulant, and lascivious; whose power
was limited, and whose malice was inoffensive. A goat was the offering
the best adapted to their character and attributes; the flesh of the
victim was roasted on willow spits; and the riotous youths, who crowded
to the feast, ran naked about the fields, with leather thongs in their
hands, communicating, as it was supposed, the blessing of fecundity to
the women whom they touched. <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> The altar of Pan was erected, perhaps
by Evander the Arcadian, in a dark recess in the side of the Palantine
hill, watered by a perpetual fountain, and shaded by a hanging grove.
A tradition, that, in the same place, Romulus and Remus were suckled by
the wolf, rendered it still more sacred and venerable in the eyes of
the Romans; and this sylvan spot was gradually surrounded by the stately
edifices of the Forum. <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> After the conversion of the Imperial city,
the Christians still continued, in the month of February, the annual
celebration of the Lupercalia; to which they ascribed a secret and
mysterious influence on the genial powers of the animal and vegetable
world.

<h2>
    Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
In all his public declarations, the emperor Leo assumes the authority,
and professes the affection, of a father, for his son Anthemius,
with whom he had divided the administration of the universe. <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a>
The situation, and perhaps the character, of Leo, dissuaded him from
exposing his person to the toils and dangers of an African war. But the
powers of the Eastern empire were strenuously exerted to deliver Italy
and the Mediterranean from the Vandals; and Genseric, who had so long
oppressed both the land and sea, was threatened from every side with a
formidable invasion. The campaign was opened by a bold and successful
enterprise of the praefect Heraclius. <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> The troops of Egypt, Thebais,
and Libya, were embarked, under his command; and the Arabs, with a train
of horses and camels, opened the roads of the desert. Heraclius landed
on the coast of Tripoli, surprised and subdued the cities of that
province, and prepared, by a laborious march, which Cato had formerly
executed, <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> to join the Imperial army under the walls of Carthage.
The intelligence of this loss extorted from Genseric some insidious
and ineffectual propositions of peace; but he was still more seriously
alarmed by the reconciliation of Marcellinus with the two empires. The
independent patrician had been persuaded to acknowledge the legitimate
title of Anthemius, whom he accompanied in his journey to Rome; the
Dalmatian fleet was received into the harbors of Italy; the active valor
of Marcellinus expelled the Vandals from the Island of Sardinia; and
the languid efforts of the West added some weight to the immense
preparations of the Eastern Romans. The expense of the naval armament,
which Leo sent against the Vandals, has been distinctly ascertained; and
the curious and instructive account displays the wealth of the declining
empire. The Royal demesnes, or private patrimony of the prince, supplied
seventeen thousand pounds of gold; forty-seven thousand pounds of gold,
and seven hundred thousand of silver, were levied and paid into the
treasury by the Praetorian praefects. But the cities were reduced to
extreme poverty; and the diligent calculation of fines and forfeitures,
as a valuable object of the revenue, does not suggest the idea of a just
or merciful administration. The whole expense, by whatsoever means
it was defrayed, of the African campaign, amounted to the sum of one
hundred and thirty thousand pounds of gold, about five millions two
hundred thousand pounds sterling, at a time when the value of money
appears, from the comparative price of corn, to have been somewhat
higher than in the present age. <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> The fleet that sailed from
Constantinople to Carthage, consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen
ships, and the number of soldiers and mariners exceeded one hundred
thousand men. Basiliscus, the brother of the empress Vorina, was
intrusted with this important command. His sister, the wife of Leo, had
exaggerated the merit of his former exploits against the Scythians. But
the discovery of his guilt, or incapacity, was reserved for the
African war; and his friends could only save his military reputation by
asserting, that he had conspired with Aspar to spare Genseric, and to
betray the last hope of the Western empire.

which Tillemont, (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. vi. p. 396) has laboriously
collected from the Byzantine writers, are less certain, and less
important. The historian Malchus laments the public misery, (Excerpt.
ex Suida in Corp. Hist. Byzant. p. 58;) but he is surely unjust, when
he charges Leo with hoarding the treasures which he extorted from the
people. * Note: Compare likewise the newly-discovered work of Lydus, de
Magistratibus, ed. Hase, Paris, 1812, (and in the new collection of the
Byzantines,) l. iii. c. 43. Lydus states the expenditure at 65,000
lbs. of gold, 700,000 of silver. But Lydus exaggerates the fleet to the
incredible number of 10,000 long ships, (Liburnae,) and the troops to
400,000 men. Lydus describes this fatal measure, of which he charges the
blame on Basiliscus, as the shipwreck of the state. From that time all
the revenues of the empire were anticipated; and the finances fell into
inextricable confusion.&mdash;M.]

Experience has shown, that the success
of an invader most commonly depends on the vigor and celerity of his
operations. The strength and sharpness of the first impression are
blunted by delay; the health and spirit of the troops insensibly
languish in a distant climate; the naval and military force, a mighty
effort which perhaps can never be repeated, is silently consumed;
and every hour that is wasted in negotiation, accustoms the enemy to
contemplate and examine those hostile terrors, which, on their first
appearance, he deemed irresistible. The formidable navy of Basiliscus
pursued its prosperous navigation from the Thracian Bosphorus to the
coast of Africa. He landed his troops at Cape Bona, or the promontory
of Mercury, about forty miles from Carthage. <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a> The army of Heraclius,
and the fleet of Marcellinus, either joined or seconded the Imperial
lieutenant; and the Vandals who opposed his progress by sea or land,
were successively vanquished. <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> If Basiliscus had seized the moment
of consternation, and boldly advanced to the capital, Carthage must have
surrendered, and the kingdom of the Vandals was extinguished. Genseric
beheld the danger with firmness, and eluded it with his veteran
dexterity. He protested, in the most respectful language, that he
was ready to submit his person, and his dominions, to the will of the
emperor; but he requested a truce of five days to regulate the terms
of his submission; and it was universally believed, that his secret
liberality contributed to the success of this public negotiation.
Instead of obstinately refusing whatever indulgence his enemy so
earnestly solicited, the guilty, or the credulous, Basiliscus consented
to the fatal truce; and his imprudent security seemed to proclaim, that
he already considered himself as the conqueror of Africa. During this
short interval, the wind became favorable to the designs of Genseric.
He manned his largest ships of war with the bravest of the Moors
and Vandals; and they towed after them many large barks, filled with
combustible materials. In the obscurity of the night, these destructive
vessels were impelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of
the Romans, who were awakened by the sense of their instant danger.
Their close and crowded order assisted the progress of the fire, which
was communicated with rapid and irresistible violence; and the noise
of the wind, the crackling of the flames, the dissonant cries of the
soldiers and mariners, who could neither command nor obey, increased
the horror of the nocturnal tumult. Whilst they labored to extricate
themselves from the fire-ships, and to save at least a part of the navy,
the galleys of Genseric assaulted them with temperate and disciplined
valor; and many of the Romans, who escaped the fury of the flames, were
destroyed or taken by the victorious Vandals. Among the events of that
disastrous night, the heroic, or rather desperate, courage of John,
one of the principal officers of Basiliscus, has rescued his name from
oblivion. When the ship, which he had bravely defended, was almost
consumed, he threw himself in his armor into the sea, disdainfully
rejected the esteem and pity of Genso, the son of Genseric, who pressed
him to accept honorable quarter, and sunk under the waves; exclaiming,
with his last breath, that he would never fall alive into the hands
of those impious dogs. Actuated by a far different spirit, Basiliscus,
whose station was the most remote from danger, disgracefully fled in the
beginning of the engagement, returned to Constantinople with the loss of
more than half of his fleet and army, and sheltered his guilty head
in the sanctuary of St. Sophia, till his sister, by her tears and
entreaties, could obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor.
Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert; Marcellinus retired
to Sicily, where he was assassinated, perhaps at the instigation
of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals
expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves
should remove from the world his most formidable antagonists. <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> After
the failure of this great expedition, <a href="#note-891" name="noteref-891"><small>891</small></a> Genseric again became the
tyrant of the sea: the coasts of Italy, Greece, and Asia, were again
exposed to his revenge and avarice; Tripoli and Sardinia returned to his
obedience; he added Sicily to the number of his provinces; and before
he died, in the fulness of years and of glory, he beheld the final
extinction of the empire of the West. <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a>

</p>
<p>
During his long and active reign, the African monarch had studiously
cultivated the friendship of the Barbarians of Europe, whose arms he
might employ in a seasonable and effectual diversion against the two
empires. After the death of Attila, he renewed his alliance with the
Visigoths of Gaul; and the sons of the elder Theodoric, who successively
reigned over that warlike nation, were easily persuaded, by the sense
of interest, to forget the cruel affront which Genseric had inflicted on
their sister. <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a> The death of the emperor Majorian delivered Theodoric
the Second from the restraint of fear, and perhaps of honor; he violated
his recent treaty with the Romans; and the ample territory of Narbonne,
which he firmly united to his dominions, became the immediate reward of
his perfidy. The selfish policy of Ricimer encouraged him to invade the
provinces which were in the possession of Aegidius, his rival; but the
active count, by the defence of Arles, and the victory of Orleans, saved
Gaul, and checked, during his lifetime, the progress of the Visigoths.
Their ambition was soon rekindled; and the design of extinguishing the
Roman empire in Spain and Gaul was conceived, and almost completed,
in the reign of Euric, who assassinated his brother Theodoric, and
displayed, with a more savage temper, superior abilities, both in peace
and war. He passed the Pyrenees at the head of a numerous army, subdued
the cities of Saragossa and Pampeluna, vanquished in battle the martial
nobles of the Tarragonese province, carried his victorious arms into
the heart of Lusitania, and permitted the Suevi to hold the kingdom of
Gallicia under the Gothic monarchy of Spain. <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> The efforts of Euric
were not less vigorous, or less successful, in Gaul; and throughout the
country that extends from the Pyrenees to the Rhone and the Loire,
Berry and Auvergne were the only cities, or dioceses, which refused to
acknowledge him as their master. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> In the defence of Clermont, their
principal town, the inhabitants of Auvergne sustained, with inflexible
resolution, the miseries of war, pestilence, and famine; and the
Visigoths, relinquishing the fruitless siege, suspended the hopes of
that important conquest. The youth of the province were animated by the
heroic, and almost incredible, valor of Ecdicius, the son of the emperor
Avitus, <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> who made a desperate sally with only eighteen horsemen,
boldly attacked the Gothic army, and, after maintaining a flying
skirmish, retired safe and victorious within the walls of Clermont. His
charity was equal to his courage: in a time of extreme scarcity, four
thousand poor were fed at his expense; and his private influence levied
an army of Burgundians for the deliverance of Auvergne. From his virtues
alone the faithful citizens of Gaul derived any hopes of safety or
freedom; and even such virtues were insufficient to avert the impending
ruin of their country, since they were anxious to learn, from his
authority and example, whether they should prefer the alternative of
exile or servitude. <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> The public confidence was lost; the resources
of the state were exhausted; and the Gauls had too much reason to
believe, that Anthemius, who reigned in Italy, was incapable of
protecting his distressed subjects beyond the Alps. The feeble emperor
could only procure for their defence the service of twelve thousand
British auxiliaries. Riothamus, one of the independent kings, or
chieftains, of the island, was persuaded to transport his troops to the
continent of Gaul: he sailed up the Loire, and established his quarters
in Berry, where the people complained of these oppressive allies, till
they were destroyed or dispersed by the arms of the Visigoths. <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a>

</p>
<p>
One of the last acts of jurisdiction, which the Roman
senate exercised over their subjects of Gaul, was the trial and
condemnation of Arvandus, the Praetorian praefect. Sidonius, who
rejoices that he lived under a reign in which he might pity and assist
a state criminal, has expressed, with tenderness and freedom, the faults
of his indiscreet and unfortunate friend. <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> From the perils which he
had escaped, Arvandus imbibed confidence rather than wisdom; and such
was the various, though uniform, imprudence of his behavior, that his
prosperity must appear much more surprising than his downfall. The
second praefecture, which he obtained within the term of five years,
abolished the merit and popularity of his preceding administration. His
easy temper was corrupted by flattery, and exasperated by opposition; he
was forced to satisfy his importunate creditors with the spoils of the
province; his capricious insolence offended the nobles of Gaul, and he
sunk under the weight of the public hatred. The mandate of his disgrace
summoned him to justify his conduct before the senate; and he passed
the Sea of Tuscany with a favorable wind, the presage, as he vainly
imagined, of his future fortunes. A decent respect was still observed
for the Proefectorian rank; and on his arrival at Rome, Arvandus was
committed to the hospitality, rather than to the custody, of Flavius
Asellus, the count of the sacred largesses, who resided in the Capitol.
<a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> He was eagerly pursued by his accusers, the four deputies of Gaul,
who were all distinguished by their birth, their dignities, or their
eloquence. In the name of a great province, and according to the forms
of Roman jurisprudence, they instituted a civil and criminal
action, requiring such restitution as might compensate the losses of
individuals, and such punishment as might satisfy the justice of the
state. Their charges of corrupt oppression were numerous and weighty;
but they placed their secret dependence on a letter which they had
intercepted, and which they could prove, by the evidence of his
secretary, to have been dictated by Arvandus himself. The author of this
letter seemed to dissuade the king of the Goths from a peace with the
Greek emperor: he suggested the attack of the Britons on the Loire;
and he recommended a division of Gaul, according to the law of nations,
between the Visigoths and the Burgundians. <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> These pernicious
schemes, which a friend could only palliate by the reproaches of vanity
and indiscretion, were susceptible of a treasonable interpretation; and
the deputies had artfully resolved not to produce their most formidable
weapons till the decisive moment of the contest. But their intentions
were discovered by the zeal of Sidonius. He immediately apprised the
unsuspecting criminal of his danger; and sincerely lamented, without any
mixture of anger, the haughty presumption of Arvandus, who rejected, and
even resented, the salutary advice of his friends. Ignorant of his real
situation, Arvandus showed himself in the Capitol in the white robe of
a candidate, accepted indiscriminate salutations and offers of service,
examined the shops of the merchants, the silks and gems, sometimes with
the indifference of a spectator, and sometimes with the attention of a
purchaser; and complained of the times, of the senate, of the prince,
and of the delays of justice. His complaints were soon removed. An early
day was fixed for his trial; and Arvandus appeared, with his accusers,
before a numerous assembly of the Roman senate. The mournful garb
which they affected, excited the compassion of the judges, who were
scandalized by the gay and splendid dress of their adversary: and when
the praefect Arvandus, with the first of the Gallic deputies, were
directed to take their places on the senatorial benches, the same
contrast of pride and modesty was observed in their behavior. In this
memorable judgment, which presented a lively image of the old republic,
the Gauls exposed, with force and freedom, the grievances of the
province; and as soon as the minds of the audience were sufficiently
inflamed, they recited the fatal epistle. The obstinacy of Arvandus
was founded on the strange supposition, that a subject could not be
convicted of treason, unless he had actually conspired to assume the
purple. As the paper was read, he repeatedly, and with a loud voice,
acknowledged it for his genuine composition; and his astonishment was
equal to his dismay, when the unanimous voice of the senate declared him
guilty of a capital offence. By their decree, he was degraded from
the rank of a praefect to the obscure condition of a plebeian, and
ignominiously dragged by servile hands to the public prison. After a
fortnight's adjournment, the senate was again convened to pronounce
the sentence of his death; but while he expected, in the Island of
Aesculapius, the expiration of the thirty days allowed by an ancient
law to the vilest malefactors, <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> his friends interposed, the
emperor Anthemius relented, and the praefect of Gaul obtained the milder
punishment of exile and confiscation. The faults of Arvandus might
deserve compassion; but the impunity of Seronatus accused the justice
of the republic, till he was condemned and executed, on the complaint
of the people of Auvergne. That flagitious minister, the Catiline of
his age and country, held a secret correspondence with the Visigoths,
to betray the province which he oppressed: his industry was continually
exercised in the discovery of new taxes and obsolete offences; and his
extravagant vices would have inspired contempt, if they had not excited
fear and abhorrence. <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a>

Such criminals were not beyond the reach of justice; but whatever might
be the guilt of Ricimer, that powerful Barbarian was able to contend
or to negotiate with the prince, whose alliance he had condescended to
accept. The peaceful and prosperous reign which Anthemius had promised
to the West, was soon clouded by misfortune and discord. Ricimer,
apprehensive, or impatient, of a superior, retired from Rome, and fixed
his residence at Milan; an advantageous situation either to invite or
to repel the warlike tribes that were seated between the Alps and the
Danube. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> Italy was gradually divided into two independent and
hostile kingdoms; and the nobles of Liguria, who trembled at the near
approach of a civil war, fell prostrate at the feet of the patrician,
and conjured him to spare their unhappy country. "For my own part,"
replied Ricimer, in a tone of insolent moderation, "I am still inclined
to embrace the friendship of the Galatian; <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> but who will undertake
to appease his anger, or to mitigate the pride, which always rises
in proportion to our submission?" They informed him, that Epiphanius,
bishop of Pavia, <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> united the wisdom of the serpent with the
innocence of the dove; and appeared confident, that the eloquence of
such an ambassador must prevail against the strongest opposition,
either of interest or passion. Their recommendation was approved; and
Epiphanius, assuming the benevolent office of mediation, proceeded
without delay to Rome, where he was received with the honors due to his
merit and reputation. The oration of a bishop in favor of peace may be
easily supposed; he argued, that, in all possible circumstances, the
forgiveness of injuries must be an act of mercy, or magnanimity, or
prudence; and he seriously admonished the emperor to avoid a contest
with a fierce Barbarian, which might be fatal to himself, and must
be ruinous to his dominions. Anthemius acknowledged the truth of his
maxims; but he deeply felt, with grief and indignation, the behavior
of Ricimer, and his passion gave eloquence and energy to his discourse.
"What favors," he warmly exclaimed, "have we refused to this ungrateful
man? What provocations have we not endured! Regardless of the majesty of
the purple, I gave my daughter to a Goth; I sacrificed my own blood to
the safety of the republic. The liberality which ought to have secured
the eternal attachment of Ricimer has exasperated him against his
benefactor. What wars has he not excited against the empire! How often
has he instigated and assisted the fury of hostile nations! Shall I now
accept his perfidious friendship? Can I hope that he will respect the
engagements of a treaty, who has already violated the duties of a son?"
But the anger of Anthemius evaporated in these passionate exclamations:
he insensibly yielded to the proposals of Epiphanius; and the bishop
returned to his diocese with the satisfaction of restoring the peace of
Italy, by a reconciliation, <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> of which the sincerity and continuance
might be reasonably suspected. The clemency of the emperor was extorted
from his weakness; and Ricimer suspended his ambitious designs till he
had secretly prepared the engines with which he resolved to subvert the
throne of Anthemius. The mask of peace and moderation was then thrown
aside. The army of Ricimer was fortified by a numerous reenforcement of
Burgundians and Oriental Suevi: he disclaimed all allegiance to the
Greek emperor, marched from Milan to the Gates of Rome, and fixing his
camp on the banks of the Anio, impatiently expected the arrival of
Olybrius, his Imperial candidate.

</p>
<p>
The senator Olybrius, of the Anician family, might esteem himself the
lawful heir of the Western empire. He had married Placidia, the younger
daughter of Valentinian, after she was restored by Genseric; who still
detained her sister Eudoxia, as the wife, or rather as the captive,
of his son. The king of the Vandals supported, by threats and
solicitations, the fair pretensions of his Roman ally; and assigned, as
one of the motives of the war, the refusal of the senate and people to
acknowledge their lawful prince, and the unworthy preference which they
had given to a stranger. <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> The friendship of the public enemy might
render Olybrius still more unpopular to the Italians; but when Ricimer
meditated the ruin of the emperor Anthemius, he tempted, with the
offer of a diadem, the candidate who could justify his rebellion by an
illustrious name and a royal alliance. The husband of Placidia, who,
like most of his ancestors, had been invested with the consular dignity,
might have continued to enjoy a secure and splendid fortune in the
peaceful residence of Constantinople; nor does he appear to have been
tormented by such a genius as cannot be amused or occupied, unless
by the administration of an empire. Yet Olybrius yielded to the
importunities of his friends, perhaps of his wife; rashly plunged
into the dangers and calamities of a civil war; and, with the secret

bestowed, and resumed, at the capricious will of a Barbarian. He landed
without obstacle (for Genseric was master of the sea) either at Ravenna,
or the port of Ostia, and immediately proceeded to the camp of Ricimer,

</p>
<p>
The patrician, who had extended his posts from the Anio to the Melvian
bridge, already possessed two quarters of Rome, the Vatican and the
Janiculum, which are separated by the Tyber from the rest of the city;
<a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> and it may be conjectured, that an assembly of seceding senators
imitated, in the choice of Olybrius, the forms of a legal election.
But the body of the senate and people firmly adhered to the cause of
Anthemius; and the more effectual support of a Gothic army enabled him
to prolong his reign, and the public distress, by a resistance of three
months, which produced the concomitant evils of famine and pestilence.
At length Ricimer made a furious assault on the bridge of Hadrian, or
St. Angelo; and the narrow pass was defended with equal valor by the
Goths, till the death of Gilimer, their leader. The victorious troops,
breaking down every barrier, rushed with irresistible violence into
the heart of the city, and Rome (if we may use the language of a
contemporary pope) was subverted by the civil fury of Anthemius
and Ricimer. <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> The unfortunate Anthemius was dragged from his
concealment, and inhumanly massacred by the command of his son-in-law;
who thus added a third, or perhaps a fourth, emperor to the number of
his victims. The soldiers, who united the rage of factious citizens with
the savage manners of Barbarians, were indulged, without control, in
the license of rapine and murder: the crowd of slaves and plebeians,
who were unconcerned in the event, could only gain by the indiscriminate
pillage; and the face of the city exhibited the strange contrast of
stern cruelty and dissolute intemperance. <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> Forty days after this
calamitous event, the subject, not of glory, but of guilt, Italy was
delivered, by a painful disease, from the tyrant Ricimer, who bequeathed
the command of his army to his nephew Gundobald, one of the princes of
the Burgundians. In the same year all the principal actors in this great
revolution were removed from the stage; and the whole reign of Olybrius,
whose death does not betray any symptoms of violence, is included within
the term of seven months. He left one daughter, the offspring of
his marriage with Placidia; and the family of the great Theodosius,
transplanted from Spain to Constantinople, was propagated in the female
line as far as the eighth generation. <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>
<p>
Whilst the vacant throne of Italy was abandoned to lawless Barbarians,
<a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> the election of a new colleague was seriously agitated in the
council of Leo. The empress Verina, studious to promote the greatness
of her own family, had married one of her nieces to Julius Nepos, who
succeeded his uncle Marcellinus in the sovereignty of Dalmatia, a more
solid possession than the title which he was persuaded to accept, of
Emperor of the West. But the measures of the Byzantine court were so
languid and irresolute, that many months elapsed after the death of
Anthemius, and even of Olybrius, before their destined successor could
show himself, with a respectable force, to his Italian subjects. During
that interval, Glycerius, an obscure soldier, was invested with the
purple by his patron Gundobald; but the Burgundian prince was unable,
or unwilling, to support his nomination by a civil war: the pursuits of
domestic ambition recalled him beyond the Alps, <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> and his client
was permitted to exchange the Roman sceptre for the bishopric of
Salona. After extinguishing such a competitor, the emperor Nepos was
acknowledged by the senate, by the Italians, and by the provincials of
Gaul; his moral virtues, and military talents, were loudly celebrated;
and those who derived any private benefit from his government,
announced, in prophetic strains, the restoration of the public felicity.
<a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> Their hopes (if such hopes had been entertained) were confounded
within the term of a single year, and the treaty of peace, which ceded
Auvergue to the Visigoths, is the only event of his short and inglorious
reign. The most faithful subjects of Gaul were sacrificed, by the
Italian emperor, to the hope of domestic security; <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> but his repose
was soon invaded by a furious sedition of the Barbarian confederates,
who, under the command of Orestes, their general, were in full march
from Rome to Ravenna. Nepos trembled at their approach; and, instead of
placing a just confidence in the strength of Ravenna, he hastily escaped
to his ships, and retired to his Dalmatian principality, on the opposite
coast of the Adriatic. By this shameful abdication, he protracted his
life about five years, in a very ambiguous state, between an emperor
and an exile, till he was assassinated at Salona by the ungrateful
Glycerius, who was translated, perhaps as the reward of his crime, to
the archbishopric of Milan. <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a>

<p>
The nations who had asserted their independence after the death of
Attila, were established, by the right of possession or conquest, in
the boundless countries to the north of the Danube; or in the Roman
provinces between the river and the Alps. But the bravest of their youth
enlisted in the army of confederates, who formed the defence and the
terror of Italy; <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> and in this promiscuous multitude, the names
of the Heruli, the Scyrri, the Alani, the Turcilingi, and the Rugians,
appear to have predominated. The example of these warriors was imitated
by Orestes, <a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a> the son of Tatullus, and the father of the last Roman
emperor of the West. Orestes, who has been already mentioned in this
History, had never deserted his country. His birth and fortunes rendered
him one of the most illustrious subjects of Pannonia. When that province
was ceded to the Huns, he entered into the service of Attila, his lawful
sovereign, obtained the office of his secretary, and was repeatedly sent
ambassador to Constantinople, to represent the person, and signify the
commands, of the imperious monarch. The death of that conqueror restored
him to his freedom; and Orestes might honorably refuse either to follow
the sons of Attila into the Scythian desert, or to obey the Ostrogoths,
who had usurped the dominion of Pannonia. He preferred the service of
the Italian princes, the successors of Valentinian; and as he possessed
the qualifications of courage, industry, and experience, he advanced
with rapid steps in the military profession, till he was elevated,
by the favor of Nepos himself, to the dignities of patrician, and
master-general of the troops. These troops had been long accustomed to
reverence the character and authority of Orestes, who affected their
manners, conversed with them in their own language, and was intimately
connected with their national chieftains, by long habits of familiarity
and friendship. At his solicitation they rose in arms against the
obscure Greek, who presumed to claim their obedience; and when Orestes,
from some secret motive, declined the purple, they consented, with the
same facility, to acknowledge his son Augustulus as the emperor of the
West. By the abdication of Nepos, Orestes had now attained the summit of
his ambitious hopes; but he soon discovered, before the end of the first
year, that the lessons of perjury and ingratitude, which a rebel must
inculcate, will be resorted to against himself; and that the precarious
sovereign of Italy was only permitted to choose, whether he would be
the slave, or the victim, of his Barbarian mercenaries. The dangerous
alliance of these strangers had oppressed and insulted the last
remains of Roman freedom and dignity. At each revolution, their pay and
privileges were augmented; but their insolence increased in a still more
extravagant degree; they envied the fortune of their brethren in Gaul,
Spain, and Africa, whose victorious arms had acquired an independent
and perpetual inheritance; and they insisted on their peremptory demand,
that a third part of the lands of Italy should be immediately divided
among them. Orestes, with a spirit, which, in another situation, might
be entitled to our esteem, chose rather to encounter the rage of an
armed multitude, than to subscribe the ruin of an innocent people. He
rejected the audacious demand; and his refusal was favorable to the
ambition of Odoacer; a bold Barbarian, who assured his fellow-soldiers,
that, if they dared to associate under his command, they might soon
extort the justice which had been denied to their dutiful petitions.
From all the camps and garrisons of Italy, the confederates, actuated
by the same resentment and the same hopes, impatiently flocked to
the standard of this popular leader; and the unfortunate patrician,
overwhelmed by the torrent, hastily retreated to the strong city of
Pavia, the episcopal seat of the holy Epiphanites. Pavia was immediately
besieged, the fortifications were stormed, the town was pillaged; and
although the bishop might labor, with much zeal and some success, to
save the property of the church, and the chastity of female captives,
the tumult could only be appeased by the execution of Orestes. <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a>
His brother Paul was slain in an action near Ravenna; and the helpless
Augustulus, who could no longer command the respect, was reduced to
implore the clemency, of Odoacer.

That successful Barbarian was the son of Edecon; who, in some remarkable
transactions, particularly described in a preceding chapter, had been
the colleague of Orestes himself. <a href="#note-1191" name="noteref-1191"><small>1191</small></a> The honor of an ambassador
should be exempt from suspicion; and Edecon had listened to a conspiracy
against the life of his sovereign. But this apparent guilt was expiated
by his merit or repentance; his rank was eminent and conspicuous; he
enjoyed the favor of Attila; and the troops under his command, who
guarded, in their turn, the royal village, consisted of a tribe of
Scyrri, his immediate and hereditary subjects. In the revolt of the
nations, they still adhered to the Huns; and more than twelve years
afterwards, the name of Edecon is honorably mentioned, in their unequal
contests with the Ostrogoths; which was terminated, after two bloody
battles, by the defeat and dispersion of the Scyrri. <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> Their gallant
leader, who did not survive this national calamity, left two sons, Onulf
and Odoacer, to struggle with adversity, and to maintain as they might,
by rapine or service, the faithful followers of their exile. Onulf
directed his steps towards Constantinople, where he sullied, by the
assassination of a generous benefactor, the fame which he had acquired
in arms. His brother Odoacer led a wandering life among the Barbarians
of Noricum, with a mind and a fortune suited to the most desperate
adventures; and when he had fixed his choice, he piously visited the
cell of Severinus, the popular saint of the country, to solicit his
approbation and blessing. The lowness of the door would not admit the
lofty stature of Odoacer: he was obliged to stoop; but in that humble
attitude the saint could discern the symptoms of his future greatness;
and addressing him in a prophetic tone, "Pursue" (said he) "your design;
proceed to Italy; you will soon cast away this coarse garment of skins;
and your wealth will be adequate to the liberality of your mind." <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a>
The Barbarian, whose daring spirit accepted and ratified the prediction,
was admitted into the service of the Western empire, and soon obtained
an honorable rank in the guards. His manners were gradually polished,
his military skill was improved, and the confederates of Italy would not
have elected him for their general, unless the exploits of Odoacer had
established a high opinion of his courage and capacity. <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> Their
military acclamations saluted him with the title of king; but he
abstained, during his whole reign, from the use of the purple and
diadem, <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a> lest he should offend those princes, whose subjects, by
their accidental mixture, had formed the victorious army, which time and

<p>
Royalty was familiar to the Barbarians, and the submissive people of
Italy was prepared to obey, without a murmur, the authority which he
should condescend to exercise as the vicegerent of the emperor of the
West. But Odoacer had resolved to abolish that useless and expensive
office; and such is the weight of antique prejudice, that it required
some boldness and penetration to discover the extreme facility of the
enterprise. The unfortunate Augustulus was made the instrument of his
own disgrace: he signified his resignation to the senate; and that
assembly, in their last act of obedience to a Roman prince, still
affected the spirit of freedom, and the forms of the constitution. An
epistle was addressed, by their unanimous decree, to the emperor Zeno,
the son-in-law and successor of Leo; who had lately been restored, after
a short rebellion, to the Byzantine throne. They solemnly "disclaim
the necessity, or even the wish, of continuing any longer the Imperial
succession in Italy; since, in their opinion, the majesty of a sole
monarch is sufficient to pervade and protect, at the same time, both
the East and the West. In their own name, and in the name of the people,
they consent that the seat of universal empire shall be transferred from
Rome to Constantinople; and they basely renounce the right of choosing
their master, the only vestige that yet remained of the authority which
had given laws to the world. The republic (they repeat that name without
a blush) might safely confide in the civil and military virtues of
Odoacer; and they humbly request, that the emperor would invest him with
the title of Patrician, and the administration of the diocese of Italy."
The deputies of the senate were received at Constantinople with some
marks of displeasure and indignation: and when they were admitted to the
audience of Zeno, he sternly reproached them with their treatment of
the two emperors, Anthemius and Nepos, whom the East had successively
granted to the prayers of Italy. "The first" (continued he) "you have
murdered; the second you have expelled; but the second is still alive,
and whilst he lives he is your lawful sovereign." But the prudent Zeno
soon deserted the hopeless cause of his abdicated colleague. His vanity
was gratified by the title of sole emperor, and by the statues erected
to his honor in the several quarters of Rome; he entertained a friendly,
though ambiguous, correspondence with the patrician Odoacer; and he
gratefully accepted the Imperial ensigns, the sacred ornaments of the
throne and palace, which the Barbarian was not unwilling to remove from
the sight of the people. <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a>

In the space of twenty years since the death of Valentinian, nine
emperors had successively disappeared; and the son of Orestes, a youth
recommended only by his beauty, would be the least entitled to the
notice of posterity, if his reign, which was marked by the extinction
of the Roman empire in the West, did not leave a memorable era in the
history of mankind. <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a> The patrician Orestes had married the
daughter of Count Romulus, of Petovio in Noricum: the name of Augustus,
notwithstanding the jealousy of power, was known at Aquileia as a
familiar surname; and the appellations of the two great founders, of
the city and of the monarchy, were thus strangely united in the last
of their successors. <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> The son of Orestes assumed and disgraced the
names of Romulus Augustus; but the first was corrupted into Momyllus,
by the Greeks, and the second has been changed by the Latins into the
contemptible diminutive Augustulus. The life of this inoffensive youth
was spared by the generous clemency of Odoacer; who dismissed him, with
his whole family, from the Imperial palace, fixed his annual allowance
at six thousand pieces of gold, and assigned the castle of Lucullus, in
Campania, for the place of his exile or retirement. <a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a> As soon as the
Romans breathed from the toils of the Punic war, they were attracted by
the beauties and the pleasures of Campania; and the country-house of
the elder Scipio at Liternum exhibited a lasting model of their rustic
simplicity. <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> The delicious shores of the Bay of Naples were crowded
with villas; and Sylla applauded the masterly skill of his rival, who
had seated himself on the lofty promontory of Misenum, that commands, on
every side, the sea and land, as far as the boundaries of the horizon.
<a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a> The villa of Marius was purchased, within a few years, by
Lucullus, and the price had increased from two thousand five hundred, to
more than fourscore thousand, pounds sterling. <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> It was adorned
by the new proprietor with Grecian arts and Asiatic treasures; and the
houses and gardens of Lucullus obtained a distinguished rank in the list
of Imperial palaces. <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a> When the Vandals became formidable to the
sea-coast, the Lucullan villa, on the promontory of Misenum, gradually
assumed the strength and appellation of a strong castle, the obscure
retreat of the last emperor of the West. About twenty years after that
great revolution, it was converted into a church and monastery, to
receive the bones of St. Severinus. They securely reposed, amidst the
the broken trophies of Cimbric and Armenian victories,till the beginning
of the tenth century; when the fortifications, which might afford a
dangerous shelter to the Saracens, were demolished by the people of
Naples. <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a>

<p>
Odoacer was the first Barbarian who reigned in Italy, over a people who
had once asserted their just superiority above the rest of mankind. The
disgrace of the Romans still excites our respectful compassion, and
we fondly sympathize with the imaginary grief and indignation of their
degenerate posterity. But the calamities of Italy had gradually subdued
the proud consciousness of freedom and glory. In the age of Roman virtue
the provinces were subject to the arms, and the citizens to the laws, of
the republic; till those laws were subverted by civil discord, and both
the city and the province became the servile property of a tyrant. The
forms of the constitution, which alleviated or disguised their abject
slavery, were abolished by time and violence; the Italians alternately
lamented the presence or the absence of the sovereign, whom they
detested or despised; and the succession of five centuries inflicted the
various evils of military license, capricious despotism, and elaborate
oppression. During the same period, the Barbarians had emerged from
obscurity and contempt, and the warriors of Germany and Scythia were
introduced into the provinces, as the servants, the allies, and at
length the masters, of the Romans, whom they insulted or protected. The
hatred of the people was suppressed by fear; they respected the spirit
and splendor of the martial chiefs who were invested with the honors of
the empire; and the fate of Rome had long depended on the sword of those
formidable strangers. The stern Ricimer, who trampled on the ruins of
Italy, had exercised the power, without assuming the title, of a king;
and the patient Romans were insensibly prepared to acknowledge the
royalty of Odoacer and his Barbaric successors. The king of Italy was
not unworthy of the high station to which his valor and fortune
had exalted him: his savage manners were polished by the habits of
conversation; and he respected, though a conqueror and a Barbarian,
the institutions, and even the prejudices, of his subjects. After an
interval of seven years, Odoacer restored the consulship of the West.
For himself, he modestly, or proudly, declined an honor which was
still accepted by the emperors of the East; but the curule chair was
successively filled by eleven of the most illustrious senators; <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a>
and the list is adorned by the respectable name of Basilius, whose
virtues claimed the friendship and grateful applause of Sidonius, his
client. <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a> The laws of the emperors were strictly enforced, and the
civil administration of Italy was still exercised by the Praetorian
praefect and his subordinate officers. Odoacer devolved on the Roman
magistrates the odious and oppressive task of collecting the public
revenue; but he reserved for himself the merit of seasonable and
popular indulgence. <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a> Like the rest of the Barbarians, he had
been instructed in the Arian heresy; but he revered the monastic and
episcopal characters; and the silence of the Catholics attest the
toleration which they enjoyed. The peace of the city required the
interposition of his praefect Basilius in the choice of a Roman pontiff:
the decree which restrained the clergy from alienating their lands was
ultimately designed for the benefit of the people, whose devotions would
have been taxed to repair the dilapidations of the church. <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a> Italy
was protected by the arms of its conqueror; and its frontiers were
respected by the Barbarians of Gaul and Germany, who had so long
insulted the feeble race of Theodosius. Odoacer passed the Adriatic, to
chastise the assassins of the emperor Nepos, and to acquire the maritime
province of Dalmatia. He passed the Alps, to rescue the remains of
Noricum from Fava, or Feletheus, king of the Rugians, who held his
residence beyond the Danube. The king was vanquished in battle, and
led away prisoner; a numerous colony of captives and subjects was
transplanted into Italy; and Rome, after a long period of defeat and
disgrace, might claim the triumph of her Barbarian master. <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a>

[ The wars of Odoacer are concisely mentioned by Paul the

in the two Chronicles of Cassiodorus and Cuspinian. The life of St.
Severinus by Eugippius, which the count de Buat (Hist. des Peuples, &amp;c.,

</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding the prudence and success of Odoacer, his kingdom
exhibited the sad prospect of misery and desolation. Since the age of
Tiberius, the decay of agriculture had been felt in Italy; and it was a
just subject of complaint, that the life of the Roman people depended
on the accidents of the winds and waves. <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a> In the division and the
decline of the empire, the tributary harvests of Egypt and Africa were
withdrawn; the numbers of the inhabitants continually diminished
with the means of subsistence; and the country was exhausted by the
irretrievable losses of war, famine, <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a> and pestilence. St. Ambrose
has deplored the ruin of a populous district, which had been once
adorned with the flourishing cities of Bologna, Modena, Regium, and
Placentia. <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a> Pope Gelasius was a subject of Odoacer; and he affirms,
with strong exaggeration, that in Aemilia, Tuscany, and the adjacent
provinces, the human species was almost extirpated. <a href="#note-141" name="noteref-141"><small>141</small></a> The plebeians
of Rome, who were fed by the hand of their master, perished or
disappeared, as soon as his liberality was suppressed; the decline of
the arts reduced the industrious mechanic to idleness and want; and the
senators, who might support with patience the ruin of their country,
bewailed their private loss of wealth and luxury. <a href="#note-1411" name="noteref-1411"><small>1411</small></a> One third of
those ample estates, to which the ruin of Italy is originally imputed,
<a href="#note-142" name="noteref-142"><small>142</small></a> was extorted for the use of the conquerors. Injuries were
aggravated by insults; the sense of actual sufferings was imbittered by
the fear of more dreadful evils; and as new lands were allotted to
the new swarms of Barbarians, each senator was apprehensive lest the
arbitrary surveyors should approach his favorite villa, or his most
profitable farm. The least unfortunate were those who submitted without
a murmur to the power which it was impossible to resist. Since they
desired to live, they owed some gratitude to the tyrant who had spared
their lives; and since he was the absolute master of their fortunes, the
portion which he left must be accepted as his pure and voluntary gift.
<a href="#note-143" name="noteref-143"><small>143</small></a> The distress of Italy <a href="#note-1431" name="noteref-1431"><small>1431</small></a> was mitigated by the prudence
and humanity of Odoacer, who had bound himself, as the price of
his elevation, to satisfy the demands of a licentious and turbulent
multitude. The kings of the Barbarians were frequently resisted,
deposed, or murdered, by their native subjects, and the various bands
of Italian mercenaries, who associated under the standard of an elective
general, claimed a larger privilege of freedom and rapine. A monarchy
destitute of national union, and hereditary right, hastened to its
dissolution. After a reign of fourteen years, Odoacer was oppressed by
the superior genius of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths; a hero alike
excellent in the arts of war and of government, who restored an age
of peace and prosperity, and whose name still excites and deserves the
attention of mankind.

[ Denina supposes that the Barbarians were compelled
by necessity to turn their attention to agriculture. Italy, either
imperfectly cultivated, or not at all, by the indolent or ruined
proprietors, not only could not furnish the imposts, on which the pay of
the soldiery depended, but not even a certain supply of the necessaries
of life. The neighboring countries were now occupied by warlike nations;
the supplies of corn from Africa were cut off; foreign commerce nearly
destroyed; they could not look for supplies beyond the limits of Italy,
throughout which the agriculture had been long in a state of progressive
but rapid depression. (Denina, Rev. d'Italia t. v. c. i.)&mdash;M.]
