<p>
The Gauls, <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> who impatiently supported the Roman yoke, received a
memorable lesson from one of the lieutenants of Vespasian, whose weighty
sense has been refined and expressed by the genius of Tacitus. <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> "The
protection of the republic has delivered Gaul from internal discord
and foreign invasions. By the loss of national independence, you have
acquired the name and privileges of Roman citizens. You enjoy, in common
with yourselves, the permanent benefits of civil government; and your
remote situation is less exposed to the accidental mischiefs of tyranny.
Instead of exercising the rights of conquest, we have been contented to
impose such tributes as are requisite for your own preservation. Peace
cannot be secured without armies; and armies must be supported at the
expense of the people. It is for your sake, not for our own, that we
guard the barrier of the Rhine against the ferocious Germans, who have
so often attempted, and who will always desire, to exchange the solitude
of their woods and morasses for the wealth and fertility of Gaul. The
fall of Rome would be fatal to the provinces; and you would be buried in
the ruins of that mighty fabric, which has been raised by the valor and
wisdom of eight hundred years. Your imaginary freedom would be insulted
and oppressed by a savage master; and the expulsion of the Romans would
be succeeded by the eternal hostilities of the Barbarian conquerors."
<a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> This salutary advice was accepted, and this strange prediction was
accomplished. In the space of four hundred years, the hardy Gauls, who
had encountered the arms of Caesar, were imperceptibly melted into the
general mass of citizens and subjects: the Western empire was dissolved;
and the Germans, who had passed the Rhine, fiercely contended for the
possession of Gaul, and excited the contempt, or abhorrence, of its
peaceful and polished inhabitants. With that conscious pride which
the preeminence of knowledge and luxury seldom fails to inspire, they
derided the hairy and gigantic savages of the North; their rustic
manners, dissonant joy, voracious appetite, and their horrid appearance,
equally disgusting to the sight and to the smell. The liberal studies
were still cultivated in the schools of Autun and Bordeaux; and the
language of Cicero and Virgil was familiar to the Gallic youth. Their
ears were astonished by the harsh and unknown sounds of the Germanic
dialect, and they ingeniously lamented that the trembling muses fled
from the harmony of a Burgundian lyre. The Gauls were endowed with all
the advantages of art and nature; but as they wanted courage to defend
them, they were justly condemned to obey, and even to flatter, the
victorious Barbarians, by whose clemency they held their precarious
fortunes and their lives. <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a>

[ Sidonius Apollinaris ridicules, with affected wit and
pleasantry, the hardships of his situation, (Carm. xii. in tom. i. p.
811.)]
</p>
<p>
As soon as Odoacer had extinguished the Western empire, he sought the
friendship of the most powerful of the Barbarians. The new sovereign of
Italy resigned to Euric, king of the Visigoths, all the Roman conquests
beyond the Alps, as far as the Rhine and the Ocean: <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> and the senate
might confirm this liberal gift with some ostentation of power, and
without any real loss of revenue and dominion. The lawful pretensions
of Euric were justified by ambition and success; and the Gothic nation
might aspire, under his command, to the monarchy of Spain and Gaul.
Arles and Marseilles surrendered to his arms: he oppressed the freedom
of Auvergne; and the bishop condescended to purchase his recall from
exile by a tribute of just, but reluctant praise. Sidonius waited before
the gates of the palace among a crowd of ambassadors and suppliants; and
their various business at the court of Bordeaux attested the power,
and the renown, of the king of the Visigoths. The Heruli of the distant
ocean, who painted their naked bodies with its coerulean color, implored
his protection; and the Saxons respected the maritime provinces of
a prince, who was destitute of any naval force. The tall Burgundians
submitted to his authority; nor did he restore the captive Franks, till
he had imposed on that fierce nation the terms of an unequal peace. The
Vandals of Africa cultivated his useful friendship; and the Ostrogoths
of Pannonia were supported by his powerful aid against the oppression of
the neighboring Huns. The North (such are the lofty strains of the poet)
was agitated or appeased by the nod of Euric; the great king of Persia
consulted the oracle of the West; and the aged god of the Tyber was
protected by the swelling genius of the Garonne. <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> The fortune of
nations has often depended on accidents; and France may ascribe her
greatness to the premature death of the Gothic king, at a time when
his son Alaric was a helpless infant, and his adversary Clovis <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> an
ambitious and valiant youth.

[ I use the familiar appellation of Clovis, from the Latin
Chlodovechus, or Chlodovoeus. But the Ch expresses only the German
aspiration, and the true name is not different from Lewis, (Mem. de
'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p. 68.)]
</p>
<p>
While Childeric, the father of Clovis, lived an exile in Germany, he
was hospitably entertained by the queen, as well as by the king, of the
Thuringians. After his restoration, Basina escaped from her husband's
bed to the arms of her lover; freely declaring, that if she had known a
man wiser, stronger, or more beautiful, than Childeric, that man should
have been the object of her preference. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> 
<a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a>
Clovis was the offspring
of this voluntary union; and, when he was no more than fifteen years of
age, he succeeded, by his father's death, to the command of the Salian
tribe. The narrow limits of his kingdom were confined to the island of
the Batavians, with the ancient dioceses of Tournay and Arras; <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> and
at the baptism of Clovis the number of his warriors could not exceed
five thousand. The kindred tribes of the Franks, who had seated
themselves along the Belgic rivers, the Scheld, the Meuse, the Moselle,
and the Rhine, were governed by their independent kings, of the
Merovingian race; the equals, the allies, and sometimes the enemies of
the Salic prince. But the Germans, who obeyed, in peace, the hereditary
jurisdiction of their chiefs, were free to follow the standard of
a popular and victorious general; and the superior merit of Clovis
attracted the respect and allegiance of the national confederacy. When
he first took the field, he had neither gold and silver in his coffers,
nor wine and corn in his magazine; <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> but he imitated the example of
Caesar, who, in the same country, had acquired wealth by the sword, and
purchased soldiers with the fruits of conquest. After each successful
battle or expedition, the spoils were accumulated in one common
mass; every warrior received his proportionable share; and the royal
prerogative submitted to the equal regulations of military law.
The untamed spirit of the Barbarians was taught to acknowledge the
advantages of regular discipline. <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> At the annual review of the month
of March, their arms were diligently inspected; and when they traversed
a peaceful territory, they were prohibited from touching a blade
of grass. The justice of Clovis was inexorable; and his careless or
disobedient soldiers were punished with instant death. It would be
superfluous to praise the valor of a Frank; but the valor of Clovis was
directed by cool and consummate prudence. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> In all his transactions
with mankind, he calculated the weight of interest, of passion, and
of opinion; and his measures were sometimes adapted to the sanguinary
manners of the Germans, and sometimes moderated by the milder genius
of Rome, and Christianity. He was intercepted in the career of victory,
since he died in the forty-fifth year of his age: but he had already
accomplished, in a reign of thirty years, the establishment of the
French monarchy in Gaul.

[ The duke of Nivernois, a noble statesman, who has managed

l'Acad. des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p. 147-184) the political system of

</p>
<p>
The first exploit of Clovis was the defeat of Syagrius, the son of
Aegidius; and the public quarrel might, on this occasion, be inflamed
by private resentment. The glory of the father still insulted the
Merovingian race; the power of the son might excite the jealous ambition
of the king of the Franks. Syagrius inherited, as a patrimonial estate,
the city and diocese of Soissons: the desolate remnant of the second
Belgic, Rheims and Troyes, Beauvais and Amiens, would naturally submit
to the count or patrician: <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> and after the dissolution of the Western
empire, he might reign with the title, or at least with the authority,
of king of the Romans. <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> As a Roman, he had been educated in the
liberal studies of rhetoric and jurisprudence; but he was engaged by
accident and policy in the familiar use of the Germanic idiom. The
independent Barbarians resorted to the tribunal of a stranger, who
possessed the singular talent of explaining, in their native tongue,
the dictates of reason and equity. The diligence and affability of their
judge rendered him popular, the impartial wisdom of his decrees obtained
their voluntary obedience, and the reign of Syagrius over the Franks and
Burgundians seemed to revive the original institution of civil society.
<a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> In the midst of these peaceful occupations, Syagrius received,
and boldly accepted, the hostile defiance of Clovis; who challenged his
rival in the spirit, and almost in the language, of chivalry, to appoint
the day and the field <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> of battle. In the time of Caesar Soissons
would have poured forth a body of fifty thousand horse and such an
army might have been plentifully supplied with shields, cuirasses, and
military engines, from the three arsenals or manufactures of the city.
<a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> But the courage and numbers of the Gallic youth were long since
exhausted; and the loose bands of volunteers, or mercenaries, who
marched under the standard of Syagrius, were incapable of contending
with the national valor of the Franks. It would be ungenerous without
some more accurate knowledge of his strength and resources, to condemn
the rapid flight of Syagrius, who escaped, after the loss of a battle,
to the distant court of Thoulouse. The feeble minority of Alaric could
not assist or protect an unfortunate fugitive; the pusillanimous <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a>
Goths were intimidated by the menaces of Clovis; and the Roman
king, after a short confinement, was delivered into the hands of the
executioner. The Belgic cities surrendered to the king of the Franks;
and his dominions were enlarged towards the East by the ample diocese of
Tongres <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> which Clovis subdued in the tenth year of his reign.

Eburones, and more recently the diocese of Liege.]
</p>
<p>
The name of the Alemanni has been absurdly derived from their imaginary
settlement on the banks of the Leman Lake. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> That fortunate district,
from the lake to the Avenche, and Mount Jura, was occupied by the
Burgundians. <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> The northern parts of Helvetia had indeed been subdued
by the ferocious Alemanni, who destroyed with their own hands the fruits
of their conquest. A province, improved and adorned by the arts of
Rome, was again reduced to a savage wilderness; and some vestige of the
stately Vindonissa may still be discovered in the fertile and populous
valley of the Aar. <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> From the source of the Rhine to its conflux
with the Mein and the Moselle, the formidable swarms of the Alemanni
commanded either side of the river, by the right of ancient possession,
or recent victory. They had spread themselves into Gaul, over the modern
provinces of Alsace and Lorraine; and their bold invasion of the kingdom
of Cologne summoned the Salic prince to the defence of his Ripuarian
allies.
</p>
<p>
Clovis encountered the invaders of Gaul in the plain of Tolbiac, about
twenty-four miles from Cologne; and the two fiercest nations of Germany
were mutually animated by the memory of past exploits, and the prospect
of future greatness. The Franks, after an obstinate struggle, gave way;
and the Alemanni, raising a shout of victory, impetuously pressed their
retreat. But the battle was restored by the valor, and the conduct, and
perhaps by the piety, of Clovis; and the event of the bloody day decided
forever the alternative of empire or servitude. The last king of the
Alemanni was slain in the field, and his people were slaughtered or
pursued, till they threw down their arms, and yielded to the mercy of
the conqueror. Without discipline it was impossible for them to rally:
they had contemptuously demolished the walls and fortifications which
might have protected their distress; and they were followed into the
heart of their forests by an enemy not less active, or intrepid, than
themselves. The great Theodoric congratulated the victory of Clovis,
whose sister Albofleda the king of Italy had lately married; but he
mildly interceded with his brother in favor of the suppliants and
fugitives, who had implored his protection. The Gallic territories,
which were possessed by the Alemanni, became the prize of their
conqueror; and the haughty nation, invincible, or rebellious, to the
arms of Rome, acknowledged the sovereignty of the Merovingian kings,
who graciously permitted them to enjoy their peculiar manners and
institutions, under the government of official, and, at length, of
hereditary, dukes. After the conquest of the Western provinces, the
Franks alone maintained their ancient habitations beyond the Rhine. They
gradually subdued, and civilized, the exhausted countries, as far as the
Elbe, and the mountains of Bohemia; and the peace of Europe was secured
by the obedience of Germany. <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a>

<p>
Till the thirtieth year of his age, Clovis continued to worship the
gods of his ancestors. <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> His disbelief, or rather disregard, of
Christianity, might encourage him to pillage with less remorse the
churches of a hostile territory: but his subjects of Gaul enjoyed the
free exercise of religious worship; and the bishops entertained a more
favorable hope of the idolater, than of the heretics. The Merovingian
prince had contracted a fortunate alliance with the fair Clotilda, the
niece of the king of Burgundy, who, in the midst of an Arian court, was
educated in the profession of the Catholic faith. It was her interest,
as well as her duty, to achieve the conversion <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> of a Pagan husband;
and Clovis insensibly listened to the voice of love and religion. He
consented (perhaps such terms had been previously stipulated) to the
baptism of his eldest son; and though the sudden death of the infant
excited some superstitious fears, he was persuaded, a second time,
to repeat the dangerous experiment. In the distress of the battle of
Tolbiac, Clovis loudly invoked the God of Clotilda and the Christians;
and victory disposed him to hear, with respectful gratitude, the
eloquent <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> Remigius, <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> bishop of Rheims, who forcibly displayed
the temporal and spiritual advantages of his conversion. The king
declared himself satisfied of the truth of the Catholic faith; and the
political reasons which might have suspended his public profession, were
removed by the devout or loyal acclamations of the Franks, who showed
themselves alike prepared to follow their heroic leader to the field of
battle, or to the baptismal font. The important ceremony was performed
in the cathedral of Rheims, with every circumstance of magnificence and
solemnity that could impress an awful sense of religion on the minds of
its rude proselytes. <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> The new Constantine was immediately baptized,
with three thousand of his warlike subjects; and their example was
imitated by the remainder of the gentle Barbarians, who, in obedience to
the victorious prelate, adored the cross which they had burnt, and burnt
the idols which they had formerly adored. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> The mind of Clovis was
susceptible of transient fervor: he was exasperated by the pathetic
tale of the passion and death of Christ; and, instead of weighing the
salutary consequences of that mysterious sacrifice, he exclaimed, with
indiscreet fury, "Had I been present at the head of my valiant Franks, I
would have revenged his injuries." <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> But the savage conqueror of Gaul
was incapable of examining the proofs of a religion, which depends
on the laborious investigation of historic evidence and speculative
theology. He was still more incapable of feeling the mild influence of
the gospel, which persuades and purifies the heart of a genuine convert.
His ambitious reign was a perpetual violation of moral and Christian
duties: his hands were stained with blood in peace as well as in war;
and, as soon as Clovis had dismissed a synod of the Gallican church, he
calmly assassinated all the princes of the Merovingian race. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> Yet
the king of the Franks might sincerely worship the Christian God, as
a Being more excellent and powerful than his national deities; and the
signal deliverance and victory of Tolbiac encouraged Clovis to confide
in the future protection of the Lord of Hosts. Martin, the most popular
of the saints, had filled the Western world with the fame of those
miracles which were incessantly performed at his holy sepulchre of
Tours. His visible or invisible aid promoted the cause of a liberal
and orthodox prince; and the profane remark of Clovis himself, that
St.Martin was an expensive friend, <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> need not be interpreted as the
symptom of any permanent or rational scepticism. But earth, as well as
heaven, rejoiced in the conversion of the Franks. On the memorable day
when Clovis ascended from the baptismal font, he alone, in the Christian
world, deserved the name and prerogatives of a Catholic king. The
emperor Anastasius entertained some dangerous errors concerning the
nature of the divine incarnation; and the Barbarians of Italy, Africa,
Spain, and Gaul, were involved in the Arian heresy. The eldest, or
rather the only, son of the church, was acknowledged by the clergy as
their lawful sovereign, or glorious deliverer; and the armies of Clovis
were strenuously supported by the zeal and fervor of the Catholic
faction. <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a>

<p>
Under the Roman empire, the wealth and jurisdiction of the bishops,
their sacred character, and perpetual office, their numerous dependants,
popular eloquence, and provincial assemblies, had rendered them always
respectable, and sometimes dangerous. Their influence was augmented
with the progress of superstition; and the establishment of the French
monarchy may, in some degree, be ascribed to the firm alliance of a
hundred prelates, who reigned in the discontented, or independent,
cities of Gaul. The slight foundations of the Armorican republic had
been repeatedly shaken, or overthrown; but the same people still guarded
their domestic freedom; asserted the dignity of the Roman name; and
bravely resisted the predatory inroads, and regular attacks, of Clovis,
who labored to extend his conquests from the Seine to the Loire. Their
successful opposition introduced an equal and honorable union. The
Franks esteemed the valor of the Armoricans <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> and the Armoricans were
reconciled by the religion of the Franks. The military force which
had been stationed for the defence of Gaul, consisted of one hundred
different bands of cavalry or infantry; and these troops, while they
assumed the title and privileges of Roman soldiers, were renewed by an
incessant supply of the Barbarian youth. The extreme fortifications, and
scattered fragments of the empire, were still defended by their hopeless
courage. But their retreat was intercepted, and their communication
was impracticable: they were abandoned by the Greek princes of
Constantinople, and they piously disclaimed all connection with the
Arian usurpers of Gaul. They accepted, without shame or reluctance, the
generous capitulation, which was proposed by a Catholic hero; and this
spurious, or legitimate, progeny of the Roman legions, was distinguished
in the succeeding age by their arms, their ensigns, and their peculiar
dress and institutions. But the national strength was increased by these
powerful and voluntary accessions; and the neighboring kingdoms dreaded
the numbers, as well as the spirit, of the Franks. The reduction of the
Northern provinces of Gaul, instead of being decided by the chance of
a single battle, appears to have been slowly effected by the gradual
operation of war and treaty and Clovis acquired each object of his
ambition, by such efforts, or such concessions, as were adequate to its
real value. His savage character, and the virtues of Henry IV., suggest
the most opposite ideas of human nature; yet some resemblance may be
found in the situation of two princes, who conquered France by their
valor, their policy, and the merits of a seasonable conversion. <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a>

the number of royal candidates by the death of two brothers, one of
whom was the father of Clotilda; <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> but his imperfect prudence still
permitted Godegesil, the youngest of his brothers, to possess the
dependent principality of Geneva. The Arian monarch was justly alarmed
by the satisfaction, and the hopes, which seemed to animate his clergy
and people after the conversion of Clovis; and Gundobald convened at
Lyons an assembly of his bishops, to reconcile, if it were possible,
their religious and political discontents. A vain conference was
agitated between the two factions. The Arians upbraided the Catholics
with the worship of three Gods: the Catholics defended their cause
by theological distinctions; and the usual arguments, objections, and
replies were reverberated with obstinate clamor; till the king revealed
his secret apprehensions, by an abrupt but decisive question, which he
addressed to the orthodox bishops. "If you truly profess the Christian
religion, why do you not restrain the king of the Franks? He has
declared war against me, and forms alliances with my enemies for my
destruction. A sanguinary and covetous mind is not the symptom of a
sincere conversion: let him show his faith by his works." The answer
of Avitus, bishop of Vienna, who spoke in the name of his brethren, was
delivered with the voice and countenance of an angel. "We are ignorant
of the motives and intentions of the king of the Franks: but we are
taught by Scripture, that the kingdoms which abandon the divine law are
frequently subverted; and that enemies will arise on every side against
those who have made God their enemy. Return, with thy people, to the law
of God, and he will give peace and security to thy dominions." The king
of Burgundy, who was not prepared to accept the condition which the
Catholics considered as essential to the treaty, delayed and dismissed
the ecclesiastical conference; after reproaching his bishops, that
Clovis, their friend and proselyte, had privately tempted the allegiance
of his brother. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a>

</h2>
<p>
The allegiance of his brother was already seduced; and the obedience of
Godegesil, who joined the royal standard with the troops of Geneva, more
effectually promoted the success of the conspiracy. While the Franks and
Burgundians contended with equal valor, his seasonable desertion decided
the event of the battle; and as Gundobald was faintly supported by
the disaffected Gauls, he yielded to the arms of Clovis, and hastily
retreated from the field, which appears to have been situate between
Langres and Dijon. He distrusted the strength of Dijon, a quadrangular
fortress, encompassed by two rivers, and by a wall thirty feet high,
and fifteen thick, with four gates, and thirty-three towers: <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> he
abandoned to the pursuit of Clovis the important cities of Lyons and
Vienna; and Gundobald still fled with precipitation, till he had reached
Avignon, at the distance of two hundred and fifty miles from the field
of battle.
</p>
<p>
A long siege and an artful negotiation, admonished the king of the
Franks of the danger and difficulty of his enterprise. He imposed a
tribute on the Burgundian prince, compelled him to pardon and reward his
brother's treachery, and proudly returned to his own dominions, with the
spoils and captives of the southern provinces. This splendid triumph was
soon clouded by the intelligence, that Gundobald had violated his recent
obligations, and that the unfortunate Godegesil, who was left at
Vienna with a garrison of five thousand Franks, <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> had been besieged,
surprised, and massacred by his inhuman brother. Such an outrage might
have exasperated the patience of the most peaceful sovereign; yet the
conqueror of Gaul dissembled the injury, released the tribute, and
accepted the alliance, and military service, of the king of Burgundy.
Clovis no longer possessed those advantages which had assured the
success of the preceding war; and his rival, instructed by adversity,
had found new resources in the affections of his people. The Gauls or
Romans applauded the mild and impartial laws of Gundobald, which almost
raised them to the same level with their conquerors. The bishops were
reconciled, and flattered, by the hopes, which he artfully suggested, of
his approaching conversion; and though he eluded their accomplishment
to the last moment of his life, his moderation secured the peace, and
suspended the ruin, of the kingdom of Burgundy. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a>

I am impatient to pursue the final ruin of that kingdom, which was
accomplished under the reign of Sigismond, the son of Gundobald. The
Catholic Sigismond has acquired the honors of a saint and martyr; <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a>
but the hands of the royal saint were stained with the blood of his
innocent son, whom he inhumanly sacrificed to the pride and resentment
of a step-mother. He soon discovered his error, and bewailed the
irreparable loss. While Sigismond embraced the corpse of the unfortunate
youth, he received a severe admonition from one of his attendants:
"It is not his situation, O king! it is thine which deserves pity and
lamentation." The reproaches of a guilty conscience were alleviated,
however, by his liberal donations to the monastery of Agaunum, or
St. Maurice, in Vallais; which he himself had founded in honor of
the imaginary martyrs of the Thebaean legion. <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> A full chorus of
perpetual psalmody was instituted by the pious king; he assiduously
practised the austere devotion of the monks; and it was his humble
prayer, that Heaven would inflict in this world the punishment of his
sins. His prayer was heard: the avengers were at hand: and the provinces
of Burgundy were overwhelmed by an army of victorious Franks. After the
event of an unsuccessful battle, Sigismond, who wished to protract his
life that he might prolong his penance, concealed himself in the
desert in a religious habit, till he was discovered and betrayed by
his subjects, who solicited the favor of their new masters. The captive
monarch, with his wife and two children, was transported to Orleans, and
buried alive in a deep well, by the stern command of the sons of Clovis;
whose cruelty might derive some excuse from the maxims and examples of
their barbarous age. Their ambition, which urged them to achieve the
conquest of Burgundy, was inflamed, or disguised, by filial piety: and
Clotilda, whose sanctity did not consist in the forgiveness of injuries,
pressed them to revenge her father's death on the family of his
assassin. The rebellious Burgundians (for they attempted to break their
chains) were still permitted to enjoy their national laws under the
obligation of tribute and military service; and the Merovingian princes
peaceably reigned over a kingdom, whose glory and greatness had been
first overthrown by the arms of Clovis. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a>

The first victory of Clovis had insulted the honor of the Goths. They
viewed his rapid progress with jealousy and terror; and the youthful
fame of Alaric was oppressed by the more potent genius of his rival.
Some disputes inevitably arose on the edge of their contiguous
dominions; and after the delays of fruitless negotiation, a personal
interview of the two kings was proposed and accepted. The conference of
Clovis and Alaric was held in a small island of the Loire, near Amboise.
They embraced, familiarly conversed, and feasted together; and separated
with the warmest professions of peace and brotherly love. But
their apparent confidence concealed a dark suspicion of hostile and
treacherous designs; and their mutual complaints solicited, eluded, and
disclaimed, a final arbitration. At Paris, which he already considered
as his royal seat, Clovis declared to an assembly of the princes and
warriors, the pretence, and the motive, of a Gothic war. "It grieves me
to see that the Arians still possess the fairest portion of Gaul. Let
us march against them with the aid of God; and, having vanquished the
heretics, we will possess and divide their fertile provinces." <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> The
Franks, who were inspired by hereditary valor and recent zeal, applauded
the generous design of their monarch; expressed their resolution to
conquer or die, since death and conquest would be equally profitable;
and solemnly protested that they would never shave their beards till
victory should absolve them from that inconvenient vow. The enterprise
was promoted by the public or private exhortations of Clotilda. She
reminded her husband how effectually some pious foundation would
propitiate the Deity, and his servants: and the Christian hero, darting
his battle-axe with a skilful and nervous band, "There, (said he,) on
that spot where my Francisca, <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> shall fall, will I erect a church
in honor of the holy apostles." This ostentatious piety confirmed
and justified the attachment of the Catholics, with whom he secretly
corresponded; and their devout wishes were gradually ripened into
a formidable conspiracy. The people of Aquitain were alarmed by the
indiscreet reproaches of their Gothic tyrants, who justly accused them
of preferring the dominion of the Franks: and their zealous adherent
Quintianus, bishop of Rodez, <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> preached more forcibly in his exile
than in his diocese. To resist these foreign and domestic enemies, who
were fortified by the alliance of the Burgundians, Alaric collected
his troops, far more numerous than the military powers of Clovis. The
Visigoths resumed the exercise of arms, which they had neglected in
a long and luxurious peace; <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> a select band of valiant and robust
slaves attended their masters to the field; <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> and the cities of Gaul
were compelled to furnish their doubtful and reluctant aid. Theodoric,
king of the Ostrogoths, who reigned in Italy, had labored to maintain
the tranquillity of Gaul; and he assumed, or affected, for that purpose,
the impartial character of a mediator. But the sagacious monarch dreaded
the rising empire of Clovis, and he was firmly engaged to support the
national and religious cause of the Goths.

The accidental, or artificial, prodigies which adorned the expedition
of Clovis, were accepted by a superstitious age, as the manifest
declaration of the divine favor. He marched from Paris; and as he
proceeded with decent reverence through the holy diocese of Tours, his
anxiety tempted him to consult the shrine of St. Martin, the sanctuary
and the oracle of Gaul. His messengers were instructed to remark the
words of the Psalm which should happen to be chanted at the precise
moment when they entered the church. Those words most fortunately
expressed the valor and victory of the champions of Heaven, and the
application was easily transferred to the new Joshua, the new Gideon,
who went forth to battle against the enemies of the Lord. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> Orleans
secured to the Franks a bridge on the Loire; but, at the distance
of forty miles from Poitiers, their progress was intercepted by an
extraordinary swell of the River Vigenna or Vienne; and the opposite
banks were covered by the encampment of the Visigoths. Delay must be
always dangerous to Barbarians, who consume the country through which
they march; and had Clovis possessed leisure and materials, it might
have been impracticable to construct a bridge, or to force a passage,
in the face of a superior enemy. But the affectionate peasants who were
impatient to welcome their deliverer, could easily betray some unknown
or unguarded ford: the merit of the discovery was enhanced by the useful
interposition of fraud or fiction; and a white hart, of singular size
and beauty, appeared to guide and animate the march of the Catholic
army. The counsels of the Visigoths were irresolute and distracted.
A crowd of impatient warriors, presumptuous in their strength, and
disdaining to fly before the robbers of Germany, excited Alaric to
assert in arms the name and blood of the conquerors of Rome. The advice
of the graver chieftains pressed him to elude the first ardor of the
Franks; and to expect, in the southern provinces of Gaul, the veteran
and victorious Ostrogoths, whom the king of Italy had already sent to
his assistance. The decisive moments were wasted in idle deliberation
the Goths too hastily abandoned, perhaps, an advantageous post; and the
opportunity of a secure retreat was lost by their slow and disorderly
motions. After Clovis had passed the ford, as it is still named, of the
Hart, he advanced with bold and hasty steps to prevent the escape of the
enemy. His nocturnal march was directed by a flaming meteor, suspended
in the air above the cathedral of Poitiers; and this signal, which might
be previously concerted with the orthodox successor of St. Hilary, was
compared to the column of fire that guided the Israelites in the desert.
At the third hour of the day, about ten miles beyond Poitiers, Clovis
overtook, and instantly attacked, the Gothic army; whose defeat was
already prepared by terror and confusion. Yet they rallied in their
extreme distress, and the martial youths, who had clamorously demanded
the battle, refused to survive the ignominy of flight. The two kings
encountered each other in single combat. Alaric fell by the hand of
his rival; and the victorious Frank was saved by the goodness of his
cuirass, and the vigor of his horse, from the spears of two desperate
Goths, who furiously rode against him to revenge the death of their
sovereign. The vague expression of a mountain of the slain, serves to
indicate a cruel though indefinite slaughter; but Gregory has carefully
observed, that his valiant countryman Apollinaris, the son of Sidonius,
lost his life at the head of the nobles of Auvergne. Perhaps these
suspected Catholics had been maliciously exposed to the blind assault
of the enemy; and perhaps the influence of religion was superseded by
personal attachment or military honor. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a>

the banks of the Clain, about ten miles to the south of Poitiers. Clovis

Such is the empire of Fortune, (if we may still disguise our ignorance
under that popular name,) that it is almost equally difficult to foresee
the events of war, or to explain their various consequences. A bloody
and complete victory has sometimes yielded no more than the possession
of the field and the loss of ten thousand men has sometimes been
sufficient to destroy, in a single day, the work of ages. The decisive
battle of Poitiers was followed by the conquest of Aquitain. Alaric had
left behind him an infant son, a bastard competitor, factious nobles,
and a disloyal people; and the remaining forces of the Goths were
oppressed by the general consternation, or opposed to each other in
civil discord. The victorious king of the Franks proceeded without delay
to the siege of Angouleme. At the sound of his trumpets the walls of the
city imitated the example of Jericho, and instantly fell to the ground;
a splendid miracle, which may be reduced to the supposition, that
some clerical engineers had secretly undermined the foundations of
the rampart. <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> At Bordeaux, which had submitted without resistance,
Clovis established his winter quarters; and his prudent economy
transported from Thoulouse the royal treasures, which were deposited
in the capital of the monarchy. The conqueror penetrated as far as the
confines of Spain; <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> restored the honors of the Catholic church;
fixed in Aquitain a colony of Franks; <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> and delegated to his
lieutenants the easy task of subduing, or extirpating, the nation of
the Visigoths. But the Visigoths were protected by the wise and powerful
monarch of Italy. While the balance was still equal, Theodoric had
perhaps delayed the march of the Ostrogoths; but their strenuous efforts
successfully resisted the ambition of Clovis; and the army of the
Franks, and their Burgundian allies, was compelled to raise the siege
of Arles, with the loss, as it is said, of thirty thousand men. These
vicissitudes inclined the fierce spirit of Clovis to acquiesce in an
advantageous treaty of peace. The Visigoths were suffered to retain the
possession of Septimania, a narrow tract of sea-coast, from the Rhone to
the Pyrenees; but the ample province of Aquitain, from those mountains
to the Loire, was indissolubly united to the kingdom of France. <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a>

After the success of the Gothic war, Clovis accepted the honors of the
Roman consulship. The emperor Anastasius ambitiously bestowed on the
most powerful rival of Theodoric the title and ensigns of that eminent
dignity; yet, from some unknown cause, the name of Clovis has not been
inscribed in the Fasti either of the East or West. <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> On the solemn
day, the monarch of Gaul, placing a diadem on his head, was invested, in
the church of St. Martin, with a purple tunic and mantle. From thence
he proceeded on horseback to the cathedral of Tours; and, as he passed
through the streets, profusely scattered, with his own hand, a donative
of gold and silver to the joyful multitude, who incessantly repeated
their acclamations of Consul and Augustus. The actual or legal authority
of Clovis could not receive any new accessions from the consular
dignity. It was a name, a shadow, an empty pageant; and if the conqueror
had been instructed to claim the ancient prerogatives of that high
office, they must have expired with the period of its annual duration.
But the Romans were disposed to revere, in the person of their master,
that antique title which the emperors condescended to assume: the
Barbarian himself seemed to contract a sacred obligation to respect the
majesty of the republic; and the successors of Theodosius, by soliciting
his friendship, tacitly forgave, and almost ratified, the usurpation of
Gaul.

[ The Fasti of Italy would naturally reject a consul,

Marcellinus, and the Paschal,) is overturned by the similar silence
of Marius, bishop of Avenche, who composed his Fasti in the kingdom
of Burgundy. If the evidence of Gregory of Tours were less weighty
and positive, (l. ii. c. 38, in tom. ii. p. 183,) I could believe
that Clovis, like Odoacer, received the lasting title and honors of
Patrician, (Pagi Critica, tom. ii. p. 474, 492.)]
</p>
<p>
Twenty-five years after the death of Clovis this important concession
was more formally declared, in a treaty between his sons and the emperor
Justinian. The Ostrogoths of Italy, unable to defend their distant
acquisitions, had resigned to the Franks the cities of Arles and
Marseilles; of Arles, still adorned with the seat of a Praetorian
praefect, and of Marseilles, enriched by the advantages of trade
and navigation. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> This transaction was confirmed by the Imperial
authority; and Justinian, generously yielding to the Franks the
sovereignty of the countries beyond the Alps, which they already
possessed, absolved the provincials from their allegiance; and
established on a more lawful, though not more solid, foundation, the
throne of the Merovingians. <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> From that era they enjoyed the right
of celebrating at Arles the games of the circus; and by a singular
privilege, which was denied even to the Persian monarch, the gold coin,
impressed with their name and image, obtained a legal currency in the
empire. <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> A Greek historian of that age has praised the private and
public virtues of the Franks, with a partial enthusiasm, which cannot
be sufficiently justified by their domestic annals. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> He celebrates
their politeness and urbanity, their regular government, and
orthodox religion; and boldly asserts, that these Barbarians could be
distinguished only by their dress and language from the subjects of
Rome. Perhaps the Franks already displayed the social disposition, and
lively graces, which, in every age, have disguised their vices, and
sometimes concealed their intrinsic merit. Perhaps Agathias, and the
Greeks, were dazzled by the rapid progress of their arms, and the
splendor of their empire. Since the conquest of Burgundy, Gaul, except
the Gothic province of Septimania, was subject, in its whole extent,
to the sons of Clovis. They had extinguished the German kingdom of
Thuringia, and their vague dominion penetrated beyond the Rhine, into
the heart of their native forests. The Alemanni, and Bavarians, who had
occupied the Roman provinces of Rhaetia and Noricum, to the south of the
Danube, confessed themselves the humble vassals of the Franks; and the
feeble barrier of the Alps was incapable of resisting their ambition.
When the last survivor of the sons of Clovis united the inheritance
and conquests of the Merovingians, his kingdom extended far beyond the
limits of modern France. Yet modern France, such has been the progress
of arts and policy, far surpasses, in wealth, populousness, and power,
the spacious but savage realms of Clotaire or Dagobert. <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a>

The Franks, or French, are the only people of Europe who can deduce
a perpetual succession from the conquerors of the Western empire. But
their conquest of Gaul was followed by ten centuries of anarchy and
ignorance. On the revival of learning, the students, who had been formed
in the schools of Athens and Rome, disdained their Barbarian ancestors;
and a long period elapsed before patient labor could provide the
requisite materials to satisfy, or rather to excite, the curiosity
of more enlightened times. <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> At length the eye of criticism
and philosophy was directed to the antiquities of France; but even
philosophers have been tainted by the contagion of prejudice and
passion. The most extreme and exclusive systems, of the personal
servitude of the Gauls, or of their voluntary and equal alliance with
the Franks, have been rashly conceived, and obstinately defended; and
the intemperate disputants have accused each other of conspiring against
the prerogative of the crown, the dignity of the nobles, or the freedom
of the people. Yet the sharp conflict has usefully exercised the
adverse powers of learning and genius; and each antagonist, alternately
vanquished and victorious has extirpated some ancient errors, and
established some interesting truths. An impartial stranger, instructed
by their discoveries, their disputes, and even their faults, may
describe, from the same original materials, the state of the Roman
provincials, after Gaul had submitted to the arms and laws of the

The rudest, or the most servile,
condition of human society, is regulated, however, by some fixed and
general rules. When Tacitus surveyed the primitive simplicity of the
Germans, he discovered some permanent maxims, or customs, of public
and private life, which were preserved by faithful tradition till the
introduction of the art of writing, and of the Latin tongue. <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> Before
the election of the Merovingian kings, the most powerful tribe, or
nation, of the Franks, appointed four venerable chieftains to compose
the Salic laws; <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> and their labors were examined and approved in
three successive assemblies of the people. After the baptism of
Clovis, he reformed several articles that appeared incompatible with
Christianity: the Salic law was again amended by his sons; and
at length, under the reign of Dagobert, the code was revised
and promulgated in its actual form, one hundred years after the
establishment of the French monarchy. Within the same period,
the customs of the Ripuarians were transcribed and published; and
Charlemagne himself, the legislator of his age and country, had
accurately studied the two national laws, which still prevailed among
the Franks. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> The same care was extended to their vassals; and the
rude institutions of the Alemanni and Bavarians were diligently compiled
and ratified by the supreme authority of the Merovingian kings. The
Visigoths and Burgundians, whose conquests in Gaul preceded those of the
Franks, showed less impatience to attain one of the principal benefits
of civilized society. Euric was the first of the Gothic princes who
expressed, in writing, the manners and customs of his people; and the
composition of the Burgundian laws was a measure of policy rather than
of justice; to alleviate the yoke, and regain the affections, of their
Gallic subjects. <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> Thus, by a singular coincidence, the Germans
framed their artless institutions, at a time when the elaborate system
of Roman jurisprudence was finally consummated. In the Salic laws, and
the Pandects of Justinian, we may compare the first rudiments, and the
full maturity, of civil wisdom; and whatever prejudices may be suggested
in favor of Barbarism, our calmer reflections will ascribe to the Romans
the superior advantages, not only of science and reason, but of humanity
and justice. Yet the laws <a href="#note-681" name="noteref-681"><small>681</small></a> of the Barbarians were adapted to their
wants and desires, their occupations and their capacity; and they all
contributed to preserve the peace, and promote the improvement, of
the society for whose use they were originally established. The
Merovingians, instead of imposing a uniform rule of conduct on their
various subjects, permitted each people, and each family, of their
empire, freely to enjoy their domestic institutions; <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> nor were the
Romans excluded from the common benefits of this legal toleration. <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a>
The children embraced the law of their parents, the wife that of her
husband, the freedman that of his patron; and in all causes where the
parties were of different nations, the plaintiff or accuser was obliged
to follow the tribunal of the defendant, who may always plead a judicial
presumption of right, or innocence. A more ample latitude was allowed,
if every citizen, in the presence of the judge, might declare the law
under which he desired to live, and the national society to which
he chose to belong. Such an indulgence would abolish the partial
distinctions of victory: and the Roman provincials might patiently
acquiesce in the hardships of their condition; since it depended
on themselves to assume the privilege, if they dared to assert the
character, of free and warlike Barbarians. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a>

[ Latin appears to have been the original language of
the Salic law. It was probably composed in the beginning of the fifth
century, before the era (A.D. 421) of the real or fabulous Pharamond.
The preface mentions the four cantons which produced the four
legislators; and many provinces, Franconia, Saxony, Hanover, Brabant,
&amp;c., have claimed them as their own. See an excellent Dissertation of
Heinecties de Lege Salica, tom. iii. Sylloge iii. p. 247-267. * Note:
The relative antiquity of the two copies of the Salic law has been
contested with great learning and ingenuity. The work of M. Wiarda,
History and Explanation of the Salic Law, Bremen, 1808, asserts that
what is called the Lex Antiqua, or Vetustior in which many German words
are mingled with the Latin, has no claim to superior antiquity, and may
be suspected to be more modern. M. Wiarda has been opposed by M. Fuer
bach, who maintains the higher age of the "ancient" Code, which has been
greatly corrupted by the transcribers. See Guizot, Cours de l'Histoire
Moderne, vol. i. sect. 9: and the preface to the useful republication of
five of the different texts of the Salic law, with that of the Ripuarian

<h2>
    Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
When justice inexorably requires the death of a murderer, each private
citizen is fortified by the assurance, that the laws, the magistrate,
and the whole community, are the guardians of his personal safety. But
in the loose society of the Germans, revenge was always honorable, and
often meritorious: the independent warrior chastised, or vindicated,
with his own hand, the injuries which he had offered or received; and he
had only to dread the resentment of the sons and kinsmen of the enemy,
whom he had sacrificed to his selfish or angry passions. The magistrate,
conscious of his weakness, interposed, not to punish, but to reconcile;
and he was satisfied if he could persuade or compel the contending
parties to pay and to accept the moderate fine which had been
ascertained as the price of blood. <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> The fierce spirit of the
Franks would have opposed a more rigorous sentence; the same fierceness
despised these ineffectual restraints; and, when their simple manners
had been corrupted by the wealth of Gaul, the public peace was
continually violated by acts of hasty or deliberate guilt. In every just
government the same penalty is inflicted, or at least is imposed,
for the murder of a peasant or a prince. But the national inequality
established by the Franks, in their criminal proceedings, was the last
insult and abuse of conquest. <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> In the calm moments of legislation,
they solemnly pronounced, that the life of a Roman was of smaller value
than that of a Barbarian. The Antrustion, <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> a name expressive of the
most illustrious birth or dignity among the Franks, was appreciated at
the sum of six hundred pieces of gold; while the noble provincial,
who was admitted to the king's table, might be legally murdered at the
expense of three hundred pieces.
</p>
<p>
Two hundred were deemed sufficient for a Frank of ordinary condition;
but the meaner Romans were exposed to disgrace and danger by a trifling
compensation of one hundred, or even fifty, pieces of gold. Had these
laws been regulated by any principle of equity or reason, the public
protection should have supplied, in just proportion, the want of
personal strength. But the legislator had weighed in the scale, not of
justice, but of policy, the loss of a soldier against that of a slave:
the head of an insolent and rapacious Barbarian was guarded by a
heavy fine; and the slightest aid was afforded to the most defenceless
subjects. Time insensibly abated the pride of the conquerors and the
patience of the vanquished; and the boldest citizen was taught, by
experience, that he might suffer more injuries than he could inflict.
As the manners of the Franks became less ferocious, their laws were
rendered more severe; and the Merovingian kings attempted to imitate the
impartial rigor of the Visigoths and Burgundians. <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> Under the empire
of Charlemagne, murder was universally punished with death; and the
use of capital punishments has been liberally multiplied in the
jurisprudence of modern Europe. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a>

The civil and military professions, which had been separated by
Constantine, were again united by the Barbarians. The harsh sound of the
Teutonic appellations was mollified into the Latin titles of Duke,
of Count, or of Praefect; and the same officer assumed, within his
district, the command of the troops, and the administration of justice.
<a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> But the fierce and illiterate chieftain was seldom qualified to
discharge the duties of a judge, which required all the faculties of a
philosophic mind, laboriously cultivated by experience and study; and
his rude ignorance was compelled to embrace some simple, and visible,
methods of ascertaining the cause of justice. In every religion, the
Deity has been invoked to confirm the truth, or to punish the falsehood
of human testimony; but this powerful instrument was misapplied and
abused by the simplicity of the German legislators. The party accused
might justify his innocence, by producing before their tribunal a number
of friendly witnesses, who solemnly declared their belief, or assurance,
that he was not guilty. According to the weight of the charge, this
legal number of compurgators was multiplied; seventy-two voices were
required to absolve an incendiary or assassin: and when the chastity
of a queen of France was suspected, three hundred gallant nobles swore,
without hesitation, that the infant prince had been actually begotten by
her deceased husband. <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> The sin and scandal of manifest and frequent
perjuries engaged the magistrates to remove these dangerous temptations;
and to supply the defects of human testimony by the famous experiments
of fire and water. These extraordinary trials were so capriciously
contrived, that, in some cases, guilt, and innocence in others, could
not be proved without the interposition of a miracle. Such miracles were
really provided by fraud and credulity; the most intricate causes
were determined by this easy and infallible method, and the turbulent
Barbarians, who might have disdained the sentence of the magistrate,
submissively acquiesced in the judgment of God. <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a>

in civil and criminal proceedings, the plaintiff, or accuser, the

the antagonist who was destitute of legal proofs; and it was incumbent

horseback, according to the custom of their nation; <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> and the
decision of the sword, or lance, was ratified by the sanction of Heaven,
of the judge, and of the people. This sanguinary law was introduced
into Gaul by the Burgundians; and their legislator Gundobald <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a>
condescended to answer the complaints and objections of his subject
Avitus. "Is it not true," said the king of Burgundy to the bishop, "that
the event of national wars, and private combats, is directed by the
judgment of God; and that his providence awards the victory to the
juster cause?" By such prevailing arguments, the absurd and cruel
practice of judicial duels, which had been peculiar to some tribes of
Germany, was propagated and established in all the monarchies of Europe,
from Sicily to the Baltic. At the end of ten centuries, the reign
of legal violence was not totally extinguished; and the ineffectual
censures of saints, of popes, and of synods, may seem to prove, that
the influence of superstition is weakened by its unnatural alliance with
reason and humanity. The tribunals were stained with the blood, perhaps,
of innocent and respectable citizens; the law, which now favors the
rich, then yielded to the strong; and the old, the feeble, and the
infirm, were condemned, either to renounce their fairest claims and
possessions, to sustain the dangers of an unequal conflict, <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> or
to trust the doubtful aid of a mercenary champion. This oppressive
jurisprudence was imposed on the provincials of Gaul, who complained
of any injuries in their persons and property. Whatever might be the
strength, or courage, of individuals, the victorious Barbarians excelled
in the love and exercise of arms; and the vanquished Roman was unjustly
summoned to repeat, in his own person, the bloody contest which had been
already decided against his country. <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a>

A devouring host of one hundred and twenty thousand Germans had formerly
passed the Rhine under the command of Ariovistus. One third part of
the fertile lands of the Sequani was appropriated to their use; and the
conqueror soon repeated his oppressive demand of another third, for the
accommodation of a new colony of twenty-four thousand Barbarians, whom
he had invited to share the rich harvest of Gaul. <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> At the distance
of five hundred years, the Visigoths and Burgundians, who revenged the
defeat of Ariovistus, usurped the same unequal proportion of two thirds
of the subject lands. But this distribution, instead of spreading over
the province, may be reasonably confined to the peculiar districts where
the victorious people had been planted by their own choice, or by the
policy of their leader. In these districts, each Barbarian was connected
by the ties of hospitality with some Roman provincial. To this unwelcome
guest, the proprietor was compelled to abandon two thirds of his
patrimony, but the German, a shepherd and a hunter, might sometimes
content himself with a spacious range of wood and pasture, and resign
the smallest, though most valuable, portion, to the toil of the
industrious husbandman. <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> The silence of ancient and authentic
testimony has encouraged an opinion, that the rapine of the Franks was
not moderated, or disguised, by the forms of a legal division; that
they dispersed themselves over the provinces of Gaul, without order or
control; and that each victorious robber, according to his wants, his
avarice, and his strength, measured with his sword the extent of his new
inheritance. At a distance from their sovereign, the Barbarians might
indeed be tempted to exercise such arbitrary depredation; but the firm
and artful policy of Clovis must curb a licentious spirit, which would
aggravate the misery of the vanquished, whilst it corrupted the union
and discipline of the conquerors. <a href="#note-861" name="noteref-861"><small>861</small></a> The memorable vase of Soissons
is a monument and a pledge of the regular distribution of the Gallic
spoils. It was the duty and the interest of Clovis to provide rewards
for a successful army, settlements for a numerous people; without
inflicting any wanton or superfluous injuries on the loyal Catholics of
Gaul. The ample fund, which he might lawfully acquire, of the Imperial
patrimony, vacant lands, and Gothic usurpations, would diminish the
cruel necessity of seizure and confiscation, and the humble provincials
would more patiently acquiesce in the equal and regular distribution of
their loss. <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a>

The wealth of the Merovingian princes consisted in their extensive
domain. After the conquest of Gaul, they still delighted in the rustic
simplicity of their ancestors; the cities were abandoned to solitude
and decay; and their coins, their charters, and their synods, are still
inscribed with the names of the villas, or rural palaces, in which they
successively resided.
</p>
<p>
One hundred and sixty of these palaces, a title which need not excite
any unseasonable ideas of art or luxury, were scattered through the
provinces of their kingdom; and if some might claim the honors of a
fortress, the far greater part could be esteemed only in the light of
profitable farms. The mansion of the long-haired kings was surrounded
with convenient yards and stables, for the cattle and the poultry;
the garden was planted with useful vegetables; the various trades, the
labors of agriculture, and even the arts of hunting and fishing, were
exercised by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign;
his magazines were filled with corn and wine, either for sale or
consumption; and the whole administration was conducted by the strictest
maxims of private economy. <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> This ample patrimony was appropriated to
supply the hospitable plenty of Clovis and his successors; and to reward
the fidelity of their brave companions who, both in peace and war,
were devoted to their persona service. Instead of a horse, or a suit of
armor, each companion, according to his rank, or merit, or favor, was
invested with a benefice, the primitive name, and most simple form, of
the feudal possessions. These gifts might be resumed at the pleasure of
the sovereign; and his feeble prerogative derived some support from
the influence of his liberality. <a href="#note-881" name="noteref-881"><small>881</small></a> But this dependent tenure was

In the bloody discord and silent decay of the Merovingian line, a new
order of tyrants arose in the provinces, who, under the appellation of
Seniors, or Lords, usurped a right to govern, and a license to oppress,
the subjects of their peculiar territory. Their ambition might be
checked by the hostile resistance of an equal: but the laws were
extinguished; and the sacrilegious Barbarians, who dared to provoke the
vengeance of a saint or bishop, <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> would seldom respect the landmarks
of a profane and defenceless neighbor. The common or public rights of
nature, such as they had always been deemed by the Roman jurisprudence,
<a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> were severely restrained by the German conquerors, whose amusement,
or rather passion, was the exercise of hunting. The vague dominion which
Man has assumed over the wild inhabitants of the earth, the air, and the
waters, was confined to some fortunate individuals of the human species.
Gaul was again overspread with woods; and the animals, who were reserved
for the use or pleasure of the lord, might ravage with impunity the
fields of his industrious vassals. The chase was the sacred privilege
of the nobles and their domestic servants. Plebeian transgressors were
legally chastised with stripes and imprisonment; <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> but in an age
which admitted a slight composition for the life of a citizen, it was a

According to the maxims of ancient war, the conqueror became the
lawful master of the enemy whom he had subdued and spared: <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> and the
fruitful cause of personal slavery, which had been almost suppressed by
the peaceful sovereignty of Rome, was again revived and multiplied by
the perpetual hostilities of the independent Barbarians. The Goth, the
Burgundian, or the Frank, who returned from a successful expedition,
dragged after him a long train of sheep, of oxen, and of human captives,
whom he treated with the same brutal contempt. The youths of an elegant
form and an ingenuous aspect were set apart for the domestic service; a
doubtful situation, which alternately exposed them to the favorable or
cruel impulse of passion. The useful mechanics and servants (smiths,
carpenters, tailors, shoemakers, cooks, gardeners, dyers, and workmen
in gold and silver, &amp;c.) employed their skill for the use, or profit,
of their master. But the Roman captives, who were destitute of art, but
capable of labor, were condemned, without regard to their former rank,
to tend the cattle and cultivate the lands of the Barbarians. The number
of the hereditary bondsmen, who were attached to the Gallic estates, was
continually increased by new supplies; and the servile people, according
to the situation and temper of their lords, was sometimes raised by
precarious indulgence, and more frequently depressed by capricious
despotism. <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> An absolute power of life and death was exercised by
these lords; and when they married their daughters, a train of useful
servants, chained on the wagons to prevent their escape, was sent as a
nuptial present into a distant country. <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> The majesty of the Roman
laws protected the liberty of each citizen, against the rash effects of
his own distress or despair. But the subjects of the Merovingian kings
might alienate their personal freedom; and this act of legal suicide,
which was familiarly practised, is expressed in terms most disgraceful
and afflicting to the dignity of human nature. <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> The example of the
poor, who purchased life by the sacrifice of all that can render life
desirable, was gradually imitated by the feeble and the devout, who, in
times of public disorder, pusillanimously crowded to shelter themselves
under the battlements of a powerful chief, and around the shrine of
a popular saint. Their submission was accepted by these temporal or
spiritual patrons; and the hasty transaction irrecoverably fixed their
own condition, and that of their latest posterity. From the reign of
Clovis, during five successive centuries, the laws and manners of Gaul
uniformly tended to promote the increase, and to confirm the duration,
of personal servitude. Time and violence almost obliterated the
intermediate ranks of society; and left an obscure and narrow interval
between the noble and the slave. This arbitrary and recent division has
been transformed by pride and prejudice into a national distinction,
universally established by the arms and the laws of the Merovingians.
The nobles, who claimed their genuine or fabulous descent from the
independent and victorious Franks, have asserted and abused the
indefeasible right of conquest over a prostrate crowd of slaves and
plebeians, to whom they imputed the imaginary disgrace of Gallic or
Roman extraction.

The general state and revolutions of France, a name which was imposed
by the conquerors, may be illustrated by the particular example of
a province, a diocese, or a senatorial family. Auvergne had formerly
maintained a just preeminence among the independent states and cities
of Gaul. The brave and numerous inhabitants displayed a singular trophy;
the sword of Caesar himself, which he had lost when he was repulsed
before the walls of Gergovia. <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> As the common offspring of Troy,
they claimed a fraternal alliance with the Romans; <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> and if each
province had imitated the courage and loyalty of Auvergne, the fall of
the Western empire might have been prevented or delayed. They firmly
maintained the fidelity which they had reluctantly sworn to the
Visigoths, out when their bravest nobles had fallen in the battle of
Poitiers, they accepted, without resistance, a victorious and Catholic
sovereign. This easy and valuable conquest was achieved and possessed
by Theodoric, the eldest son of Clovis: but the remote province was
separated from his Austrasian dominions, by the intermediate kingdoms of
Soissons, Paris, and Orleans, which formed, after their father's death,
the inheritance of his three brothers. The king of Paris, Childebert,
was tempted by the neighborhood and beauty of Auvergne. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> The
Upper country, which rises towards the south into the mountains of the
Cevennes, presented a rich and various prospect of woods and pastures;
the sides of the hills were clothed with vines; and each eminence was
crowned with a villa or castle. In the Lower Auvergne, the River
Allier flows through the fair and spacious plain of Limagne; and the
inexhaustible fertility of the soil supplied, and still supplies,
without any interval of repose, the constant repetition of the same
harvests. <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> On the false report, that their lawful sovereign had
been slain in Germany, the city and diocese of Auvergne were betrayed
by the grandson of Sidonius Apollinaris. Childebert enjoyed this
clandestine victory; and the free subjects of Theodoric threatened to
desert his standard, if he indulged his private resentment, while the
nation was engaged in the Burgundian war. But the Franks of Austrasia
soon yielded to the persuasive eloquence of their king. "Follow me,"
said Theodoric, "into Auvergne; I will lead you into a province, where
you may acquire gold, silver, slaves, cattle, and precious apparel,
to the full extent of your wishes. I repeat my promise; I give you the
people and their wealth as your prey; and you may transport them at
pleasure into your own country." By the execution of this promise,
Theodoric justly forfeited the allegiance of a people whom he devoted
to destruction. His troops, reenforced by the fiercest Barbarians of
Germany, <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> spread desolation over the fruitful face of Auvergne;
and two places only, a strong castle and a holy shrine, were saved or
redeemed from their licentious fury. The castle of Meroliac <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> was
seated on a lofty rock, which rose a hundred feet above the surface of
the plain; and a large reservoir of fresh water was enclosed, with some
arable lands, within the circle of its fortifications. The Franks beheld
with envy and despair this impregnable fortress; but they surprised a
party of fifty stragglers; and, as they were oppressed by the number
of their captives, they fixed, at a trifling ransom, the alternative of
life or death for these wretched victims, whom the cruel Baroarians were
prepared to massacre on the refusal of the garrison. Another detachment
penetrated as far as Brivas, or Brioude, where the inhabitants, with
their valuable effects, had taken refuge in the sanctuary of St. Julian.
The doors of the church resisted the assault; but a daring soldier
entered through a window of the choir, and opened a passage to his
companions. The clergy and people, the sacred and the profane spoils,
were rudely torn from the altar; and the sacrilegious division was made
at a small distance from the town of Brioude. But this act of impiety
was severely chastised by the devout son of Clovis. He punished with
death the most atrocious offenders; left their secret accomplices to the
vengeance of St. Julian; released the captives; restored the plunder;
and extended the rights of sanctuary five miles round the sepulchre of
the holy martyr. <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
Before the Austrasian army retreated from Auvergne, Theodoric exacted
some pledges of the future loyalty of a people, whose just hatred could
be restrained only by their fear. A select band of noble youths, the
sons of the principal senators, was delivered to the conqueror, as the
hostages of the faith of Childebert, and of their countrymen. On the
first rumor of war, or conspiracy, these guiltless youths were
reduced to a state of servitude; and one of them, Attalus, <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a> whose
adventures are more particularly related, kept his master's horses in
the diocese of Treves. After a painful search, he was discovered, in
this unworthy occupation, by the emissaries of his grandfather, Gregory
bishop of Langres; but his offers of ransom were sternly rejected by the
avarice of the Barbarian, who required an exorbitant sum of ten pounds
of gold for the freedom of his noble captive. His deliverance was
effected by the hardy stratagem of Leo, an item belonging to the
kitchens of the bishop of Langres. <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> An unknown agent easily
introduced him into the same family. The Barbarian purchased Leo for
the price of twelve pieces of gold; and was pleased to learn that he was
deeply skilled in the luxury of an episcopal table: "Next Sunday," said
the Frank, "I shall invite my neighbors and kinsmen. Exert thy art, and
force them to confess, that they have never seen, or tasted, such an
entertainment, even in the king's house." Leo assured him, that if he
would provide a sufficient quantity of poultry, his wishes should
be satisfied. The master who already aspired to the merit of elegant
hospitality, assumed, as his own, the praise which the voracious guests
unanimously bestowed on his cook; and the dexterous Leo insensibly
acquired the trust and management of his household. After the patient
expectation of a whole year, he cautiously whispered his design to
Attalus, and exhorted him to prepare for flight in the ensuing night. At
the hour of midnight, the intemperate guests retired from the table;
and the Frank's son-in-law, whom Leo attended to his apartment with a
nocturnal potation, condescended to jest on the facility with which
he might betray his trust. The intrepid slave, after sustaining this
dangerous raillery, entered his master's bedchamber; removed his spear
and shield; silently drew the fleetest horses from the stable; unbarred
the ponderous gates; and excited Attalus to save his life and liberty
by incessant diligence. Their apprehensions urged them to leave their
horses on the banks of the Meuse; <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> they swam the river, wandered
three days in the adjacent forest, and subsisted only by the accidental
discovery of a wild plum-tree. As they lay concealed in a dark thicket,
they heard the noise of horses; they were terrified by the angry
countenance of their master, and they anxiously listened to his
declaration, that, if he could seize the guilty fugitives, one of them
he would cut in pieces with his sword, and would expose the other on
a gibbet. A length, Attalus and his faithful Leo reached the friendly
habitation of a presbyter of Rheims, who recruited their fainting
strength with bread and wine, concealed them from the search of their
enemy, and safely conducted them beyond the limits of the Austrasian
kingdom, to the episcopal palace of Langres. Gregory embraced his
grandson with tears of joy, gratefully delivered Leo, with his whole
family, from the yoke of servitude, and bestowed on him the property of
a farm, where he might end his days in happiness and freedom. Perhaps
this singular adventure, which is marked with so many circumstances
of truth and nature, was related by Attalus himself, to his cousin or
nephew, the first historian of the Franks. Gregory of Tours <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> was
born about sixty years after the death of Sidonius Apollinaris; and
their situation was almost similar, since each of them was a native of
Auvergne, a senator, and a bishop. The difference of their style and
sentiments may, therefore, express the decay of Gaul; and clearly
ascertain how much, in so short a space, the human mind had lost of its
energy and refinement. <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a>

and, perhaps, artful, misrepresentations, which have softened, or
exaggerated, the oppression of the Romans of Gaul under the reign of the
Merovingians. The conquerors never promulgated any universal edict of
servitude, or confiscation; but a degenerate people, who excused their
weakness by the specious names of politeness and peace, was exposed
to the arms and laws of the ferocious Barbarians, who contemptuously
insulted their possessions, their freedom, and their safety. Their
personal injuries were partial and irregular; but the great body of the
Romans survived the revolution, and still preserved the property, and
privileges, of citizens. A large portion of their lands was exacted
for the use of the Franks: but they enjoyed the remainder, exempt from
tribute; <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> and the same irresistible violence which swept away the
arts and manufactures of Gaul, destroyed the elaborate and expensive
system of Imperial despotism. The Provincials must frequently deplore
the savage jurisprudence of the Salic or Ripuarian laws; but their
private life, in the important concerns of marriage, testaments,
or inheritance, was still regulated by the Theodosian Code; and a
discontented Roman might freely aspire, or descend, to the title and
character of a Barbarian. The honors of the state were accessible to
his ambition: the education and temper of the Romans more peculiarly
qualified them for the offices of civil government; and, as soon as
emulation had rekindled their military ardor, they were permitted to
march in the ranks, or even at the head, of the victorious Germans. I
shall not attempt to enumerate the generals and magistrates, whose names
<a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> attest the liberal policy of the Merovingians. The supreme command
of Burgundy, with the title of Patrician, was successively intrusted
to three Romans; and the last, and most powerful, Mummolus, <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> who
alternately saved and disturbed the monarchy, had supplanted his father
in the station of count of Autun, and left a treasury of thirty talents
of gold, and two hundred and fifty talents of silver. The fierce and
illiterate Barbarians were excluded, during several generations, from
the dignities, and even from the orders, of the church. <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> The clergy
of Gaul consisted almost entirely of native provincials; the haughty
Franks fell at the feet of their subjects, who were dignified with the
episcopal character: and the power and riches which had been lost in
war, were insensibly recovered by superstition. <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> In all temporal
affairs, the Theodosian Code was the universal law of the clergy; but
the Barbaric jurisprudence had liberally provided for their personal
safety; a sub-deacon was equivalent to two Franks; the antrustion, and
priest, were held in similar estimation: and the life of a bishop was
appreciated far above the common standard, at the price of nine hundred
pieces of gold. <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> The Romans communicated to their conquerors
the use of the Christian religion and Latin language; <a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a> but their
language and their religion had alike degenerated from the simple purity
of the Augustan, and Apostolic age. The progress of superstition and
Barbarism was rapid and universal: the worship of the saints concealed
from vulgar eyes the God of the Christians; and the rustic dialect
of peasants and soldiers was corrupted by a Teutonic idiom and
pronunciation. Yet such intercourse of sacred and social communion
eradicated the distinctions of birth and victory; and the nations of
Gaul were gradually confounded under the name and government of the
Franks.

The Franks, after they mingled with their Gallic subjects, might have
imparted the most valuable of human gifts, a spirit and system of
constitutional liberty. Under a king, hereditary, but limited, the
chiefs and counsellors might have debated at Paris, in the palace of the
Caesars: the adjacent field, where the emperors reviewed their mercenary
legions. would have admitted the legislative assembly of freemen and
warriors; and the rude model, which had been sketched in the woods of
Germany, <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a> might have been polished and improved by the civil wisdom
of the Romans. But the careless Barbarians, secure of their personal
independence, disdained the labor of government: the annual assemblies
of the month of March were silently abolished; and the nation was
separated, and almost dissolved, by the conquest of Gaul. <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> The
monarchy was left without any regular establishment of justice, of arms,
or of revenue. The successors of Clovis wanted resolution to assume, or
strength to exercise, the legislative and executive powers, which the
people had abdicated: the royal prerogative was distinguished only by a
more ample privilege of rapine and murder; and the love of freedom, so
often invigorated and disgraced by private ambition, was reduced, among
the licentious Franks, to the contempt of order, and the desire of
impunity. Seventy-five years after the death of Clovis, his grandson,
Gontran, king of Burgundy, sent an army to invade the Gothic possessions
of Septimania, or Languedoc. The troops of Burgundy, Berry, Auvergne,
and the adjacent territories, were excited by the hopes of spoil. They
marched, without discipline, under the banners of German, or Gallic,
counts: their attack was feeble and unsuccessful; but the friendly
and hostile provinces were desolated with indiscriminate rage. The
cornfields, the villages, the churches themselves, were consumed by
fire: the inhabitants were massacred, or dragged into captivity; and,
in the disorderly retreat, five thousand of these inhuman savages
were destroyed by hunger or intestine discord. When the pious Gontran
reproached the guilt or neglect of their leaders, and threatened to
inflict, not a legal sentence, but instant and arbitrary execution, they
accused the universal and incurable corruption of the people. "No one,"
they said, "any longer fears or respects his king, his duke, or his
count. Each man loves to do evil, and freely indulges his criminal
inclinations. The most gentle correction provokes an immediate tumult,
and the rash magistrate, who presumes to censure or restrain his
seditious subjects, seldom escapes alive from their revenge." <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a> It
has been reserved for the same nation to expose, by their intemperate
vices, the most odious abuse of freedom; and to supply its loss by the

obedience to an absolute sovereign. <a href="#note-1211" name="noteref-1211"><small>1211</small></a>

The Visigoths had resigned to Clovis the greatest part of their Gallic
possessions; but their loss was amply compensated by the easy conquest,
and secure enjoyment, of the provinces of Spain. From the monarchy
of the Goths, which soon involved the Suevic kingdom of Gallicia, the
modern Spaniards still derive some national vanity; but the historian
of the Roman empire is neither invited, nor compelled, to pursue the
obscure and barren series of their annals. <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> The Goths of Spain were
separated from the rest of mankind by the lofty ridge of the Pyrenaean
mountains: their manners and institutions, as far as they were common to
the Germanic tribes, have been already explained. I have anticipated,

events, the fall of Arianism, and the persecution of the Jews; and it

the civil and ecclesiastical constitution of the Spanish kingdom.

unfortunate. The Franks had a Gregory of Tours; the Saxons, or Angles,
a Bede; the Lombards, a Paul Warnefrid, &amp;c. But the history of the
Visigoths is contained in the short and imperfect Chronicles of Isidore
of Seville and John of Biclar] 
</p>
<p>
After their conversion from idolatry or
heresy, the Frank and the Visigoths were disposed to embrace, with
equal submission, the inherent evils and the accidental benefits, of
superstition. But the prelates of France, long before the extinction
of the Merovingian race, had degenerated into fighting and hunting
Barbarians. They disdained the use of synods; forgot the laws of
temperance and chastity; and preferred the indulgence of private
ambition and luxury to the general interest of the sacerdotal
profession. <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a> The bishops of Spain respected themselves, and were
respected by the public: their indissoluble union disguised their vices,
and confirmed their authority; and the regular discipline of the church
introduced peace, order, and stability, into the government of the
state. From the reign of Recared, the first Catholic king, to that of
Witiza, the immediate predecessor of the unfortunate Roderic, sixteen
national councils were successively convened. The six metropolitans,
Toledo, Seville, Merida, Braga, Tarragona, and Narbonne, presided
according to their respective seniority; the assembly was composed of
their suffragan bishops, who appeared in person, or by their proxies;
and a place was assigned to the most holy, or opulent, of the Spanish
abbots. During the first three days of the convocation, as long as they
agitated the ecclesiastical question of doctrine and discipline, the
profane laity was excluded from their debates; which were conducted,
however, with decent solemnity. But, on the morning of the fourth day,
the doors were thrown open for the entrance of the great officers of the
palace, the dukes and counts of the provinces, the judges of the cities,
and the Gothic nobles, and the decrees of Heaven were ratified by the
consent of the people.
</p>
<p>
The same rules were observed in the provincial assemblies, the annual
synods, which were empowered to hear complaints, and to redress
grievances; and a legal government was supported by the prevailing
influence of the Spanish clergy. The bishops, who, in each revolution,
were prepared to flatter the victorious, and to insult the prostrate
labored, with diligence and success, to kindle the flames of
persecution, and to exalt the mitre above the crown. Yet the national
councils of Toledo, in which the free spirit of the Barbarians was
tempered and guided by episcopal policy, have established some prudent
laws for the common benefit of the king and people. The vacancy of the
throne was supplied by the choice of the bishops and palatines; and
after the failure of the line of Alaric, the regal dignity was still
limited to the pure and noble blood of the Goths. The clergy, who
anointed their lawful prince, always recommended, and sometimes
practised, the duty of allegiance; and the spiritual censures were
denounced on the heads of the impious subjects, who should resist his
authority, conspire against his life, or violate, by an indecent
union, the chastity even of his widow. But the monarch himself, when
he ascended the throne, was bound by a reciprocal oath to God and his
people, that he would faithfully execute this important trust. The real
or imaginary faults of his administration were subject to the control of
a powerful aristocracy; and the bishops and palatines were guarded by
a fundamental privilege, that they should not be degraded, imprisoned,
tortured, nor punished with death, exile, or confiscation, unless by the
free and public judgment of their peers. <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a>

</p>
<p>
One of these legislative councils of Toledo examined and ratified the
code of laws which had been compiled by a succession of Gothic kings,
from the fierce Euric, to the devout Egica. As long as the Visigoths
themselves were satisfied with the rude customs of their ancestors, they
indulged their subjects of Aquitain and Spain in the enjoyment of the
Roman law. Their gradual improvement in arts, in policy, and at length
in religion, encouraged them to imitate, and to supersede, these foreign
institutions; and to compose a code of civil and criminal jurisprudence,
for the use of a great and united people. The same obligations, and
the same privileges, were communicated to the nations of the Spanish
monarchy; and the conquerors, insensibly renouncing the Teutonic idiom,
submitted to the restraints of equity, and exalted the Romans to
the participation of freedom. The merit of this impartial policy was
enhanced by the situation of Spain under the reign of the Visigoths.
The provincials were long separated from their Arian masters by the
irreconcilable difference of religion. After the conversion of Recared
had removed the prejudices of the Catholics, the coasts, both of the
Ocean and Mediterranean, were still possessed by the Eastern emperors;
who secretly excited a discontented people to reject the yoke of the
Barbarians, and to assert the name and dignity of Roman citizens. The
allegiance of doubtful subjects is indeed most effectually secured by
their own persuasion, that they hazard more in a revolt, than they
can hope to obtain by a revolution; but it has appeared so natural
to oppress those whom we hate and fear, that the contrary system well
deserves the praise of wisdom and moderation. <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a>

While the kingdom of the Franks and Visigoths were established in Gaul
and Spain, the Saxons achieved the conquest of Britain, the third
great diocese of the Praefecture of the West. Since Britain was already
separated from the Roman empire, I might, without reproach, decline a
story familiar to the most illiterate, and obscure to the most learned,
of my readers. The Saxons, who excelled in the use of the oar, or the
battle-axe, were ignorant of the art which could alone perpetuate the
fame of their exploits; the Provincials, relapsing into barbarism,
neglected to describe the ruin of their country; and the doubtful
tradition was almost extinguished, before the missionaries of Rome
restored the light of science and Christianity. The declamations of
Gildas, the fragments, or fables, of Nennius, the obscure hints of the
Saxon laws and chronicles, and the ecclesiastical tales of the venerable
Bede, <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> have been illustrated by the diligence, and sometimes
embellished by the fancy, of succeeding writers, whose works I am not

<p>
About forty years after the dissolution of the Roman government,
Vortigern appears to have obtained the supreme, though precarious
command of the princes and cities of Britain. That unfortunate monarch
has been almost unanimously condemned for the weak and mischievous
policy of inviting <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> a formidable stranger, to repel the vexatious
inroads of a domestic foe. His ambassadors are despatched, by the
gravest historians, to the coast of Germany: they address a pathetic
oration to the general assembly of the Saxons, and those warlike
Barbarians resolve to assist with a fleet and army the suppliants of a
distant and unknown island. If Britain had indeed been unknown to the
Saxons, the measure of its calamities would have been less complete. But
the strength of the Roman government could not always guard the maritime
province against the pirates of Germany; the independent and divided
states were exposed to their attacks; and the Saxons might sometimes
join the Scots and the Picts, in a tacit, or express, confederacy of
rapine and destruction. Vortigern could only balance the various perils,
which assaulted on every side his throne and his people; and his policy
may deserve either praise or excuse, if he preferred the alliance of
those Barbarians, whose naval power rendered them the most dangerous
enemies and the most serviceable allies. Hengist and Horsa, as they
ranged along the Eastern coast with three ships, were engaged, by the
promise of an ample stipend, to embrace the defence of Britain; and
their intrepid valor soon delivered the country from the Caledonian
invaders. The Isle of Thanet, a secure and fertile district, was
allotted for the residence of these German auxiliaries, and they
were supplied, according to the treaty, with a plentiful allowance
of clothing and provisions. This favorable reception encouraged five
thousand warriors to embark with their families in seventeen vessels,
and the infant power of Hengist was fortified by this strong and
seasonable reenforcement. The crafty Barbarian suggested to Vortigern
the obvious advantage of fixing, in the neighborhood of the Picts,
a colony of faithful allies: a third fleet of forty ships, under the
command of his son and nephew, sailed from Germany, ravaged the Orkneys,
and disembarked a new army on the coast of Northumberland, or Lothian,
at the opposite extremity of the devoted land. It was easy to foresee,
but it was impossible to prevent, the impending evils. The two nations
were soon divided and exasperated by mutual jealousies. The Saxons
magnified all that they had done and suffered in the cause of an
ungrateful people; while the Britons regretted the liberal rewards which
could not satisfy the avarice of those haughty mercenaries. The causes
of fear and hatred were inflamed into an irreconcilable quarrel. The
Saxons flew to arms; and if they perpetrated a treacherous massacre
during the security of a feast, they destroyed the reciprocal confidence
which sustains the intercourse of peace and war. <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a>

Hengist, who boldly aspired to the conquest of Britain, exhorted his
countrymen to embrace the glorious opportunity: he painted in lively
colors the fertility of the soil, the wealth of the cities, the
pusillanimous temper of the natives, and the convenient situation of a
spacious solitary island, accessible on all sides to the Saxon fleets.
The successive colonies which issued, in the period of a century, from
the mouths of the Elbe, the Weser, and the Rhine, were principally
composed of three valiant tribes or nations of Germany; the Jutes, the
old Saxons, and the Angles. The Jutes, who fought under the peculiar
banner of Hengist, assumed the merit of leading their countrymen in the
paths of glory, and of erecting, in Kent, the first independent kingdom.
The fame of the enterprise was attributed to the primitive Saxons; and
the common laws and language of the conquerors are described by the
national appellation of a people, which, at the end of four hundred
years, produced the first monarchs of South Britain. The Angles were
distinguished by their numbers and their success; and they claimed the
honor of fixing a perpetual name on the country, of which they occupied
the most ample portion. The Barbarians, who followed the hopes of rapine
either on the land or sea, were insensibly blended with this triple
confederacy; the Frisians, who had been tempted by their vicinity to the
British shores, might balance, during a short space, the strength and
reputation of the native Saxons; the Danes, the Prussians, the Rugians,
are faintly described; and some adventurous Huns, who had wandered as
far as the Baltic, might embark on board the German vessels, for the
conquest of a new world. <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> But this arduous achievement was not
prepared or executed by the union of national powers. Each intrepid
chieftain, according to the measure of his fame and fortunes, assembled
his followers; equipped a fleet of three, or perhaps of sixty, vessels;
chose the place of the attack; and conducted his subsequent operations
according to the events of the war, and the dictates of his private
interest. In the invasion of Britain many heroes vanquished and fell;
but only seven victorious leaders assumed, or at least maintained, the
title of kings. Seven independent thrones, the Saxon Heptarchy, <a href="#note-1301" name="noteref-1301"><small>1301</small></a>
were founded by the conquerors, and seven families, one of which has
been continued, by female succession, to our present sovereign, derived
their equal and sacred lineage from Woden, the god of war. It has

A monk, who, in the profound ignorance of human life, has presumed to
exercise the office of historian, strangely disfigures the state of
Britain at the time of its separation from the Western empire. Gildas
<a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a> describes in florid language the improvements of agriculture,
the foreign trade which flowed with every tide into the Thames and the
Severn the solid and lofty construction of public and private edifices;
he accuses the sinful luxury of the British people; of a people,
according to the same writer, ignorant of the most simple arts, and
incapable, without the aid of the Romans, of providing walls of stone,
or weapons of iron, for the defence of their native land. <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> Under
the long dominion of the emperors, Britain had been insensibly moulded
into the elegant and servile form of a Roman province, whose safety
was intrusted to a foreign power. The subjects of Honorius contemplated
their new freedom with surprise and terror; they were left destitute of
any civil or military constitution; and their uncertain rulers wanted
either skill, or courage, or authority, to direct the public force
against the common enemy. The introduction of the Saxons betrayed their
internal weakness, and degraded the character both of the prince and
people. Their consternation magnified the danger; the want of union
diminished their resources; and the madness of civil factions was more
solicitous to accuse, than to remedy, the evils, which they imputed to
the misconduct of their adversaries.
</p>
<p>
Yet the Britons were not ignorant, they could not be ignorant, of the
manufacture or the use of arms; the successive and disorderly attacks
of the Saxons allowed them to recover from their amazement, and the
prosperous or adverse events of the war added discipline and experience
to their native valor.

and important events]

<p>
While the continent of Europe and Africa yielded, without resistance,
to the Barbarians, the British island, alone and unaided, maintained
a long, a vigorous, though an unsuccessful, struggle, against the
formidable pirates, who, almost at the same instant, assaulted the
Northern, the Eastern, and the Southern coasts. The cities which had
been fortified with skill, were defended with resolution; the advantages
of ground, hills, forests, and morasses, were diligently improved by the
inhabitants; the conquest of each district was purchased with blood; and
the defeats of the Saxons are strongly attested by the discreet silence
of their annalist. Hengist might hope to achieve the conquest of
Britain; but his ambition, in an active reign of thirty-five years, was
confined to the possession of Kent; and the numerous colony which he had
planted in the North, was extirpated by the sword of the Britons. The
monarchy of the West Saxons was laboriously founded by the persevering
efforts of three martial generations. The life of Cerdic, one of the
bravest of the children of Woden, was consumed in the conquest of
Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight; and the loss which he sustained in
the battle of Mount Badon, reduced him to a state of inglorious repose.
Kenric, his valiant son, advanced into Wiltshire; besieged Salisbury, at
that time seated on a commanding eminence; and vanquished an army
which advanced to the relief of the city. In the subsequent battle of
Marlborough, <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a> his British enemies displayed their military science.
Their troops were formed in three lines; each line consisted of three
distinct bodies, and the cavalry, the archers, and the pikemen, were
distributed according to the principles of Roman tactics. The Saxons
charged in one weighty column, boldly encountered with their shord
swords the long lances of the Britons, and maintained an equal conflict
till the approach of night. Two decisive victories, the death of three
British kings, and the reduction of Cirencester, Bath, and Gloucester,
established the fame and power of Ceaulin, the grandson of Cerdic, who
carried his victorious arms to the banks of the Severn.

might consult some materials that no longer exist.] After a war of a
hundred years, the independent Britons still occupied the whole
extent of the Western coast, from the wall of Antoninus to the extreme
promontory of Cornwall; and the principal cities of the inland country
still opposed the arms of the Barbarians. Resistance became more
languid, as the number and boldness of the assailants continually
increased. Winning their way by slow and painful efforts, the Saxons,
the Angles, and their various confederates, advanced from the North,
from the East, and from the South, till their victorious banners were
united in the centre of the island. Beyond the Severn the Britons still
asserted their national freedom, which survived the heptarchy, and even
the monarchy, of the Saxons. The bravest warriors, who preferred
exile to slavery, found a secure refuge in the mountains of Wales: the
reluctant submission of Cornwall was delayed for some ages; <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a> and a
band of fugitives acquired a settlement in Gaul, by their own valor,
or the liberality of the Merovingian kings. <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a> The Western angle
of Armorica acquired the new appellations of Cornwall, and the Lesser

people, who, under the authority of their counts and bishops, preserved
the laws and language of their ancestors. To the feeble descendants of
Clovis and Charlemagne, the Britons of Armorica refused the customary
tribute, subdued the neighboring dioceses of Vannes, Rennes, and Nantes,
and formed a powerful, though vassal, state, which has been united to
the crown of France. <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>
<p>
In a century of perpetual, or at least implacable, war, much courage,
and some skill, must have been exerted for the defence of Britain. Yet
if the memory of its champions is almost buried in oblivion, we need
not repine; since every age, however destitute of science or virtue,
sufficiently abounds with acts of blood and military renown. The tomb
of Vortimer, the son of Vortigern, was erected on the margin of the
sea-shore, as a landmark formidable to the Saxons, whom he had thrice
vanquished in the fields of Kent. Ambrosius Aurelian was descended from
a noble family of Romans; <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a> his modesty was equal to his valor, and
his valor, till the last fatal action, <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a> was crowned with splendid
success. But every British name is effaced by the illustrious name of
Arthur, <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a> the hereditary prince of the Silures, in South Wales,
and the elective king or general of the nation. According to the most
rational account, he defeated, in twelve successive battles, the Angles
of the North, and the Saxons of the West; but the declining age of the
hero was imbittered by popular ingratitude and domestic misfortunes. The
events of his life are less interesting than the singular revolutions
of his fame. During a period of five hundred years the tradition of his
exploits was preserved, and rudely embellished, by the obscure bards of
Wales and Armorica, who were odious to the Saxons, and unknown to
the rest of mankind. The pride and curiosity of the Norman conquerors
prompted them to inquire into the ancient history of Britain: they
listened with fond credulity to the tale of Arthur, and eagerly
applauded the merit of a prince who had triumphed over the Saxons, their
common enemies. His romance, transcribed in the Latin of Jeffrey of
Monmouth, and afterwards translated into the fashionable idiom of the
times, was enriched with the various, though incoherent, ornaments which
were familiar to the experience, the learning, or the fancy, of the
twelfth century. The progress of a Phrygian colony, from the Tyber to
the Thames, was easily ingrafted on the fable of the Aeneid; and the
royal ancestors of Arthur derived their origin from Troy, and claimed
their alliance with the Caesars. His trophies were decorated with
captive provinces and Imperial titles; and his Danish victories avenged
the recent injuries of his country. The gallantry and superstition
of the British hero, his feasts and tournaments, and the memorable
institution of his Knights of the Round Table, were faithfully copied
from the reigning manners of chivalry; and the fabulous exploits of
Uther's son appear less incredible than the adventures which were
achieved by the enterprising valor of the Normans. Pilgrimage, and
the holy wars, introduced into Europe the specious miracles of Arabian
magic. Fairies and giants, flying dragons, and enchanted palaces, were
blended with the more simple fictions of the West; and the fate of
Britain depended on the art, or the predictions, of Merlin. Every nation
embraced and adorned the popular romance of Arthur, and the Knights of
the Round Table: their names were celebrated in Greece and Italy; and
the voluminous tales of Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram were devoutly
studied by the princes and nobles, who disregarded the genuine heroes
and historians of antiquity. At length the light of science and reason
was rekindled; the talisman was broken; the visionary fabric melted into
air; and by a natural, though unjust, reverse of the public opinion,
the severity of the present age is inclined to question the existence of
Arthur. <a href="#note-141" name="noteref-141"><small>141</small></a>

Resistance, if it cannot avert, must increase the
miseries of conquest; and conquest has never appeared more dreadful
and destructive than in the hands of the Saxons; who hated the valor of
their enemies, disdained the faith of treaties, and violated, without
remorse, the most sacred objects of the Christian worship. The fields of
battle might be traced, almost in every district, by monuments of bones;
the fragments of falling towers were stained with blood; the last of the
Britons, without distinction of age or sex, was massacred, <a href="#note-142" name="noteref-142"><small>142</small></a> in
the ruins of Anderida; <a href="#note-143" name="noteref-143"><small>143</small></a> and the repetition of such calamities was
frequent and familiar under the Saxon heptarchy. The arts and religion,
the laws and language, which the Romans had so carefully planted in
Britain, were extirpated by their barbarous successors. After the
destruction of the principal churches, the bishops, who had declined
the crown of martyrdom, retired with the holy relics into Wales and
Armorica; the remains of their flocks were left destitute of any
spiritual food; the practice, and even the remembrance, of Christianity
were abolished; and the British clergy might obtain some comfort
from the damnation of the idolatrous strangers. The kings of France
maintained the privileges of their Roman subjects; but the ferocious
Saxons trampled on the laws of Rome, and of the emperors. The
proceedings of civil and criminal jurisdiction, the titles of honor, the
forms of office, the ranks of society, and even the domestic rights of
marriage, testament, and inheritance, were finally suppressed; and the
indiscriminate crowd of noble and plebeian slaves was governed by the
traditionary customs, which had been coarsely framed for the shepherds
and pirates of Germany. The language of science, of business, and of
conversation, which had been introduced by the Romans, was lost in the
general desolation. A sufficient number of Latin or Celtic words might
be assumed by the Germans, to express their new wants and ideas; <a href="#note-144" name="noteref-144"><small>144</small></a>
but those illiterate Pagans preserved and established the use of their
national dialect. <a href="#note-145" name="noteref-145"><small>145</small></a> Almost every name, conspicuous either in the
church or state, reveals its Teutonic origin; <a href="#note-146" name="noteref-146"><small>146</small></a> and the geography
of England was universally inscribed with foreign characters and
appellations. The example of a revolution, so rapid and so complete, may
not easily be found; but it will excite a probable suspicion, that the
arts of Rome were less deeply rooted in Britain than in Gaul or Spain;
and that the native rudeness of the country and its inhabitants was
covered by a thin varnish of Italian manners.

This strange alteration has persuaded historians, and even philosophers,
that the provincials of Britain were totally exterminated; and that
the vacant land was again peopled by the perpetual influx, and rapid
increase, of the German colonies. Three hundred thousand Saxons are said
to have obeyed the summons of Hengist; <a href="#note-147" name="noteref-147"><small>147</small></a> the entire emigation of the
Angles was attested, in the age of Bede, by the solitude of their native
country; <a href="#note-148" name="noteref-148"><small>148</small></a> and our experience has shown the free propagation of the
human race, if they are cast on a fruitful wilderness, where their steps
are unconfined, and their subsistence is plentiful. The Saxon kingdoms
displayed the face of recent discovery and cultivation; the towns
were small, the villages were distant; the husbandry was languid and
unskilful; four sheep were equivalent to an acre of the best land; <a href="#note-149" name="noteref-149"><small>149</small></a>
an ample space of wood and morass was resigned to the vague dominion of
nature; and the modern bishopric of Durham, the whole territory from the
Tyne to the Tees, had returned to its primitive state of a savage
and solitary forest. <a href="#note-150" name="noteref-150"><small>150</small></a> Such imperfect population might have been
supplied, in some generations, by the English colonies; but neither
reason nor facts can justify the unnatural supposition, that the Saxons
of Britain remained alone in the desert which they had subdued. After
the sanguinary Barbarians had secured their dominion, and gratified
their revenge, it was their interest to preserve the peasants as well as
the cattle, of the unresisting country. In each successive revolution,
the patient herd becomes the property of its new masters; and the
salutary compact of food and labor is silently ratified by their mutual
necessities. Wilfrid, the apostle of Sussex, <a href="#note-151" name="noteref-151"><small>151</small></a> accepted from his
royal convert the gift of the Vpeninsula of Selsey, near Chichester,
with the persons and property of its inhabitants, who then amounted
to eighty-seven families. He released them at once from spiritual and
temporal bondage; and two hundred and fifty slaves of both sexes were
baptized by their indulgent master. The kingdom of Sussex, which spread
from the sea to the Thames, contained seven thousand families; twelve
hundred were ascribed to the Isle of Wight; and, if we multiply this
vague computation, it may seem probable, that England was cultivated by
a million of servants, or villains, who were attached to the estates of
their arbitrary landlords. The indigent Barbarians were often tempted
to sell their children, or themselves into perpetual, and even foreign,
bondage; <a href="#note-152" name="noteref-152"><small>152</small></a> yet the special exemptions which were granted to national
slaves, <a href="#note-153" name="noteref-153"><small>153</small></a> sufficiently declare that they were much less numerous
than the strangers and captives, who had lost their liberty, or changed
their masters, by the accidents of war. When time and religion had
mitigated the fierce spirit of the Anglo-Saxons, the laws encouraged
the frequent practice of manumission; and their subjects, of Welsh
or Cambrian extraction, assumed the respectable station of inferior
freemen, possessed of lands, and entitled to the rights of civil
society. <a href="#note-154" name="noteref-154"><small>154</small></a> Such gentle treatment might secure the allegiance of a
fierce people, who had been recently subdued on the confines of Wales
and Cornwall. The sage Ina, the legislator of Wessex, united the two
nations in the bands of domestic alliance; and four British lords of
Somersetshire may be honorably distinguished in the court of a Saxon

The independent Britons appear to have relapsed into the state of
original barbarism, from whence they had been imperfectly reclaimed.
Separated by their enemies from the rest of mankind, they soon became
an object of scandal and abhorrence to the Catholic world. <a href="#note-156" name="noteref-156"><small>156</small></a>
Christianity was still professed in the mountains of Wales; but the rude
schismatics, in the form of the clerical tonsure, and in the day of the
celebration of Easter, obstinately resisted the imperious mandates
of the Roman pontiffs. The use of the Latin language was insensibly
abolished, and the Britons were deprived of the art and learning which
Italy communicated to her Saxon proselytes. In Wales and Armorica,
the Celtic tongue, the native idiom of the West, was preserved and
propagated; and the Bards, who had been the companions of the Druids,
were still protected, in the sixteenth century, by the laws of
Elizabeth. Their chief, a respectable officer of the courts of Pengwern,
or Aberfraw, or Caermarthen, accompanied the king's servants to war: the
monarchy of the Britons, which he sung in the front of battle, excited
their courage, and justified their depredations; and the songster
claimed for his legitimate prize the fairest heifer of the spoil.
His subordinate ministers, the masters and disciples of vocal and
instrumental music, visited, in their respective circuits, the royal,
the noble, and the plebeian houses; and the public poverty, almost
exhausted by the clergy, was oppressed by the importunate demands of the
bards. Their rank and merit were ascertained by solemn trials, and the
strong belief of supernatural inspiration exalted the fancy of the poet,
and of his audience. <a href="#note-157" name="noteref-157"><small>157</small></a> The last retreats of Celtic freedom,
the extreme territories of Gaul and Britain, were less adapted to
agriculture than to pasturage: the wealth of the Britons consisted in
their flocks and herds; milk and flesh were their ordinary food; and
bread was sometimes esteemed, or rejected, as a foreign luxury. Liberty
had peopled the mountains of Wales and the morasses of Armorica; but
their populousness has been maliciously ascribed to the loose practice
of polygamy; and the houses of these licentious barbarians have been
supposed to contain ten wives, and perhaps fifty children. <a href="#note-158" name="noteref-158"><small>158</small></a> Their
disposition was rash and choleric; they were bold in action and in
speech; <a href="#note-159" name="noteref-159"><small>159</small></a> and as they were ignorant of the arts of peace, they
alternately indulged their passions in foreign and domestic war.
The cavalry of Armorica, the spearmen of Gwent, and the archers of
Merioneth, were equally formidable; but their poverty could seldom
procure either shields or helmets; and the inconvenient weight would
have retarded the speed and agility of their desultory operations. One
of the greatest of the English monarchs was requested to satisfy the
curiosity of a Greek emperor concerning the state of Britain; and Henry
II. could assert, from his personal experience, that Wales was inhabited
by a race of naked warriors, who encountered, without fear, the
defensive armor of their enemies. <a href="#note-160" name="noteref-160"><small>160</small></a>

By the revolution of Britain, the limits of science, as well as of
empire, were contracted. The dark cloud, which had been cleared by the
Phoenician discoveries, and finally dispelled by the arms of Caesar,
again settled on the shores of the Atlantic, and a Roman province was
again lost among the fabulous Islands of the Ocean. One hundred and
fifty years after the reign of Honorius, the gravest historian of the
times <a href="#note-161" name="noteref-161"><small>161</small></a> describes the wonders of a remote isle, whose eastern and
western parts are divided by an antique wall, the boundary of life
and death, or, more properly, of truth and fiction. The east is a fair
country, inhabited by a civilized people: the air is healthy, the waters
are pure and plentiful, and the earth yields her regular and fruitful
increase. In the west, beyond the wall, the air is infectious and
mortal; the ground is covered with serpents; and this dreary solitude
is the region of departed spirits, who are transported from the opposite
shores in substantial boats, and by living rowers. Some families of
fishermen, the subjects of the Franks, are excused from tribute, in
consideration of the mysterious office which is performed by these
Charons of the ocean. Each in his turn is summoned, at the hour of
midnight, to hear the voices, and even the names, of the ghosts: he is
sensible of their weight, and he feels himself impelled by an unknown,
but irresistible power. After this dream of fancy, we read with
astonishment, that the name of this island is Brittia; that it lies in
the ocean, against the mouth of the Rhine, and less than thirty miles
from the continent; that it is possessed by three nations, the Frisians,
the Angles, and the Britons; and that some Angles had appeared at
Constantinople, in the train of the French ambassadors. From these
ambassadors Procopius might be informed of a singular, though not
improbable, adventure, which announces the spirit, rather than the
delicacy, of an English heroine. She had been betrothed to Radiger, king
of the Varni, a tribe of Germans who touched the ocean and the Rhine;
but the perfidious lover was tempted, by motives of policy, to prefer
his father's widow, the sister of Theodebert, king of the Franks. <a href="#note-162" name="noteref-162"><small>162</small></a>
The forsaken princess of the Angles, instead of bewailing, revenged her
disgrace. Her warlike subjects are said to have been ignorant of the
use, and even of the form, of a horse; but she boldly sailed from
Britain to the mouth of the Rhine, with a fleet of four hundred ships,
and an army of one hundred thousand men. After the loss of a battle,
the captive Radiger implored the mercy of his victorious bride, who
generously pardoned his offence, dismissed her rival, and compelled the
king of the Varni to discharge with honor and fidelity the duties of
a husband. <a href="#note-163" name="noteref-163"><small>163</small></a> This gallant exploit appears to be the last naval
enterprise of the Anglo-Saxons. The arts of navigation, by which they
acquired the empire of Britain and of the sea, were soon neglected
by the indolent Barbarians, who supinely renounced all the commercial
advantages of their insular situation. Seven independent kingdoms
were agitated by perpetual discord; and the British world was seldom
connected, either in peace or war, with the nations of the Continent.

I have now accomplished the laborious narrative of the decline and fall
of the Roman empire, from the fortunate age of Trajan and the Antonines,
to its total extinction in the West, about five centuries after the
Christian era. At that unhappy period, the Saxons fiercely struggled
with the natives for the possession of Britain: Gaul and Spain were
divided between the powerful monarchies of the Franks and Visigoths, and
the dependent kingdoms of the Suevi and Burgundians: Africa was exposed
to the cruel persecution of the Vandals, and the savage insults of the
Moors: Rome and Italy, as far as the banks of the Danube, were afflicted
by an army of Barbarian mercenaries, whose lawless tyranny was succeeded
by the reign of Theodoric the Ostrogoth. All the subjects of the empire,
who, by the use of the Latin language, more particularly deserved
the name and privileges of Romans, were oppressed by the disgrace and
calamities of foreign conquest; and the victorious nations of Germany
established a new system of manners and government in the western
countries of Europe. The majesty of Rome was faintly represented by
the princes of Constantinople, the feeble and imaginary successors of
Augustus. Yet they continued to reign over the East, from the Danube to
the Nile and Tigris; the Gothic and Vandal kingdoms of Italy and Africa
were subverted by the arms of Justinian; and the history of the Greek
emperors may still afford a long series of instructive lessons, and
interesting revolutions.

    General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire
		In The West.
</pre>
<p>
The Greeks, after their country had been reduced into a province,
imputed the triumphs of Rome, not to the merit, but to the fortune, of
the republic. The inconstant goddess, who so blindly distributes and
resumes her favors, had now consented (such was the language of envious
flattery) to resign her wings, to descend from her globe, and to fix her
firm and immutable throne on the banks of the Tyber. <a href="#note-1000" name="noteref-1000"><small>1000</small></a> A wiser Greek,
who has composed, with a philosophic spirit, the memorable history
of his own times, deprived his countrymen of this vain and delusive
comfort, by opening to their view the deep foundations of the greatness
of Rome. <a href="#note-2000" name="noteref-2000"><small>2000</small></a> The fidelity of the citizens to each other, and to the
state, was confirmed by the habits of education, and the prejudices of
religion. Honor, as well as virtue, was the principle of the republic;
the ambitious citizens labored to deserve the solemn glories of a
triumph; and the ardor of the Roman youth was kindled into active
emulation, as often as they beheld the domestic images of their
ancestors. <a href="#note-3000" name="noteref-3000"><small>3000</small></a> The temperate struggles of the patricians and plebeians
had finally established the firm and equal balance of the constitution;
which united the freedom of popular assemblies, with the authority and
wisdom of a senate, and the executive powers of a regal magistrate. When
the consul displayed the standard of the republic, each citizen bound
himself, by the obligation of an oath, to draw his sword in the cause
of his country, till he had discharged the sacred duty by a military
service of ten years. This wise institution continually poured into the
field the rising generations of freemen and soldiers; and their numbers
were reenforced by the warlike and populous states of Italy, who, after
a brave resistance, had yielded to the valor and embraced the alliance,
of the Romans. The sage historian, who excited the virtue of the younger
Scipio, and beheld the ruin of Carthage, <a href="#note-4000" name="noteref-4000"><small>4000</small></a> has accurately described
their military system; their levies, arms, exercises, subordination,
marches, encampments; and the invincible legion, superior in active
strength to the Macedonian phalanx of Philip and Alexander. From these
institutions of peace and war Polybius has deduced the spirit and
success of a people, incapable of fear, and impatient of repose. The
ambitious design of conquest, which might have been defeated by the
seasonable conspiracy of mankind, was attempted and achieved; and the
perpetual violation of justice was maintained by the political virtues
of prudence and courage. The arms of the republic, sometimes vanquished
in battle, always victorious in war, advanced with rapid steps to the
Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and the Ocean; and the images of gold,
or silver, or brass, that might serve to represent the nations and their
kings, were successively broken by the iron monarchy of Rome. <a href="#note-5000" name="noteref-5000"><small>5000</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The rise of a city, which swelled into an empire, may deserve, as a
singular prodigy, the reflection of a philosophic mind. But the decline
of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness.
Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction
multiplied with the extent of conquest; and as soon as time or accident
had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to
the pressure of its own weight. The story of its ruin is simple and
obvious; and instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we
should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The victorious
legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and
mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards
violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their
personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient
of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to
their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigor of the military government
was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions
of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of
Barbarians.
</p>
<p>
The decay of Rome has been frequently ascribed to the translation of the
seat of empire; but this History has already shown, that the powers
of government were divided, rather than removed. The throne of
Constantinople was erected in the East; while the West was still
possessed by a series of emperors who held their residence in Italy,
and claimed their equal inheritance of the legions and provinces. This
dangerous novelty impaired the strength, and fomented the vices, of a
double reign: the instruments of an oppressive and arbitrary system were
multiplied; and a vain emulation of luxury, not of merit, was introduced
and supported between the degenerate successors of Theodosius. Extreme
distress, which unites the virtue of a free people, imbitters the
factions of a declining monarchy. The hostile favorites of Arcadius and
Honorius betrayed the republic to its common enemies; and the Byzantine
court beheld with indifference, perhaps with pleasure, the disgrace
of Rome, the misfortunes of Italy, and the loss of the West. Under the
succeeding reigns, the alliance of the two empires was restored; but the
aid of the Oriental Romans was tardy, doubtful, and ineffectual; and the
national schism of the Greeks and Latins was enlarged by the perpetual
difference of language and manners, of interests, and even of religion.
Yet the salutary event approved in some measure the judgment of
Constantine. During a long period of decay, his impregnable city
repelled the victorious armies of Barbarians, protected the wealth of
Asia, and commanded, both in peace and war, the important straits
which connect the Euxine and Mediterranean Seas. The foundation of
Constantinople more essentially contributed to the preservation of the
East, than to the ruin of the West.
</p>
<p>
As the happiness of a future life is the great object of religion, we
may hear without surprise or scandal, that the introduction or at least
the abuse, of Christianity had some influence on the decline and fall
of the Roman empire. The clergy successfully preached the doctrines
of patience and pusillanimity: the active virtues of society were
discouraged; and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the
cloister: a large portion of public and private wealth was consecrated
to the specious demands of charity and devotion; and the soldiers' pay
was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes, who could
only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity. <a href="#note-511" name="noteref-511"><small>511</small></a> Faith, zeal,
curiosity, and the more earthly passions of malice and ambition, kindled
the flame of theological discord; the church, and even the state, were
distracted by religious factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody,
and always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted from
camps to synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new species of
tyranny; and the persecuted sects became the secret enemies of their
country. Yet party spirit, however pernicious or absurd, is a principle
of union as well as of dissension. The bishops, from eighteen hundred
pulpits, inculcated the duty of passive obedience to a lawful
and orthodox sovereign; their frequent assemblies, and perpetual
correspondence, maintained the communion of distant churches; and the
benevolent temper of the gospel was strengthened, though confined, by
the spiritual alliance of the Catholics. The sacred indolence of the
monks was devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age; but if
superstition had not afforded a decent retreat, the same vices would
have tempted the unworthy Romans to desert, from baser motives, the
standard of the republic. Religious precepts are easily obeyed, which
indulge and sanctify the natural inclinations of their votaries; but
the pure and genuine influence of Christianity may be traced in its
beneficial, though imperfect, effects on the Barbarian proselytes of the
North. If the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion
of Constantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall,
and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors.

</p>
<p>
This awful revolution may be usefully applied to the instruction of
the present age. It is the duty of a patriot to prefer and promote the
exclusive interest and glory of his native country: but a philosmay
be permitted to enlarge his views, and to consider Europe as one great
republic whose various inhabitants have obtained almost the same level
of politeness and cultivation. The balance of power will continue to
fluctuate, and the prosperity of our own, or the neighboring kingdoms,
may be alternately exalted or depressed; but these partial events cannot
essentially injure our general state of happiness, the system of arts,
and laws, and manners, which so advantageously distinguish, above the
rest of mankind, the Europeans and their colonies. The savage nations
of the globe are the common enemies of civilized society; and we may
inquire, with anxious curiosity, whether Europe is still threatened with
a repetition of those calamities, which formerly oppressed the arms and
institutions of Rome. Perhaps the same reflections will illustrate
the fall of that mighty empire, and explain the probable causes of our
actual security.

<p>
I. The Romans were ignorant of the extent of their danger, and the
number of their enemies. Beyond the Rhine and Danube, the Northern
countries of Europe and Asia were filled with innumerable tribes of
hunters and shepherds, poor, voracious, and turbulent; bold in arms,
and impatient to ravish the fruits of industry. The Barbarian world was
agitated by the rapid impulse of war; and the peace of Gaul or Italy was
shaken by the distant revolutions of China. The Huns, who fled before a
victorious enemy, directed their march towards the West; and the torrent
was swelled by the gradual accession of captives and allies. The flying
tribes who yielded to the Huns assumed in their turn the spirit of
conquest; the endless column of Barbarians pressed on the Roman empire
with accumulated weight; and, if the foremost were destroyed, the vacant
space was instantly replenished by new assailants. Such formidable
emigrations can no longer issue from the North; and the long repose,
which has been imputed to the decrease of population, is the happy
consequence of the progress of arts and agriculture. Instead of some
rude villages, thinly scattered among its woods and morasses, Germany
now produces a list of two thousand three hundred walled towns:
the Christian kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Poland, have been
successively established; and the Hanse merchants, with the Teutonic
knights, have extended their colonies along the coast of the Baltic,
as far as the Gulf of Finland. From the Gulf of Finland to the Eastern
Ocean, Russia now assumes the form of a powerful and civilized empire.
The plough, the loom, and the forge, are introduced on the banks of the
Volga, the Oby, and the Lena; and the fiercest of the Tartar hordes have
been taught to tremble and obey. The reign of independent Barbarism is
now contracted to a narrow span; and the remnant of Calmucks or Uzbecks,
whose forces may be almost numbered, cannot seriously excite the
apprehensions of the great republic of Europe. <a href="#note-6000" name="noteref-6000"><small>6000</small></a> Yet this apparent
security should not tempt us to forget, that new enemies, and unknown
dangers, may possibly arise from some obscure people, scarcely visible
in the map of the world, The Arabs or Saracens, who spread their
conquests from India to Spain, had languished in poverty and contempt,
till Mahomet breathed into those savage bodies the soul of enthusiasm.

[ The French and English editors of the Genealogical History

Calmucks, or Eluths, since they have been recently vanquished by
the Chinese, who, in the year 1759, subdued the Lesser Bucharia, and
advanced into the country of Badakshan, near the source of the Oxus,

are precarious, nor will I venture to insure the safety of the Chinese

II. The empire of Rome was firmly established by the singular and
perfect coalition of its members. The subject nations, resigning the
hope, and even the wish, of independence, embraced the character of
Roman citizens; and the provinces of the West were reluctantly torn
by the Barbarians from the bosom of their mother country. <a href="#note-7000" name="noteref-7000"><small>7000</small></a> But this
union was purchased by the loss of national freedom and military spirit;
and the servile provinces, destitute of life and motion, expected their
safety from the mercenary troops and governors, who were directed by the
orders of a distant court. The happiness of a hundred millions depended
on the personal merit of one or two men, perhaps children, whose minds
were corrupted by education, luxury, and despotic power. The deepest
wounds were inflicted on the empire during the minorities of the sons
and grandsons of Theodosius; and, after those incapable princes seemed
to attain the age of manhood, they abandoned the church to the bishops,
the state to the eunuchs, and the provinces to the Barbarians. Europe
is now divided into twelve powerful, though unequal kingdoms, three
respectable commonwealths, and a variety of smaller, though independent,
states: the chances of royal and ministerial talents are multiplied, at
least, with the number of its rulers; and a Julian, or Semiramis, may
reign in the North, while Arcadius and Honorius again slumber on the
thrones of the South. The abuses of tyranny are restrained by the
mutual influence of fear and shame; republics have acquired order and
stability; monarchies have imbibed the principles of freedom, or, at
least, of moderation; and some sense of honor and justice is introduced
into the most defective constitutions by the general manners of the
times. In peace, the progress of knowledge and industry is accelerated
by the emulation of so many active rivals: in war, the European
forces are exercised by temperate and undecisive contests. If a savage
conqueror should issue from the deserts of Tartary, he must repeatedly
vanquish the robust peasants of Russia, the numerous armies of Germany,
the gallant nobles of France, and the intrepid freemen of Britain;
who, perhaps, might confederate for their common defence. Should
the victorious Barbarians carry slavery and desolation as far as the
Atlantic Ocean, ten thousand vessels would transport beyond their
pursuit the remains of civilized society; and Europe would revive
and flourish in the American world, which is already filled with her
colonies and institutions. <a href="#note-8000" name="noteref-8000"><small>8000</small></a>

[ The prudent reader will determine how far this general
proposition is weakened by the revolt of the Isaurians, the independence
of Britain and Armorica, the Moorish tribes, or the Bagaudae of Gaul and
Spain, (vol. i. p. 328, vol. iii. p. 315, vol. iii. p. 372, 480.)]

[ America now contains about six millions of European blood
and descent; and their numbers, at least in the North, are continually
increasing. Whatever may be the changes of their political situation,
they must preserve the manners of Europe; and we may reflect with some
pleasure, that the English language will probably be diffused ever an
immense and populous continent.]

III. Cold, poverty, and a life of danger and fatigue, fortify the
strength and courage of Barbarians. In every age they have oppressed the
polite and peaceful nations of China, India, and Persia, who neglected,
and still neglect, to counterbalance these natural powers by the
resources of military art. The warlike states of antiquity, Greece,
Macedonia, and Rome, educated a race of soldiers; exercised their
bodies, disciplined their courage, multiplied their forces by regular
evolutions, and converted the iron, which they possessed, into strong
and serviceable weapons. But this superiority insensibly declined with
their laws and manners; and the feeble policy of Constantine and his
successors armed and instructed, for the ruin of the empire, the rude
valor of the Barbarian mercenaries. The military art has been changed
by the invention of gunpowder; which enables man to command the two
most powerful agents of nature, air and fire. Mathematics, chemistry,
mechanics, architecture, have been applied to the service of war; and
the adverse parties oppose to each other the most elaborate modes of
attack and of defence. Historians may indignantly observe, that the
preparations of a siege would found and maintain a flourishing colony;
<a href="#note-9000" name="noteref-9000"><small>9000</small></a> yet we cannot be displeased, that the subversion of a city should be
a work of cost and difficulty; or that an industrious people should be
protected by those arts, which survive and supply the decay of military
virtue. Cannon and fortifications now form an impregnable barrier
against the Tartar horse; and Europe is secure from any future
irruptions of Barbarians; since, before they can conquer, they must
cease to be barbarous. Their gradual advances in the science of war
would always be accompanied, as we may learn from the example of Russia,
with a proportionable improvement in the arts of peace and civil policy;
and they themselves must deserve a place among the polished nations whom
they subdue.

Should these speculations be found doubtful or fallacious, there still
remains a more humble source of comfort and hope. The discoveries of
ancient and modern navigators, and the domestic history, or tradition,
of the most enlightened nations, represent the human savage, naked both
in body and mind and destitute of laws, of arts, of ideas, and almost
of language. <a href="#note-1001" name="noteref-1001"><small>1001</small></a> From this abject condition, perhaps the primitive and
universal state of man, he has gradually arisen to command the animals,
to fertilize the earth, to traverse the ocean and to measure the
heavens. His progress in the improvement and exercise of his mental and
corporeal faculties <a href="#note-1101" name="noteref-1101"><small>1101</small></a> has been irregular and various; infinitely slow
in the beginning, and increasing by degrees with redoubled velocity:
ages of laborious ascent have been followed by a moment of rapid
downfall; and the several climates of the globe have felt the
vicissitudes of light and darkness. Yet the experience of four thousand
years should enlarge our hopes, and diminish our apprehensions: we
cannot determine to what height the human species may aspire in their
advances towards perfection; but it may safely be presumed, that no
people, unless the face of nature is changed, will relapse into their
original barbarism. The improvements of society may be viewed under a
threefold aspect. 1. The poet or philosopher illustrates his age and
country by the efforts of a single mind; but those superior powers of
reason or fancy are rare and spontaneous productions; and the genius of
Homer, or Cicero, or Newton, would excite less admiration, if they could
be created by the will of a prince, or the lessons of a preceptor. 2.
The benefits of law and policy, of trade and manufactures, of arts and
sciences, are more solid and permanent: and many individuals may be
qualified, by education and discipline, to promote, in their respective
stations, the interest of the community. But this general order is the
effect of skill and labor; and the complex machinery may be decayed by
time, or injured by violence.
</p>
<p>
3. Fortunately for mankind, the more useful, or, at least, more
necessary arts, can be performed without superior talents, or national
subordination: without the powers of one, or the union of many. Each
village, each family, each individual, must always possess both ability
and inclination to perpetuate the use of fire <a href="#note-1201" name="noteref-1201"><small>1201</small></a> and of metals; the
propagation and service of domestic animals; the methods of hunting and
fishing; the rudiments of navigation; the imperfect cultivation of
corn, or other nutritive grain; and the simple practice of the mechanic
trades. Private genius and public industry may be extirpated; but these
hardy plants survive the tempest, and strike an everlasting root into
the most unfavorable soil. The splendid days of Augustus and Trajan were
eclipsed by a cloud of ignorance; and the Barbarians subverted the laws
and palaces of Rome. But the scythe, the invention or emblem of Saturn,
<a href="#note-1302" name="noteref-1302"><small>1302</small></a> still continued annually to mow the harvests of Italy; and the
human feasts of the Laestrigons <a href="#note-1401" name="noteref-1401"><small>1401</small></a> have never been renewed on the
coast of Campania.

[ It would be an easy, though tedious, task, to produce the
authorities of poets, philosophers, and historians. I shall therefore
content myself with appealing to the decisive and authentic testimony of
Diodorus Siculus, (tom. i. l. i. p. 11, 12, l. iii. p. 184, &amp;c., edit.
Wesseling.) The Icthyophagi, who in his time wandered along the shores
of the Red Sea, can only be compared to the natives of New Holland,
(Dampier's Voyages, vol. i. p. 464-469.) Fancy, or perhaps reason, may
still suppose an extreme and absolute state of nature far below the
level of these savages, who had acquired some arts and instruments.]

Since the first discovery of the arts, war, commerce, and religious
zeal have diffused, among the savages of the Old and New World, these
inestimable gifts: they have been successively propagated; they can
never be lost. We may therefore acquiesce in the pleasing conclusion,
that every age of the world has increased, and still increases, the real
wealth, the happiness, the knowledge, and perhaps the virtue, of the
human race. <a href="#note-1501" name="noteref-1501"><small>1501</small></a>

[ The merit of discovery has too often been stained with
avarice, cruelty, and fanaticism; and the intercourse of nations
has produced the communication of disease and prejudice. A singular
exception is due to the virtue of our own times and country. The five
great voyages, successively undertaken by the command of his present
Majesty, were inspired by the pure and generous love of science and of
mankind. The same prince, adapting his benefactions to the different
stages of society, has founded his school of painting in his capital;
and has introduced into the islands of the South Sea the vegetables and
animals most useful to human life.]
