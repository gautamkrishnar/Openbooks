<p>
While the Romans languished under the ignominious tyranny of eunuchs
and bishops, the praises of Julian were repeated with transport in every
part of the empire, except in the palace of Constantius. The barbarians
of Germany had felt, and still dreaded, the arms of the young
Caesar; his soldiers were the companions of his victory; the grateful
provincials enjoyed the blessings of his reign; but the favorites, who
had opposed his elevation, were offended by his virtues; and they justly
considered the friend of the people as the enemy of the court. As long
as the fame of Julian was doubtful, the buffoons of the palace, who
were skilled in the language of satire, tried the efficacy of those arts
which they had so often practised with success. They easily discovered,
that his simplicity was not exempt from affectation: the ridiculous
epithets of a hairy savage, of an ape invested with the purple, were
applied to the dress and person of the philosophic warrior; and his
modest despatches were stigmatized as the vain and elaborate fictions
of a loquacious Greek, a speculative soldier, who had studied the art of
war amidst the groves of the academy. <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> The voice of malicious folly
was at length silenced by the shouts of victory; the conqueror of the
Franks and Alemanni could no longer be painted as an object of contempt;
and the monarch himself was meanly ambitious of stealing from his
lieutenant the honorable reward of his labors. In the letters crowned
with laurel, which, according to ancient custom, were addressed to the
provinces, the name of Julian was omitted. "Constantius had made his
dispositions in person; he had signalized his valor in the foremost
ranks; his military conduct had secured the victory; and the captive
king of the barbarians was presented to him on the field of battle,"
from which he was at that time distant about forty days' journey. <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a>
So extravagant a fable was incapable, however, of deceiving the public
credulity, or even of satisfying the pride of the emperor himself.
Secretly conscious that the applause and favor of the Romans accompanied
the rising fortunes of Julian, his discontented mind was prepared to
receive the subtle poison of those artful sycophants, who colored their
mischievous designs with the fairest appearances of truth and candor.
<a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> Instead of depreciating the merits of Julian, they acknowledged,
and even exaggerated, his popular fame, superior talents, and important
services. But they darkly insinuated, that the virtues of the Caesar
might instantly be converted into the most dangerous crimes, if the
inconstant multitude should prefer their inclinations to their duty;
or if the general of a victorious army should be tempted from his
allegiance by the hopes of revenge and independent greatness. The
personal fears of Constantius were interpreted by his council as a
laudable anxiety for the public safety; whilst in private, and perhaps
in his own breast, he disguised, under the less odious appellation of
fear, the sentiments of hatred and envy, which he had secretly conceived
for the inimitable virtues of Julian.

Eunapius in a newly-discovered fragment) was wont to call his antagonist
Sylla a beast half lion and half fox. Constantius had nothing of the
lion, but was surrounded by a whole litter of foxes. Mai. Script. Byz.

believed whatever was contained in the Imperial letters, which were
addressed to the senate of Constantinople Aurelius Victor, who published
his Abridgment in the last year of Constantius, ascribes the German
victories to the wisdom of the emperor, and the fortune of the Caesar.
Yet the historian, soon afterwards, was indebted to the favor or esteem
of Julian for the honor of a brass statue, and the important offices of
consular of the second Pannonia, and praefect of the city, Ammian. xxi.

</p>
<p>
The apparent tranquillity of Gaul, and the imminent danger of the
eastern provinces, offered a specious pretence for the design which was
artfully concerted by the Imperial ministers. They resolved to disarm
the Caesar; to recall those faithful troops who guarded his person and
dignity; and to employ, in a distant war against the Persian monarch,
the hardy veterans who had vanquished, on the banks of the Rhine, the
fiercest nations of Germany. While Julian used the laborious hours of
his winter quarters at Paris in the administration of power, which, in
his hands, was the exercise of virtue, he was surprised by the hasty
arrival of a tribune and a notary, with positive orders, from the
emperor, which they were directed to execute, and he was commanded not
to oppose. Constantius signified his pleasure, that four entire legions,
the Celtae, and Petulants, the Heruli, and the Batavians, should be
separated from the standard of Julian, under which they had acquired
their fame and discipline; that in each of the remaining bands three
hundred of the bravest youths should be selected; and that this numerous
detachment, the strength of the Gallic army, should instantly begin
their march, and exert their utmost diligence to arrive, before the
opening of the campaign, on the frontiers of Persia. <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> The Caesar
foresaw and lamented the consequences of this fatal mandate. Most of the
auxiliaries, who engaged their voluntary service, had stipulated, that
they should never be obliged to pass the Alps. The public faith of Rome,
and the personal honor of Julian, had been pledged for the observance
of this condition. Such an act of treachery and oppression would destroy
the confidence, and excite the resentment, of the independent warriors
of Germany, who considered truth as the noblest of their virtues, and
freedom as the most valuable of their possessions. The legionaries,
who enjoyed the title and privileges of Romans, were enlisted for the
general defence of the republic; but those mercenary troops heard with
cold indifference the antiquated names of the republic and of Rome.
Attached, either from birth or long habit, to the climate and manners of
Gaul, they loved and admired Julian; they despised, and perhaps hated,
the emperor; they dreaded the laborious march, the Persian arrows, and
the burning deserts of Asia. They claimed as their own the country which
they had saved; and excused their want of spirit, by pleading the sacred
and more immediate duty of protecting their families and friends.
</p>
<p>
The apprehensions of the Gauls were derived from the knowledge of the
impending and inevitable danger. As soon as the provinces were exhausted
of their military strength, the Germans would violate a treaty which had
been imposed on their fears; and notwithstanding the abilities and valor
of Julian, the general of a nominal army, to whom the public calamities
would be imputed, must find himself, after a vain resistance, either a
prisoner in the camp of the barbarians, or a criminal in the palace of
Constantius. If Julian complied with the orders which he had received,
he subscribed his own destruction, and that of a people who deserved
his affection. But a positive refusal was an act of rebellion, and
a declaration of war. The inexorable jealousy of the emperor, the
peremptory, and perhaps insidious, nature of his commands, left not any
room for a fair apology, or candid interpretation; and the dependent
station of the Caesar scarcely allowed him to pause or to deliberate.
Solitude increased the perplexity of Julian; he could no longer apply to
the faithful counsels of Sallust, who had been removed from his office
by the judicious malice of the eunuchs: he could not even enforce his
representations by the concurrence of the ministers, who would have
been afraid or ashamed to approve the ruin of Gaul. The moment had been
chosen, when Lupicinus, <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> the general of the cavalry, was despatched
into Britain, to repulse the inroads of the Scots and Picts; and
Florentius was occupied at Vienna by the assessment of the tribute.
The latter, a crafty and corrupt statesman, declining to assume a
responsible part on this dangerous occasion, eluded the pressing and
repeated invitations of Julian, who represented to him, that in every
important measure, the presence of the praefect was indispensable in the
council of the prince. In the mean while the Caesar was oppressed by
the rude and importunate solicitations of the Imperial messengers, who
presumed to suggest, that if he expected the return of his ministers, he
would charge himself with the guilt of the delay, and reserve for them
the merit of the execution. Unable to resist, unwilling to comply,
Julian expressed, in the most serious terms, his wish, and even his
intention, of resigning the purple, which he could not preserve with
honor, but which he could not abdicate with safety.

[ The minute interval, which may be interposed, between the
hyeme adulta and the primo vere of Ammianus, (xx. l. 4,) instead of
allowing a sufficient space for a march of three thousand miles, would
render the orders of Constantius as extravagant as they were unjust. The
troops of Gaul could not have reached Syria till the end of autumn.
The memory of Ammianus must have been inaccurate, and his language
incorrect. * Note: The late editor of Ammianus attempts to vindicate
his author from the charge of inaccuracy. "It is clear, from the whole
course of the narrative, that Constantius entertained this design of
demanding his troops from Julian, immediately after the taking of Amida,
in the autumn of the preceding year, and had transmitted his orders into
Gaul, before it was known that Lupicinus had gone into Britain with the
Herulians and Batavians." Wagner, note to Amm. xx. 4. But it seems
also clear that the troops were in winter quarters (hiemabant) when the
orders arrived. Ammianus can scarcely be acquitted of incorrectness in
his language at least.&mdash;M]

[ Ammianus, xx. l. The valor of Lupicinus, and his military
skill, are acknowledged by the historian, who, in his affected language,
accuses the general of exalting the horns of his pride, bellowing in
a tragic tone, and exciting a doubt whether he was more cruel or
avaricious. The danger from the Scots and Picts was so serious that
Julian himself had some thoughts of passing over into the island.]
</p>
<p>
After a painful conflict, Julian was compelled to acknowledge, that
obedience was the virtue of the most eminent subject, and that the
sovereign alone was entitled to judge of the public welfare. He issued
the necessary orders for carrying into execution the commands of
Constantius; a part of the troops began their march for the Alps;
and the detachments from the several garrisons moved towards their
respective places of assembly. They advanced with difficulty through the
trembling and affrighted crowds of provincials, who attempted to excite
their pity by silent despair, or loud lamentations, while the wives of
the soldiers, holding their infants in their arms, accused the desertion
of their husbands, in the mixed language of grief, of tenderness, and
of indignation. This scene of general distress afflicted the humanity of
the Caesar; he granted a sufficient number of post-wagons to transport
the wives and families of the soldiers, <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> endeavored to alleviate the
hardships which he was constrained to inflict, and increased, by the
most laudable arts, his own popularity, and the discontent of the exiled
troops. The grief of an armed multitude is soon converted into rage;
their licentious murmurs, which every hour were communicated from tent
to tent with more boldness and effect, prepared their minds for the
most daring acts of sedition; and by the connivance of their tribunes, a
seasonable libel was secretly dispersed, which painted in lively colors
the disgrace of the Caesar, the oppression of the Gallic army, and the
feeble vices of the tyrant of Asia. The servants of Constantius were
astonished and alarmed by the progress of this dangerous spirit. They
pressed the Caesar to hasten the departure of the troops; but they
imprudently rejected the honest and judicious advice of Julian; who
proposed that they should not march through Paris, and suggested the
danger and temptation of a last interview.

[ He granted them the permission of the cursus clavularis, or
clabularis. These post-wagons are often mentioned in the Code, and were
supposed to carry fifteen hundred pounds weight. See Vales. ad Ammian.
xx. 4.]
</p>
<p>
As soon as the approach of the troops was announced, the Caesar went
out to meet them, and ascended his tribunal, which had been erected in
a plain before the gates of the city. After distinguishing the officers
and soldiers, who by their rank or merit deserved a peculiar attention,
Julian addressed himself in a studied oration to the surrounding
multitude: he celebrated their exploits with grateful applause;
encouraged them to accept, with alacrity, the honor of serving under
the eye of a powerful and liberal monarch; and admonished them, that
the commands of Augustus required an instant and cheerful obedience.
The soldiers, who were apprehensive of offending their general by an
indecent clamor, or of belying their sentiments by false and venal
acclamations, maintained an obstinate silence; and after a short
pause, were dismissed to their quarters. The principal officers were
entertained by the Caesar, who professed, in the warmest language of
friendship, his desire and his inability to reward, according to their
deserts, the brave companions of his victories. They retired from the
feast, full of grief and perplexity; and lamented the hardship of
their fate, which tore them from their beloved general and their native
country. The only expedient which could prevent their separation was
boldly agitated and approved the popular resentment was insensibly
moulded into a regular conspiracy; their just reasons of complaint were
heightened by passion, and their passions were inflamed by wine; as,
on the eve of their departure, the troops were indulged in licentious
festivity. At the hour of midnight, the impetuous multitude, with
swords, and bows, and torches in their hands, rushed into the suburbs;
encompassed the palace; <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> and, careless of future dangers, pronounced
the fatal and irrevocable words, Julian Augustus! The prince, whose
anxious suspense was interrupted by their disorderly acclamations,
secured the doors against their intrusion; and as long as it was in his
power, secluded his person and dignity from the accidents of a nocturnal
tumult. At the dawn of day, the soldiers, whose zeal was irritated
by opposition, forcibly entered the palace, seized, with respectful
violence, the object of their choice, guarded Julian with drawn swords
through the streets of Paris, placed him on the tribunal, and with
repeated shouts saluted him as their emperor. Prudence, as well as
loyalty, inculcated the propriety of resisting their treasonable
designs; and of preparing, for his oppressed virtue, the excuse
of violence. Addressing himself by turns to the multitude and to
individuals, he sometimes implored their mercy, and sometimes expressed
his indignation; conjured them not to sully the fame of their immortal
victories; and ventured to promise, that if they would immediately
return to their allegiance, he would undertake to obtain from the
emperor not only a free and gracious pardon, but even the revocation
of the orders which had excited their resentment. But the soldiers, who
were conscious of their guilt, chose rather to depend on the gratitude
of Julian, than on the clemency of the emperor. Their zeal was
insensibly turned into impatience, and their impatience into rage.
The inflexible Caesar sustained, till the third hour of the day, their
prayers, their reproaches, and their menaces; nor did he yield, till he
had been repeatedly assured, that if he wished to live, he must consent
to reign. He was exalted on a shield in the presence, and amidst the
unanimous acclamations, of the troops; a rich military collar, which was
offered by chance, supplied the want of a diadem; <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> the ceremony was
concluded by the promise of a moderate donative; and the new emperor,
overwhelmed with real or affected grief retired into the most secret
recesses of his apartment. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a>

Normans, this ancient palace was reduced, in the twelfth century, to a
maze of ruins, whose dark recesses were the scene of licentious love.</p>

[ For the whole narrative of this revolt, we may appeal
to authentic and original materials; Julian himself, (ad S. P. Q.
Atheniensem, p. 282, 283, 284,) Libanius, (Orat. Parental. c. 44-48, in
Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. vii. p. 269-273,) Ammianus, (xx. 4,)
and Zosimus, (l. iii. p. 151, 152, 153.) who, in the reign of Julian,
appears to follow the more respectable authority of Eunapius. With such
guides we might neglect the abbreviators and ecclesiastical historians.]
</p>
<p>
The grief of Julian could proceed only from his innocence; out his
innocence must appear extremely doubtful <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> in the eyes of those who
have learned to suspect the motives and the professions of princes. His
lively and active mind was susceptible of the various impressions of
hope and fear, of gratitude and revenge, of duty and of ambition, of the
love of fame, and of the fear of reproach. But it is impossible for us
to calculate the respective weight and operation of these sentiments;
or to ascertain the principles of action which might escape the
observation, while they guided, or rather impelled, the steps of Julian
himself. The discontent of the troops was produced by the malice of his
enemies; their tumult was the natural effect of interest and of passion;
and if Julian had tried to conceal a deep design under the appearances
of chance, he must have employed the most consummate artifice without
necessity, and probably without success. He solemnly declares, in the
presence of Jupiter, of the Sun, of Mars, of Minerva, and of all the
other deities, that till the close of the evening which preceded his
elevation, he was utterly ignorant of the designs of the soldiers; <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a>
and it may seem ungenerous to distrust the honor of a hero and the truth
of a philosopher. Yet the superstitious confidence that Constantius
was the enemy, and that he himself was the favorite, of the gods, might
prompt him to desire, to solicit, and even to hasten the auspicious
moment of his reign, which was predestined to restore the ancient
religion of mankind. When Julian had received the intelligence of the
conspiracy, he resigned himself to a short slumber; and afterwards
related to his friends that he had seen the genius of the empire
waiting with some impatience at his door, pressing for admittance,
and reproaching his want of spirit and ambition. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> Astonished
and perplexed, he addressed his prayers to the great Jupiter, who
immediately signified, by a clear and manifest omen, that he should
submit to the will of heaven and of the army. The conduct which
disclaims the ordinary maxims of reason, excites our suspicion and
eludes our inquiry. Whenever the spirit of fanaticism, at once so
credulous and so crafty, has insinuated itself into a noble mind, it
insensibly corrodes the vital principles of virtue and veracity.

dream, to which, before the event, he gave credit; of a stately tree
thrown to the ground, of a small plant striking a deep root into the
earth. Even in his sleep, the mind of the Caesar must have been agitated
by the hopes and fears of his fortune. Zosimus (l. iii. p. 155) relates

<p>
To moderate the zeal of his party, to protect the persons of his
enemies, <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> to defeat and to despise the secret enterprises which were
formed against his life and dignity, were the cares which employed
the first days of the reign of the new emperor. Although he was firmly
resolved to maintain the station which he had assumed, he was still
desirous of saving his country from the calamities of civil war, of
declining a contest with the superior forces of Constantius, and
of preserving his own character from the reproach of perfidy and
ingratitude. Adorned with the ensigns of military and imperial pomp,
Julian showed himself in the field of Mars to the soldiers, who glowed
with ardent enthusiasm in the cause of their pupil, their leader,
and their friend. He recapitulated their victories, lamented their
sufferings, applauded their resolution, animated their hopes, and
checked their impetuosity; nor did he dismiss the assembly, till he had
obtained a solemn promise from the troops, that if the emperor of the
East would subscribe an equitable treaty, they would renounce any views
of conquest, and satisfy themselves with the tranquil possession of the
Gallic provinces. On this foundation he composed, in his own name, and
in that of the army, a specious and moderate epistle, <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> which
was delivered to Pentadius, his master of the offices, and to his
chamberlain Eutherius; two ambassadors whom he appointed to receive the
answer, and observe the dispositions of Constantius. This epistle is
inscribed with the modest appellation of Caesar; but Julian solicits in
a peremptory, though respectful, manner, the confirmation of the title
of Augustus. He acknowledges the irregularity of his own election, while
he justifies, in some measure, the resentment and violence of the troops
which had extorted his reluctant consent. He allows the supremacy of
his brother Constantius; and engages to send him an annual present of
Spanish horses, to recruit his army with a select number of barbarian
youths, and to accept from his choice a Praetorian praefect of approved
discretion and fidelity. But he reserves for himself the nomination of
his other civil and military officers, with the troops, the revenue,
and the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps. He admonishes
the emperor to consult the dictates of justice; to distrust the arts of
those venal flatterers, who subsist only by the discord of princes;
and to embrace the offer of a fair and honorable treaty, equally
advantageous to the republic and to the house of Constantine. In this
negotiation Julian claimed no more than he already possessed. The
delegated authority which he had long exercised over the provinces of
Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was still obeyed under a name more independent
and august. The soldiers and the people rejoiced in a revolution which
was not stained even with the blood of the guilty. Florentius was a
fugitive; Lupicinus a prisoner. The persons who were disaffected to the
new government were disarmed and secured; and the vacant offices were
distributed, according to the recommendation of merit, by a prince who
despised the intrigues of the palace, and the clamors of the soldiers.

</p>
<p>
The negotiations of peace were accompanied and supported by the most
vigorous preparations for war. The army, which Julian held in readiness
for immediate action, was recruited and augmented by the disorders
of the times. The cruel persecutions of the faction of Magnentius had
filled Gaul with numerous bands of outlaws and robbers. They cheerfully
accepted the offer of a general pardon from a prince whom they could
trust, submitted to the restraints of military discipline, and
retained only their implacable hatred to the person and government of
Constantius. <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> As soon as the season of the year permitted Julian to
take the field, he appeared at the head of his legions; threw a bridge
over the Rhine in the neighborhood of Cleves; and prepared to chastise
the perfidy of the Attuarii, a tribe of Franks, who presumed that they
might ravage, with impunity, the frontiers of a divided empire. The
difficulty, as well as glory, of this enterprise, consisted in a
laborious march; and Julian had conquered, as soon as he could penetrate
into a country, which former princes had considered as inaccessible.
After he had given peace to the Barbarians, the emperor carefully
visited the fortifications along the Qhine from Cleves to Basil;
surveyed, with peculiar attention, the territories which he had
recovered from the hands of the Alemanni, passed through Besancon, <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a>
which had severely suffered from their fury, and fixed his headquarters
at Vienna for the ensuing winter. The barrier of Gaul was improved and
strengthened with additional fortifications; and Julian entertained some
hopes that the Germans, whom he had so often vanquished, might, in his
absence, be restrained by the terror of his name. Vadomair <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> was the
only prince of the Alemanni whom he esteemed or feared and while the
subtle Barbarian affected to observe the faith of treaties, the progress
of his arms threatened the state with an unseasonable and dangerous war.
The policy of Julian condescended to surprise the prince of the Alemanni
by his own arts: and Vadomair, who, in the character of a friend, had
incautiously accepted an invitation from the Roman governors, was seized
in the midst of the entertainment, and sent away prisoner into the heart
of Spain. Before the Barbarians were recovered from their amazement,
the emperor appeared in arms on the banks of the Rhine, and, once more
crossing the river, renewed the deep impressions of terror and respect
which had been already made by four preceding expeditions. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXII: Julian Declared Emperor.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
The ambassadors of Julian had been instructed to execute, with the
utmost diligence, their important commission. But, in their passage
through Italy and Illyricum, they were detained by the tedious and
affected delays of the provincial governors; they were conducted by
slow journeys from Constantinople to Caesarea in Cappadocia; and when
at length they were admitted to the presence of Constantius, they found
that he had already conceived, from the despatches of his own officers,
the most unfavorable opinion of the conduct of Julian, and of the Gallic
army. The letters were heard with impatience; the trembling messengers
were dismissed with indignation and contempt; and the looks, gestures,
the furious language of the monarch, expressed the disorder of his soul.
The domestic connection, which might have reconciled the brother and the
husband of Helena, was recently dissolved by the death of that princess,
whose pregnancy had been several times fruitless, and was at last fatal
to herself. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> The empress Eusebia had preserved, to the last moment
of her life, the warm, and even jealous, affection which she had
conceived for Julian; and her mild influence might have moderated the
resentment of a prince, who, since her death, was abandoned to his own
passions, and to the arts of his eunuchs. But the terror of a foreign
invasion obliged him to suspend the punishment of a private enemy:
he continued his march towards the confines of Persia, and thought it
sufficient to signify the conditions which might entitle Julian and
his guilty followers to the clemency of their offended sovereign. He
required, that the presumptuous Caesar should expressly renounce the
appellation and rank of Augustus, which he had accepted from the rebels;
that he should descend to his former station of a limited and dependent
minister; that he should vest the powers of the state and army in the
hands of those officers who were appointed by the Imperial court; and
that he should trust his safety to the assurances of pardon, which were
announced by Epictetus, a Gallic bishop, and one of the Arian favorites
of Constantius. Several months were ineffectually consumed in a treaty
which was negotiated at the distance of three thousand miles between
Paris and Antioch; and, as soon as Julian perceived that his modest and
respectful behavior served only to irritate the pride of an implacable
adversary, he boldly resolved to commit his life and fortune to the
chance of a civil war. He gave a public and military audience to the
quaestor Leonas: the haughty epistle of Constantius was read to the
attentive multitude; and Julian protested, with the most flattering
deference, that he was ready to resign the title of Augustus, if he
could obtain the consent of those whom he acknowledged as the authors
of his elevation. The faint proposal was impetuously silenced; and the
acclamations of "Julian Augustus, continue to reign, by the authority
of the army, of the people, of the republic which you have saved,"
thundered at once from every part of the field, and terrified the pale
ambassador of Constantius. A part of the letter was afterwards read,
in which the emperor arraigned the ingratitude of Julian, whom he had
invested with the honors of the purple; whom he had educated with so
much care and tenderness; whom he had preserved in his infancy, when he
was left a helpless orphan.
</p>
<p>
"An orphan!" interrupted Julian, who justified his cause by indulging
his passions: "does the assassin of my family reproach me that I was
left an orphan? He urges me to revenge those injuries which I have long
studied to forget." The assembly was dismissed; and Leonas, who, with
some difficulty, had been protected from the popular fury, was sent back
to his master with an epistle, in which Julian expressed, in a strain of
the most vehement eloquence, the sentiments of contempt, of hatred,
and of resentment, which had been suppressed and imbittered by the
dissimulation of twenty years. After this message, which might be
considered as a signal of irreconcilable war, Julian, who, some weeks
before, had celebrated the Christian festival of the Epiphany, <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> made
a public declaration that he committed the care of his safety to the
Immortal Gods; and thus publicly renounced the religion as well as the
friendship of Constantius. <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The situation of Julian required a vigorous and immediate resolution.
He had discovered, from intercepted letters, that his adversary,
sacrificing the interest of the state to that of the monarch, had again
excited the Barbarians to invade the provinces of the West. The position
of two magazines, one of them collected on the banks of the Lake of
Constance, the other formed at the foot of the Cottian Alps, seemed to
indicate the march of two armies; and the size of those magazines, each
of which consisted of six hundred thousand quarters of wheat, or rather
flour, <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> was a threatening evidence of the strength and numbers of
the enemy who prepared to surround him. But the Imperial legions were
still in their distant quarters of Asia; the Danube was feebly guarded;
and if Julian could occupy, by a sudden incursion, the important
provinces of Illyricum, he might expect that a people of soldiers would
resort to his standard, and that the rich mines of gold and silver
would contribute to the expenses of the civil war. He proposed this bold
enterprise to the assembly of the soldiers; inspired them with a just
confidence in their general, and in themselves; and exhorted them to
maintain their reputation of being terrible to the enemy, moderate to
their fellow-citizens, and obedient to their officers. His spirited
discourse was received with the loudest acclamations, and the same
troops which had taken up arms against Constantius, when he summoned
them to leave Gaul, now declared with alacrity, that they would follow
Julian to the farthest extremities of Europe or Asia. The oath of
fidelity was administered; and the soldiers, clashing their shields, and
pointing their drawn swords to their throats, devoted themselves, with
horrid imprecations, to the service of a leader whom they celebrated as
the deliverer of Gaul and the conqueror of the Germans. <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> This solemn
engagement, which seemed to be dictated by affection rather than by
duty, was singly opposed by Nebridius, who had been admitted to the
office of Praetorian praefect. That faithful minister, alone and
unassisted, asserted the rights of Constantius, in the midst of an armed
and angry multitude, to whose fury he had almost fallen an honorable,
but useless sacrifice. After losing one of his hands by the stroke of a
sword, he embraced the knees of the prince whom he had offended. Julian
covered the praefect with his Imperial mantle, and, protecting him from
the zeal of his followers, dismissed him to his own house, with less
respect than was perhaps due to the virtue of an enemy. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> The high
office of Nebridius was bestowed on Sallust; and the provinces of Gaul,
which were now delivered from the intolerable oppression of taxes,
enjoyed the mild and equitable administration of the friend of Julian,
who was permitted to practise those virtues which he had instilled into
the mind of his pupil. <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The hopes of Julian depended much less on the number of his troops, than
on the celerity of his motions. In the execution of a daring enterprise,
he availed himself of every precaution, as far as prudence could
suggest; and where prudence could no longer accompany his steps, he
trusted the event to valor and to fortune. In the neighborhood of Basil
he assembled and divided his army. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> One body, which consisted of ten
thousand men, was directed under the command of Nevitta, general of the
cavalry, to advance through the midland parts of Rhaetia and Noricum.
A similar division of troops, under the orders of Jovius and Jovinus,
prepared to follow the oblique course of the highways, through the Alps,
and the northern confines of Italy. The instructions to the generals
were conceived with energy and precision: to hasten their march in close
and compact columns, which, according to the disposition of the ground,
might readily be changed into any order of battle; to secure themselves
against the surprises of the night by strong posts and vigilant guards;
to prevent resistance by their unexpected arrival; to elude examination
by their sudden departure; to spread the opinion of their strength, and
the terror of his name; and to join their sovereign under the walls
of Sirmium. For himself Julian had reserved a more difficult and
extraordinary part. He selected three thousand brave and active
volunteers, resolved, like their leader, to cast behind them every hope
of a retreat; at the head of this faithful band, he fearlessly plunged
into the recesses of the Marcian, or Black Forest, which conceals the
sources of the Danube; <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> and, for many days, the fate of Julian
was unknown to the world. The secrecy of his march, his diligence, and
vigor, surmounted every obstacle; he forced his way over mountains and
morasses, occupied the bridges or swam the rivers, pursued his direct
course, <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> without reflecting whether he traversed the territory of
the Romans or of the Barbarians, and at length emerged, between Ratisbon
and Vienna, at the place where he designed to embark his troops on
the Danube. By a well-concerted stratagem, he seized a fleet of light
brigantines, <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> as it lay at anchor; secured a apply of coarse
provisions sufficient to satisfy the indelicate, and voracious, appetite
of a Gallic army; and boldly committed himself to the stream of the
Danube. The labors of the mariners, who plied their oars with incessant
diligence, and the steady continuance of a favorable wind, carried his
fleet above seven hundred miles in eleven days; <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> and he had already
disembarked his troops at Bononia, <a href="#note-3211" name="noteref-3211"><small>3211</small></a> only nineteen miles from
Sirmium, before his enemies could receive any certain intelligence that
he had left the banks of the Rhine. In the course of this long and
rapid navigation, the mind of Julian was fixed on the object of his
enterprise; and though he accepted the deputations of some cities, which
hastened to claim the merit of an early submission, he passed before the
hostile stations, which were placed along the river, without indulging
the temptation of signalizing a useless and ill-timed valor. The banks
of the Danube were crowded on either side with spectators, who gazed on
the military pomp, anticipated the importance of the event, and diffused
through the adjacent country the fame of a young hero, who advanced
with more than mortal speed at the head of the innumerable forces of the
West. Lucilian, who, with the rank of general of the cavalry, commanded
the military powers of Illyricum, was alarmed and perplexed by the
doubtful reports, which he could neither reject nor believe. He had
taken some slow and irresolute measures for the purpose of collecting
his troops, when he was surprised by Dagalaiphus, an active officer,
whom Julian, as soon as he landed at Bononia, had pushed forwards with
some light infantry. The captive general, uncertain of his life or
death, was hastily thrown upon a horse, and conducted to the presence of
Julian; who kindly raised him from the ground, and dispelled the terror
and amazement which seemed to stupefy his faculties. But Lucilian had no
sooner recovered his spirits, than he betrayed his want of discretion,
by presuming to admonish his conqueror that he had rashly ventured,
with a handful of men, to expose his person in the midst of his enemies.
"Reserve for your master Constantius these timid remonstrances," replied
Julian, with a smile of contempt: "when I gave you my purple to kiss,
I received you not as a counsellor, but as a suppliant." Conscious that
success alone could justify his attempt, and that boldness only could
command success, he instantly advanced, at the head of three thousand
soldiers, to attack the strongest and most populous city of the Illyrian
provinces. As he entered the long suburb of Sirmium, he was received
by the joyful acclamations of the army and people; who, crowned with
flowers, and holding lighted tapers in their hands, conducted their
acknowledged sovereign to his Imperial residence. Two days were devoted
to the public joy, which was celebrated by the games of the circus;
but, early on the morning of the third day, Julian marched to occupy the
narrow pass of Succi, in the defiles of Mount Haemus; which, almost in
the midway between Sirmium and Constantinople, separates the provinces
of Thrace and Dacia, by an abrupt descent towards the former, and a
gentle declivity on the side of the latter. <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> The defence of this
important post was intrusted to the brave Nevitta; who, as well as the
generals of the Italian division, successfully executed the plan of the
march and junction which their master had so ably conceived. <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a>

The homage which Julian obtained, from the fears or the inclination of
the people, extended far beyond the immediate effect of his arms. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a>
The praefectures of Italy and Illyricum were administered by Taurus and
Florentius, who united that important office with the vain honors of the
consulship; and as those magistrates had retired with precipitation to
the court of Asia, Julian, who could not always restrain the levity of
his temper, stigmatized their flight by adding, in all the Acts of
the Year, the epithet of fugitive to the names of the two consuls.
The provinces which had been deserted by their first magistrates
acknowledged the authority of an emperor, who, conciliating the
qualities of a soldier with those of a philosopher, was equally admired
in the camps of the Danube and in the cities of Greece. From his palace,
or, more properly, from his head-quarters of Sirmium and Naissus, he
distributed to the principal cities of the empire, a labored apology
for his own conduct; published the secret despatches of Constantius; and
solicited the judgment of mankind between two competitors, the one
of whom had expelled, and the other had invited, the Barbarians. <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a>
Julian, whose mind was deeply wounded by the reproach of ingratitude,
aspired to maintain, by argument as well as by arms, the superior merits
of his cause; and to excel, not only in the arts of war, but in those of
composition. His epistle to the senate and people of Athens <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> seems
to have been dictated by an elegant enthusiasm; which prompted him to
submit his actions and his motives to the degenerate Athenians of his
own times, with the same humble deference as if he had been pleading,
in the days of Aristides, before the tribunal of the Areopagus. His
application to the senate of Rome, which was still permitted to bestow
the titles of Imperial power, was agreeable to the forms of the expiring
republic. An assembly was summoned by Tertullus, praefect of the city;
the epistle of Julian was read; and, as he appeared to be master of
Italy his claims were admitted without a dissenting voice. His oblique
censure of the innovations of Constantine, and his passionate invective
against the vices of Constantius, were heard with less satisfaction;
and the senate, as if Julian had been present, unanimously exclaimed,
"Respect, we beseech you, the author of your own fortune." <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> An
artful expression, which, according to the chance of war, might be
differently explained; as a manly reproof of the ingratitude of the
usurper, or as a flattering confession, that a single act of such
benefit to the state ought to atone for all the failings of Constantius.

The intelligence of the march and rapid progress of Julian was speedily
transmitted to his rival, who, by the retreat of Sapor, had obtained
some respite from the Persian war. Disguising the anguish of his soul
under the semblance of contempt, Constantius professed his intention of
returning into Europe, and of giving chase to Julian; for he never spoke
of his military expedition in any other light than that of a hunting
party. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> In the camp of Hierapolis, in Syria, he communicated this
design to his army; slightly mentioned the guilt and rashness of the
Caesar; and ventured to assure them, that if the mutineers of Gaul
presumed to meet them in the field, they would be unable to sustain the
fire of their eyes, and the irresistible weight of their shout of onset.
The speech of the emperor was received with military applause, and
Theodotus, the president of the council of Hierapolis, requested, with
tears of adulation, that his city might be adorned with the head of
the vanquished rebel. <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> A chosen detachment was despatched away in
post-wagons, to secure, if it were yet possible, the pass of Succi;
the recruits, the horses, the arms, and the magazines, which had been
prepared against Sapor, were appropriated to the service of the civil
war; and the domestic victories of Constantius inspired his partisans
with the most sanguine assurances of success. The notary Gaudentius had
occupied in his name the provinces of Africa; the subsistence of
Rome was intercepted; and the distress of Julian was increased by
an unexpected event, which might have been productive of fatal
consequences. Julian had received the submission of two legions and a
cohort of archers, who were stationed at Sirmium; but he suspected, with
reason, the fidelity of those troops which had been distinguished by the
emperor; and it was thought expedient, under the pretence of the exposed
state of the Gallic frontier, to dismiss them from the most important
scene of action. They advanced, with reluctance, as far as the confines
of Italy; but as they dreaded the length of the way, and the savage
fierceness of the Germans, they resolved, by the instigation of one
of their tribunes, to halt at Aquileia, and to erect the banners of
Constantius on the walls of that impregnable city. The vigilance of
Julian perceived at once the extent of the mischief, and the necessity
of applying an immediate remedy. By his order, Jovinus led back a
part of the army into Italy; and the siege of Aquileia was formed with
diligence, and prosecuted with vigor. But the legionaries, who seemed to
have rejected the yoke of discipline, conducted the defence of the place
with skill and perseverance; vited the rest of Italy to imitate the
example of their courage and loyalty; and threatened the retreat of
Julian, if he should be forced to yield to the superior numbers of the
armies of the East. <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a>

</p>
<p>
But the humanity of Julian was preserved from the cruel alternative
which he pathetically laments, of destroying or of being himself
destroyed: and the seasonable death of Constantius delivered the Roman
empire from the calamities of civil war. The approach of winter could
not detain the monarch at Antioch; and his favorites durst not oppose
his impatient desire of revenge. A slight fever, which was perhaps
occasioned by the agitation of his spirits, was increased by the
fatigues of the journey; and Constantius was obliged to halt at the
little town of Mopsucrene, twelve miles beyond Tarsus, where he expired,
after a short illness, in the forty-fifth year of his age, and the
twenty-fourth of his reign. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> His genuine character, which was
composed of pride and weakness, of superstition and cruelty, has been
fully displayed in the preceding narrative of civil and ecclesiastical
events. The long abuse of power rendered him a considerable object in
the eyes of his contemporaries; but as personal merit can alone deserve
the notice of posterity, the last of the sons of Constantine may
be dismissed from the world, with the remark, that he inherited the
defects, without the abilities, of his father. Before Constantius
expired, he is said to have named Julian for his successor; nor does it
seem improbable, that his anxious concern for the fate of a young and
tender wife, whom he left with child, may have prevailed, in his last
moments, over the harsher passions of hatred and revenge. Eusebius, and
his guilty associates, made a faint attempt to prolong the reign of the
eunuchs, by the election of another emperor; but their intrigues were
rejected with disdain, by an army which now abhorred the thought of
civil discord; and two officers of rank were instantly despatched, to
assure Julian, that every sword in the empire would be drawn for his
service. The military designs of that prince, who had formed three
different attacks against Thrace, were prevented by this fortunate
event. Without shedding the blood of his fellow-citizens, he escaped
the dangers of a doubtful conflict, and acquired the advantages of a
complete victory. Impatient to visit the place of his birth, and the new
capital of the empire, he advanced from Naissus through the mountains
of Haemus, and the cities of Thrace. When he reached Heraclea, at the
distance of sixty miles, all Constantinople was poured forth to receive
him; and he made his triumphal entry amidst the dutiful acclamations
of the soldiers, the people, and the senate. At innumerable multitude
pressed around him with eager respect and were perhaps disappointed
when they beheld the small stature and simple garb of a hero, whose
unexperienced youth had vanquished the Barbarians of Germany, and
who had now traversed, in a successful career, the whole continent of
Europe, from the shores of the Atlantic to those of the Bosphorus. <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a>
A few days afterwards, when the remains of the deceased emperor were
landed in the harbor, the subjects of Julian applauded the real or
affected humanity of their sovereign. On foot, without his diadem, and
clothed in a mourning habit, he accompanied the funeral as far as the
church of the Holy Apostles, where the body was deposited: and if these
marks of respect may be interpreted as a selfish tribute to the birth
and dignity of his Imperial kinsman, the tears of Julian professed
to the world that he had forgot the injuries, and remembered only the
obligations, which he had received from Constantius. <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> As soon as
the legions of Aquileia were assured of the death of the emperor, they
opened the gates of the city, and, by the sacrifice of their guilty
leaders, obtained an easy pardon from the prudence or lenity of Julian;
who, in the thirty-second year of his age, acquired the undisputed
possession of the Roman empire. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXII: Julian Declared Emperor.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
Philosophy had instructed Julian to compare the advantages of action
and retirement; but the elevation of his birth, and the accidents of
his life, never allowed him the freedom of choice. He might perhaps
sincerely have preferred the groves of the academy, and the society of
Athens; but he was constrained, at first by the will, and afterwards
by the injustice, of Constantius, to expose his person and fame to the
dangers of Imperial greatness; and to make himself accountable to the
world, and to posterity, for the happiness of millions. <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> Julian
recollected with terror the observation of his master Plato, <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> that
the government of our flocks and herds is always committed to beings
of a superior species; and that the conduct of nations requires and
deserves the celestial powers of the gods or of the genii. From this
principle he justly concluded, that the man who presumes to reign,
should aspire to the perfection of the divine nature; that he should
purify his soul from her mortal and terrestrial part; that he should
extinguish his appetites, enlighten his understanding, regulate his
passions, and subdue the wild beast, which, according to the lively
metaphor of Aristotle, <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> seldom fails to ascend the throne of a
despot. The throne of Julian, which the death of Constantius fixed on
an independent basis, was the seat of reason, of virtue, and perhaps of
vanity. He despised the honors, renounced the pleasures, and discharged
with incessant diligence the duties, of his exalted station; and there
were few among his subjects who would have consented to relieve him from
the weight of the diadem, had they been obliged to submit their time
and their actions to the rigorous laws which that philosophic emperor
imposed on himself. One of his most intimate friends, <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> who had often
shared the frugal simplicity of his table, has remarked, that his light
and sparing diet (which was usually of the vegetable kind) left his mind
and body always free and active, for the various and important business
of an author, a pontiff, a magistrate, a general, and a prince. In one
and the same day, he gave audience to several ambassadors, and wrote,
or dictated, a great number of letters to his generals, his civil
magistrates, his private friends, and the different cities of his
dominions. He listened to the memorials which had been received,
considered the subject of the petitions, and signified his intentions
more rapidly than they could be taken in short-hand by the diligence
of his secretaries. He possessed such flexibility of thought, and such
firmness of attention, that he could employ his hand to write, his ear
to listen, and his voice to dictate; and pursue at once three several
trains of ideas without hesitation, and without error. While his
ministers reposed, the prince flew with agility from one labor to
another, and, after a hasty dinner, retired into his library, till the
public business, which he had appointed for the evening, summoned him to
interrupt the prosecution of his studies. The supper of the emperor was
still less substantial than the former meal; his sleep was never clouded
by the fumes of indigestion; and except in the short interval of a
marriage, which was the effect of policy rather than love, the chaste
Julian never shared his bed with a female companion. <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> He was
soon awakened by the entrance of fresh secretaries, who had slept the
preceding day; and his servants were obliged to wait alternately
while their indefatigable master allowed himself scarcely any other
refreshment than the change of occupation. The predecessors of Julian,
his uncle, his brother, and his cousin, indulged their puerile taste for
the games of the Circus, under the specious pretence of complying
with the inclinations of the people; and they frequently remained
the greatest part of the day as idle spectators, and as a part of the
splendid spectacle, till the ordinary round of twenty-four races <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a>
was completely finished. On solemn festivals, Julian, who felt and
professed an unfashionable dislike to these frivolous amusements,
condescended to appear in the Circus; and after bestowing a careless
glance at five or six of the races, he hastily withdrew with the
impatience of a philosopher, who considered every moment as lost that
was not devoted to the advantage of the public or the improvement of his
own mind. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> By this avarice of time, he seemed to protract the short
duration of his reign; and if the dates were less securely ascertained,
we should refuse to believe, that only sixteen months elapsed between
the death of Constantius and the departure of his successor for the
Persian war. The actions of Julian can only be preserved by the care
of the historian; but the portion of his voluminous writings, which is
still extant, remains as a monument of the application, as well as of
the genius, of the emperor. The Misopogon, the Caesars, several of his
orations, and his elaborate work against the Christian religion, were
composed in the long nights of the two winters, the former of which he
passed at Constantinople, and the latter at Antioch.

<p>
The reformation of the Imperial court was one of the first and most
necessary acts of the government of Julian. <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> Soon after his entrance
into the palace of Constantinople, he had occasion for the service of
a barber. An officer, magnificently dressed, immediately presented
himself. "It is a barber," exclaimed the prince, with affected surprise,
"that I want, and not a receiver-general of the finances." <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> He
questioned the man concerning the profits of his employment and was
informed, that besides a large salary, and some valuable perquisites,
he enjoyed a daily allowance for twenty servants, and as many horses.
A thousand barbers, a thousand cup-bearers, a thousand cooks, were
distributed in the several offices of luxury; and the number of eunuchs
could be compared only with the insects of a summer's day. The monarch
who resigned to his subjects the superiority of merit and virtue, was
distinguished by the oppressive magnificence of his dress, his table,
his buildings, and his train. The stately palaces erected by Constantine
and his sons, were decorated with many colored marbles, and ornaments of
massy gold. The most exquisite dainties were procured, to gratify their
pride, rather than their taste; birds of the most distant climates, fish
from the most remote seas, fruits out of their natural season, winter
roses, and summer snows. <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> The domestic crowd of the palace surpassed
the expense of the legions; yet the smallest part of this costly
multitude was subservient to the use, or even to the splendor, of the
throne. The monarch was disgraced, and the people was injured, by the
creation and sale of an infinite number of obscure, and even titular
employments; and the most worthless of mankind might purchase the
privilege of being maintained, without the necessity of labor, from the
public revenue. The waste of an enormous household, the increase of
fees and perquisites, which were soon claimed as a lawful debt, and
the bribes which they extorted from those who feared their enmity, or
solicited their favor, suddenly enriched these haughty menials. They
abused their fortune, without considering their past, or their future,
condition; and their rapine and venality could be equalled only by the
extravagance of their dissipations. Their silken robes were embroidered
with gold, their tables were served with delicacy and profusion; the
houses which they built for their own use, would have covered the farm
of an ancient consul; and the most honorable citizens were obliged to
dismount from their horses, and respectfully to salute a eunuch whom
they met on the public highway. The luxury of the palace excited the
contempt and indignation of Julian, who usually slept on the ground, who
yielded with reluctance to the indispensable calls of nature; and who
placed his vanity, not in emulating, but in despising, the pomp of
royalty.

By the total extirpation of a mischief which was magnified even beyond
its real extent, he was impatient to relieve the distress, and to
appease the murmurs of the people; who support with less uneasiness the
weight of taxes, if they are convinced that the fruits of their industry
are appropriated to the service of the state. But in the execution of
this salutary work, Julian is accused of proceeding with too much haste
and inconsiderate severity. By a single edict, he reduced the palace
of Constantinople to an immense desert, and dismissed with ignominy the
whole train of slaves and dependants, <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> without providing any just,
or at least benevolent, exceptions, for the age, the services, or the
poverty, of the faithful domestics of the Imperial family. Such indeed
was the temper of Julian, who seldom recollected the fundamental maxim
of Aristotle, that true virtue is placed at an equal distance between
the opposite vices.
</p>
<p>
The splendid and effeminate dress of the Asiatics, the curls and paint,
the collars and bracelets, which had appeared so ridiculous in the
person of Constantine, were consistently rejected by his philosophic
successor. But with the fopperies, Julian affected to renounce the
decencies of dress; and seemed to value himself for his neglect of the
laws of cleanliness. In a satirical performance, which was designed for
the public eye, the emperor descants with pleasure, and even with
pride, on the length of his nails, and the inky blackness of his hands;
protests, that although the greatest part of his body was covered
with hair, the use of the razor was confined to his head alone; and
celebrates, with visible complacency, the shaggy and populous <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a>
beard, which he fondly cherished, after the example of the philosophers
of Greece. Had Julian consulted the simple dictates of reason, the first

in the name of the French nation, not to translate this passage, so
offensive to their delicacy, (Hist. de Jovien, tom. ii. p. 94.) Like
him, I have contented myself with a transient allusion; but the little
animal which Julian names, is a beast familiar to man, and signifies
love.]
</p>
<p>
But the work of public reformation would have remained imperfect, if
Julian had only corrected the abuses, without punishing the crimes, of
his predecessor's reign. "We are now delivered," says he, in a familiar
letter to one of his intimate friends, "we are now surprisingly
delivered from the voracious jaws of the Hydra. <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> I do not mean to
apply the epithet to my brother Constantius. He is no more; may the
earth lie light on his head! But his artful and cruel favorites studied
to deceive and exasperate a prince, whose natural mildness cannot
be praised without some efforts of adulation. It is not, however, my
intention, that even those men should be oppressed: they are accused,
and they shall enjoy the benefit of a fair and impartial trial." To
conduct this inquiry, Julian named six judges of the highest rank in the
state and army; and as he wished to escape the reproach of condemning
his personal enemies, he fixed this extraordinary tribunal at
Chalcedon, on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus; and transferred to the
commissioners an absolute power to pronounce and execute their final
sentence, without delay, and without appeal. The office of president was
exercised by the venerable praefect of the East, a second Sallust, <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a>
whose virtues conciliated the esteem of Greek sophists, and of Christian
bishops. He was assisted by the eloquent Mamertinus, <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> one of the
consuls elect, whose merit is loudly celebrated by the doubtful evidence
of his own applause. But the civil wisdom of two magistrates was
overbalanced by the ferocious violence of four generals, Nevitta, Agilo,
Jovinus, and Arbetio. Arbetio, whom the public would have seen with
less surprise at the bar than on the bench, was supposed to possess the
secret of the commission; the armed and angry leaders of the Jovian
and Herculian bands encompassed the tribunal; and the judges were
alternately swayed by the laws of justice, and by the clamors of
faction. <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The chamberlain Eusebius, who had so long abused the favor of
Constantius, expiated, by an ignominious death, the insolence, the
corruption, and cruelty of his servile reign. The executions of Paul
and Apodemius (the former of whom was burnt alive) were accepted as
an inadequate atonement by the widows and orphans of so many hundred
Romans, whom those legal tyrants had betrayed and murdered. But justice
herself (if we may use the pathetic expression of Ammianus) <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> appeared
to weep over the fate of Ursulus, the treasurer of the empire; and
his blood accused the ingratitude of Julian, whose distress had been
seasonably relieved by the intrepid liberality of that honest minister.
The rage of the soldiers, whom he had provoked by his indiscretion, was
the cause and the excuse of his death; and the emperor, deeply wounded
by his own reproaches and those of the public, offered some consolation
to the family of Ursulus, by the restitution of his confiscated
fortunes. Before the end of the year in which they had been adorned with
the ensigns of the prefecture and consulship, <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> Taurus and Florentius
were reduced to implore the clemency of the inexorable tribunal of
Chalcedon. The former was banished to Vercellae in Italy, and a sentence
of death was pronounced against the latter. A wise prince should have
rewarded the crime of Taurus: the faithful minister, when he was no
longer able to oppose the progress of a rebel, had taken refuge in
the court of his benefactor and his lawful sovereign. But the guilt of
Florentius justified the severity of the judges; and his escape served
to display the magnanimity of Julian, who nobly checked the interested
diligence of an informer, and refused to learn what place concealed the
wretched fugitive from his just resentment. <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> Some months after the
tribunal of Chalcedon had been dissolved, the praetorian vicegerent of
Africa, the notary Gaudentius, and Artemius <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> duke of Egypt, were
executed at Antioch. Artemius had reigned the cruel and corrupt tyrant
of a great province; Gaudentius had long practised the arts of calumny
against the innocent, the virtuous, and even the person of Julian
himself. Yet the circumstances of their trial and condemnation were
so unskillfully managed, that these wicked men obtained, in the public
opinion, the glory of suffering for the obstinate loyalty with which
they had supported the cause of Constantius. The rest of his servants
were protected by a general act of oblivion; and they were left to enjoy
with impunity the bribes which they had accepted, either to defend the
oppressed, or to oppress the friendless. This measure, which, on the
soundest principles of policy, may deserve our approbation, was executed
in a manner which seemed to degrade the majesty of the throne. Julian
was tormented by the importunities of a multitude, particularly of
Egyptians, who loudly redemanded the gifts which they had imprudently
or illegally bestowed; he foresaw the endless prosecution of vexatious
suits; and he engaged a promise, which ought always to have been sacred,
that if they would repair to Chalcedon, he would meet them in person, to
hear and determine their complaints. But as soon as they were landed,
he issued an absolute order, which prohibited the watermen from
transporting any Egyptian to Constantinople; and thus detained his
disappointed clients on the Asiatic shore till, their patience and money
being utterly exhausted, they were obliged to return with indignant
murmurs to their native country. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXII: Julian Declared Emperor.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
The numerous army of spies, of agents, and informers enlisted by
Constantius to secure the repose of one man, and to interrupt that of
millions, was immediately disbanded by his generous successor. Julian
was slow in his suspicions, and gentle in his punishments; and his
contempt of treason was the result of judgment, of vanity, and of
courage. Conscious of superior merit, he was persuaded that few among
his subjects would dare to meet him in the field, to attempt his life,
or even to seat themselves on his vacant throne. The philosopher could
excuse the hasty sallies of discontent; and the hero could despise the
ambitious projects which surpassed the fortune or the abilities of the
rash conspirators. A citizen of Ancyra had prepared for his own use a
purple garment; and this indiscreet action, which, under the reign of
Constantius, would have been considered as a capital offence, <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> was
reported to Julian by the officious importunity of a private enemy. The
monarch, after making some inquiry into the rank and character of
his rival, despatched the informer with a present of a pair of purple
slippers, to complete the magnificence of his Imperial habit. A more
dangerous conspiracy was formed by ten of the domestic guards, who had
resolved to assassinate Julian in the field of exercise near Antioch.
Their intemperance revealed their guilt; and they were conducted in
chains to the presence of their injured sovereign, who, after a lively
representation of the wickedness and folly of their enterprise, instead
of a death of torture, which they deserved and expected, pronounced a
sentence of exile against the two principal offenders. The only instance
in which Julian seemed to depart from his accustomed clemency, was the
execution of a rash youth, who, with a feeble hand, had aspired to
seize the reins of empire. But that youth was the son of Marcellus, the
general of cavalry, who, in the first campaign of the Gallic war, had
deserted the standard of the Caesar and the republic. Without appearing
to indulge his personal resentment, Julian might easily confound
the crime of the son and of the father; but he was reconciled by the
distress of Marcellus, and the liberality of the emperor endeavored to
heal the wound which had been inflicted by the hand of justice. <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a>

</p>
<p>
Julian was not insensible of the advantages of freedom. <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> From his
studies he had imbibed the spirit of ancient sages and heroes; his
life and fortunes had depended on the caprice of a tyrant; and when
he ascended the throne, his pride was sometimes mortified by the
reflection, that the slaves who would not dare to censure his defects
were not worthy to applaud his virtues. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> He sincerely abhorred the
system of Oriental despotism, which Diocletian, Constantine, and the
patient habits of fourscore years, had established in the empire. A
motive of superstition prevented the execution of the design, which
Julian had frequently meditated, of relieving his head from the weight
of a costly diadem; <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> but he absolutely refused the title of Dominus,
or Lord, <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> a word which was grown so familiar to the ears of the
Romans, that they no longer remembered its servile and humiliating
origin. The office, or rather the name, of consul, was cherished by a
prince who contemplated with reverence the ruins of the republic; and
the same behavior which had been assumed by the prudence of Augustus
was adopted by Julian from choice and inclination. On the calends of
January, at break of day, the new consuls, Mamertinus and Nevitta,
hastened to the palace to salute the emperor. As soon as he was informed
of their approach, he leaped from his throne, eagerly advanced to
meet them, and compelled the blushing magistrates to receive the
demonstrations of his affected humility. From the palace they proceeded
to the senate. The emperor, on foot, marched before their litters; and
the gazing multitude admired the image of ancient times, or secretly
blamed a conduct, which, in their eyes, degraded the majesty of the
purple. <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> But the behavior of Julian was uniformly supported. During
the games of the Circus, he had, imprudently or designedly, performed
the manumission of a slave in the presence of the consul. The moment
he was reminded that he had trespassed on the jurisdiction of another
magistrate, he condemned himself to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold;
and embraced this public occasion of declaring to the world, that he
was subject, like the rest of his fellow-citizens, to the laws, <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> and
even to the forms, of the republic. The spirit of his administration,
and his regard for the place of his nativity, induced Julian to confer
on the senate of Constantinople the same honors, privileges, and
authority, which were still enjoyed by the senate of ancient Rome. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a>
A legal fiction was introduced, and gradually established, that one half
of the national council had migrated into the East; and the despotic
successors of Julian, accepting the title of Senators, acknowledged
themselves the members of a respectable body, which was permitted
to represent the majesty of the Roman name. From Constantinople, the
attention of the monarch was extended to the municipal senates of the
provinces. He abolished, by repeated edicts, the unjust and pernicious
exemptions which had withdrawn so many idle citizens from the services
of their country; and by imposing an equal distribution of public
duties, he restored the strength, the splendor, or, according to the
glowing expression of Libanius, <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> the soul of the expiring cities
of his empire. The venerable age of Greece excited the most tender
compassion in the mind of Julian, which kindled into rapture when he
recollected the gods, the heroes, and the men superior to heroes and to
gods, who have bequeathed to the latest posterity the monuments of their
genius, or the example of their virtues. He relieved the distress, and
restored the beauty, of the cities of Epirus and Peloponnesus. <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a>
Athens acknowledged him for her benefactor; Argos, for her deliverer.
The pride of Corinth, again rising from her ruins with the honors of
a Roman colony, exacted a tribute from the adjacent republics, for the
purpose of defraying the games of the Isthmus, which were celebrated
in the amphitheatre with the hunting of bears and panthers. From this
tribute the cities of Elis, of Delphi, and of Argos, which had inherited
from their remote ancestors the sacred office of perpetuating the
Olympic, the Pythian, and the Nemean games, claimed a just exemption.
The immunity of Elis and Delphi was respected by the Corinthians; but
the poverty of Argos tempted the insolence of oppression; and the feeble
complaints of its deputies were silenced by the decree of a provincial
magistrate, who seems to have consulted only the interest of the capital
in which he resided. Seven years after this sentence, Julian <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a>
allowed the cause to be referred to a superior tribunal; and his
eloquence was interposed, most probably with success, in the defence of
a city, which had been the royal seat of Agamemnon, <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> and had given
to Macedonia a race of kings and conquerors. <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The laborious administration of military and civil affairs, which were
multiplied in proportion to the extent of the empire, exercised the
abilities of Julian; but he frequently assumed the two characters of
Orator <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a> and of Judge, <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> which are almost unknown to the modern
sovereigns of Europe. The arts of persuasion, so diligently cultivated
by the first Caesars, were neglected by the military ignorance and
Asiatic pride of their successors; and if they condescended to harangue
the soldiers, whom they feared, they treated with silent disdain the
senators, whom they despised. The assemblies of the senate, which
Constantius had avoided, were considered by Julian as the place where he
could exhibit, with the most propriety, the maxims of a republican, and
the talents of a rhetorician. He alternately practised, as in a school
of declamation, the several modes of praise, of censure, of exhortation;
and his friend Libanius has remarked, that the study of Homer taught
him to imitate the simple, concise style of Menelaus, the copiousness of
Nestor, whose words descended like the flakes of a winter's snow, or the
pathetic and forcible eloquence of Ulysses. The functions of a judge,
which are sometimes incompatible with those of a prince, were exercised
by Julian, not only as a duty, but as an amusement; and although he
might have trusted the integrity and discernment of his Praetorian
praefects, he often placed himself by their side on the seat of
judgment. The acute penetration of his mind was agreeably occupied in
detecting and defeating the chicanery of the advocates, who labored to
disguise the truths of facts, and to pervert the sense of the laws.
He sometimes forgot the gravity of his station, asked indiscreet or
unseasonable questions, and betrayed, by the loudness of his voice,
and the agitation of his body, the earnest vehemence with which he
maintained his opinion against the judges, the advocates, and their
clients. But his knowledge of his own temper prompted him to encourage,
and even to solicit, the reproof of his friends and ministers; and
whenever they ventured to oppose the irregular sallies of his passions,
the spectators could observe the shame, as well as the gratitude, of
their monarch. The decrees of Julian were almost always founded on the
principles of justice; and he had the firmness to resist the two most
dangerous temptations, which assault the tribunal of a sovereign, under
the specious forms of compassion and equity. He decided the merits of
the cause without weighing the circumstances of the parties; and the
poor, whom he wished to relieve, were condemned to satisfy the just
demands of a wealthy and noble adversary. He carefully distinguished
the judge from the legislator; <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> and though he meditated a necessary
reformation of the Roman jurisprudence, he pronounced sentence according
to the strict and literal interpretation of those laws, which the
magistrates were bound to execute, and the subjects to obey.

cast naked into the world, would immediately sink to the lowest rank
of society, without a hope of emerging from their obscurity. But the
personal merit of Julian was, in some measure, independent of his
fortune. Whatever had been his choice of life, by the force of intrepid
courage, lively wit, and intense application, he would have obtained, or
at least he would have deserved, the highest honors of his profession;
and Julian might have raised himself to the rank of minister, or
general, of the state in which he was born a private citizen. If the
jealous caprice of power had disappointed his expectations, if he had
prudently declined the paths of greatness, the employment of the same
talents in studious solitude would have placed beyond the reach of
kings his present happiness and his immortal fame. When we inspect,
with minute, or perhaps malevolent attention, the portrait of Julian,
something seems wanting to the grace and perfection of the whole figure.
His genius was less powerful and sublime than that of Caesar; nor did
he possess the consummate prudence of Augustus. The virtues of Trajan
appear more steady and natural, and the philosophy of Marcus is more
simple and consistent. Yet Julian sustained adversity with firmness, and
prosperity with moderation. After an interval of one hundred and twenty
years from the death of Alexander Severus, the Romans beheld an emperor
who made no distinction between his duties and his pleasures; who
labored to relieve the distress, and to revive the spirit, of his
subjects; and who endeavored always to connect authority with merit,
and happiness with virtue. Even faction, and religious faction, was
constrained to acknowledge the superiority of his genius, in peace as
well as in war, and to confess, with a sigh, that the apostate Julian
was a lover of his country, and that he deserved the empire of the
world. <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a>
