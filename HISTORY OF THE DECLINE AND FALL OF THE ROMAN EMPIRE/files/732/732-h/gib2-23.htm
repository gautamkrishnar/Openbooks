<p>
The character of Apostate has injured the reputation of Julian; and the
enthusiasm which clouded his virtues has exaggerated the real and
apparent magnitude of his faults. Our partial ignorance may represent
him as a philosophic monarch, who studied to protect, with an equal
hand, the religious factions of the empire; and to allay the theological
fever which had inflamed the minds of the people, from the edicts of
Diocletian to the exile of Athanasius. A more accurate view of the
character and conduct of Julian will remove this favorable prepossession
for a prince who did not escape the general contagion of the times. We
enjoy the singular advantage of comparing the pictures which have been
delineated by his fondest admirers and his implacable enemies. The
actions of Julian are faithfully related by a judicious and candid
historian, the impartial spectator of his life and death. The unanimous
evidence of his contemporaries is confirmed by the public and private
declarations of the emperor himself; and his various writings express
the uniform tenor of his religious sentiments, which policy would have
prompted him to dissemble rather than to affect. A devout and sincere
attachment for the gods of Athens and Rome constituted the ruling
passion of Julian; <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> the powers of an enlightened understanding were
betrayed and corrupted by the influence of superstitious prejudice; and
the phantoms which existed only in the mind of the emperor had a real
and pernicious effect on the government of the empire. The vehement zeal
of the Christians, who despised the worship, and overturned the
altars of those fabulous deities, engaged their votary in a state of
irreconcilable hostility with a very numerous party of his subjects;
and he was sometimes tempted by the desire of victory, or the shame of
a repulse, to violate the laws of prudence, and even of justice. The
triumph of the party, which he deserted and opposed, has fixed a stain
of infamy on the name of Julian; and the unsuccessful apostate has been
overwhelmed with a torrent of pious invectives, of which the signal
was given by the sonorous trumpet <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> of Gregory Nazianzen. <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> The
interesting nature of the events which were crowded into the short reign
of this active emperor, deserve a just and circumstantial narrative.
His motives, his counsels, and his actions, as far as they are connected
with the history of religion, will be the subject of the present
chapter.

[ I shall transcribe some of his own expressions from a short
religious discourse which the Imperial pontiff composed to censure the
bold impiety of a Cynic. Orat. vii. p. 212. The variety and copiousness
of the Greek tongue seem inadequate to the fervor of his devotion.]

[ The orator, with some eloquence, much enthusiasm, and more
vanity, addresses his discourse to heaven and earth, to men and angels,
to the living and the dead; and above all, to the great Constantius, an
odd Pagan expression. He concludes with a bold assurance, that he has
erected a monument not less durable, and much more portable, than the
columns of Hercules. See Greg. Nazianzen, Orat. iii. p. 50, iv. p. 134.]

[ See this long invective, which has been injudiciously
divided into two orations in Gregory's works, tom. i. p. 49-134, Paris,
1630. It was published by Gregory and his friend Basil, (iv. p. 133,)
about six months after the death of Julian, when his remains had been
carried to Tarsus, (iv. p. 120;) but while Jovian was still on the
throne, (iii. p. 54, iv. p. 117) I have derived much assistance from a
French version and remarks, printed at Lyons, 1735.]
</p>
<p>
The cause of his strange and fatal apostasy may be derived from the
early period of his life, when he was left an orphan in the hands of
the murderers of his family. The names of Christ and of Constantius,
the ideas of slavery and of religion, were soon associated in a youthful
imagination, which was susceptible of the most lively impressions. The
care of his infancy was intrusted to Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia,
<a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> who was related to him on the side of his mother; and till Julian
reached the twentieth year of his age, he received from his Christian
preceptors the education, not of a hero, but of a saint. The emperor,
less jealous of a heavenly than of an earthly crown, contented himself
with the imperfect character of a catechumen, while he bestowed the
advantages of baptism <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> on the nephews of Constantine. <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> They were
even admitted to the inferior offices of the ecclesiastical order; and
Julian publicly read the Holy Scriptures in the church of Nicomedia.
The study of religion, which they assiduously cultivated, appeared to
produce the fairest fruits of faith and devotion. <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> They prayed, they
fasted, they distributed alms to the poor, gifts to the clergy, and
oblations to the tombs of the martyrs; and the splendid monument of
St. Mamas, at Caesarea, was erected, or at least was undertaken, by the
joint labor of Gallus and Julian. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> They respectfully conversed with
the bishops, who were eminent for superior sanctity, and solicited the
benediction of the monks and hermits, who had introduced into Cappadocia
the voluntary hardships of the ascetic life. <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> As the two princes
advanced towards the years of manhood, they discovered, in their
religious sentiments, the difference of their characters. The dull and
obstinate understanding of Gallus embraced, with implicit zeal, the
doctrines of Christianity; which never influenced his conduct, or
moderated his passions. The mild disposition of the younger brother was
less repugnant to the precepts of the gospel; and his active curiosity
might have been gratified by a theological system, which explains the
mysterious essence of the Deity, and opens the boundless prospect
of invisible and future worlds. But the independent spirit of Julian
refused to yield the passive and unresisting obedience which was
required, in the name of religion, by the haughty ministers of the
church. Their speculative opinions were imposed as positive laws, and
guarded by the terrors of eternal punishments; but while they prescribed
the rigid formulary of the thoughts, the words, and the actions of the
young prince; whilst they silenced his objections, and severely checked
the freedom of his inquiries, they secretly provoked his impatient
genius to disclaim the authority of his ecclesiastical guides. He
was educated in the Lesser Asia, amidst the scandals of the Arian
controversy. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> The fierce contests of the Eastern bishops, the
incessant alterations of their creeds, and the profane motives which
appeared to actuate their conduct, insensibly strengthened the prejudice
of Julian, that they neither understood nor believed the religion for
which they so fiercely contended. Instead of listening to the proofs of
Christianity with that favorable attention which adds weight to the
most respectable evidence, he heard with suspicion, and disputed with
obstinacy and acuteness, the doctrines for which he already entertained
an invincible aversion. Whenever the young princes were directed to
compose declamations on the subject of the prevailing controversies,
Julian always declared himself the advocate of Paganism; under the
specious excuse that, in the defence of the weaker cause, his learning
and ingenuity might be more advantageously exercised and displayed.

[ Nicomediae ab Eusebio educatus Episcopo, quem genere
longius contingebat, (Ammian. xxii. 9.) Julian never expresses any
gratitude towards that Arian prelate; but he celebrates his preceptor,
the eunuch Mardonius, and describes his mode of education, which
inspired his pupil with a passionate admiration for the genius, and
perhaps the religion of Homer. Misopogon, p. 351, 352.]

was prosecuted with vigor and success; but the earth obstinately
rejected and subverted the structures which were imposed by the
sacrilegious hand of Julian. Greg. iii. p. 59, 60, 61. Such a partial
earthquake, attested by many living spectators, would form one of the
clearest miracles in ecclesiastical story.]

[ The philosopher (Fragment, p. 288,) ridicules the iron
chains, &amp;c, of these solitary fanatics, (see Tillemont, Mem. Eccles.
tom. ix. p. 661, 632,) who had forgot that man is by nature a gentle and
social animal. The Pagan supposes, that because they had renounced the
gods, they were possessed and tormented by evil daemons.]

[ See Julian apud Cyril, l. vi. p. 206, l. viii. p. 253,
262. "You persecute," says he, "those heretics who do not mourn the
dead man precisely in the way which you approve." He shows himself a
tolerable theologian; but he maintains that the Christian Trinity is not
derived from the doctrine of Paul, of Jesus, or of Moses.]
</p>
<p>
As soon as Gallus was invested with the honors of the purple, Julian was
permitted to breathe the air of freedom, of literature, and of Paganism.
<a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> The crowd of sophists, who were attracted by the taste and
liberality of their royal pupil, had formed a strict alliance between
the learning and the religion of Greece; and the poems of Homer, instead
of being admired as the original productions of human genius, were
seriously ascribed to the heavenly inspiration of Apollo and the muses.
The deities of Olympus, as they are painted by the immortal bard,
imprint themselves on the minds which are the least addicted to
superstitious credulity. Our familiar knowledge of their names and
characters, their forms and attributes, seems to bestow on those airy
beings a real and substantial existence; and the pleasing enchantment
produces an imperfect and momentary assent of the imagination to those
fables, which are the most repugnant to our reason and experience. In
the age of Julian, every circumstance contributed to prolong and fortify
the illusion; the magnificent temples of Greece and Asia; the works of
those artists who had expressed, in painting or in sculpture, the divine
conceptions of the poet; the pomp of festivals and sacrifices; the
successful arts of divination; the popular traditions of oracles and
prodigies; and the ancient practice of two thousand years. The weakness
of polytheism was, in some measure, excused by the moderation of its
claims; and the devotion of the Pagans was not incompatible with the
most licentious scepticism. <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> Instead of an indivisible and regular
system, which occupies the whole extent of the believing mind, the
mythology of the Greeks was composed of a thousand loose and flexible
parts, and the servant of the gods was at liberty to define the degree
and measure of his religious faith. The creed which Julian adopted
for his own use was of the largest dimensions; and, by strange
contradiction, he disdained the salutary yoke of the gospel, whilst he
made a voluntary offering of his reason on the altars of Jupiter and
Apollo. One of the orations of Julian is consecrated to the honor of
Cybele, the mother of the gods, who required from her effeminate priests
the bloody sacrifice, so rashly performed by the madness of the Phrygian
boy. The pious emperor condescends to relate, without a blush, and
without a smile, the voyage of the goddess from the shores of Pergamus
to the mouth of the Tyber, and the stupendous miracle, which convinced
the senate and people of Rome that the lump of clay, which their
ambassadors had transported over the seas, was endowed with life, and
sentiment, and divine power. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> For the truth of this prodigy he
appeals to the public monuments of the city; and censures, with some
acrimony, the sickly and affected taste of those men, who impertinently
derided the sacred traditions of their ancestors. <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a>

cleared her fame by disgracing the graver modesty of the Roman Indies,
is attested by a cloud of witnesses. Their evidence is collected by
Drakenborch, (ad Silium Italicum, xvii. 33;) but we may observe that
Livy (xxix. 14) slides over the transaction with discreet ambiguity.]

[ I cannot refrain from transcribing the emphatical words of
Julian: Orat. v. p. 161. Julian likewise declares his firm belief in
the ancilia, the holy shields, which dropped from heaven on the Quirinal
hill; and pities the strange blindness of the Christians, who preferred
the cross to these celestial trophies. Apud Cyril. l. vi. p. 194.]
</p>
<p>
But the devout philosopher, who sincerely embraced, and warmly
encouraged, the superstition of the people, reserved for himself the
privilege of a liberal interpretation; and silently withdrew from the
foot of the altars into the sanctuary of the temple. The extravagance of
the Grecian mythology proclaimed, with a clear and audible voice, that
the pious inquirer, instead of being scandalized or satisfied with the
literal sense, should diligently explore the occult wisdom, which had
been disguised, by the prudence of antiquity, under the mask of folly
and of fable. <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> The philosophers of the Platonic school, <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a>
Plotinus, Porphyry, and the divine Iamblichus, were admired as the most
skilful masters of this allegorical science, which labored to soften
and harmonize the deformed features of Paganism. Julian himself, who was
directed in the mysterious pursuit by Aedesius, the venerable successor
of Iamblichus, aspired to the possession of a treasure, which he
esteemed, if we may credit his solemn asseverations, far above the
empire of the world. <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> It was indeed a treasure, which derived its
value only from opinion; and every artist who flattered himself that he
had extracted the precious ore from the surrounding dross, claimed an
equal right of stamping the name and figure the most agreeable to his
peculiar fancy. The fable of Atys and Cybele had been already explained
by Porphyry; but his labors served only to animate the pious industry of
Julian, who invented and published his own allegory of that ancient and
mystic tale. This freedom of interpretation, which might gratify the
pride of the Platonists, exposed the vanity of their art. Without a
tedious detail, the modern reader could not form a just idea of the
strange allusions, the forced etymologies, the solemn trifling, and
the impenetrable obscurity of these sages, who professed to reveal
the system of the universe. As the traditions of Pagan mythology were
variously related, the sacred interpreters were at liberty to select
the most convenient circumstances; and as they translated an arbitrary
cipher, they could extract from any fable any sense which was adapted to
their favorite system of religion and philosophy. The lascivious form of
a naked Venus was tortured into the discovery of some moral precept, or
some physical truth; and the castration of Atys explained the revolution
of the sun between the tropics, or the separation of the human soul from
vice and error. <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a>

[ See the principles of allegory, in Julian, (Orat. vii.
p. 216, 222.) His reasoning is less absurd than that of some modern
theologians, who assert that an extravagant or contradictory doctrine
must be divine; since no man alive could have thought of inventing it.]

[ Eunapius has made these sophists the subject of a partial
and fanatical history; and the learned Brucker (Hist. Philosoph. tom.
ii. p. 217-303) has employed much labor to illustrate their obscure
lives and incomprehensible doctrines.]

<p class="foot">
<u>18</u> (<a href="#noteref-18">return</a>)<br>
[ See the fifth oration of Julian. But all the allegories
which ever issued from the Platonic school are not worth the short poem
of Catullus on the same extraordinary subject. The transition of Atys,
from the wildest enthusiasm to sober, pathetic complaint, for his
irretrievable loss, must inspire a man with pity, a eunuch with
despair.]
</p>
<p>
The theological system of Julian appears to have contained the sublime
and important principles of natural religion. But as the faith, which is
not founded on revelation, must remain destitute of any firm assurance,
the disciple of Plato imprudently relapsed into the habits of vulgar
superstition; and the popular and philosophic notion of the Deity seems
to have been confounded in the practice, the writings, and even in
the mind of Julian. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> The pious emperor acknowledged and adored the
Eternal Cause of the universe, to whom he ascribed all the perfections
of an infinite nature, invisible to the eyes and inaccessible to the
understanding, of feeble mortals. The Supreme God had created, or
rather, in the Platonic language, had generated, the gradual succession
of dependent spirits, of gods, of daemons, of heroes, and of men; and
every being which derived its existence immediately from the First
Cause, received the inherent gift of immortality. That so precious
an advantage might be lavished upon unworthy objects, the Creator had
intrusted to the skill and power of the inferior gods the office of
forming the human body, and of arranging the beautiful harmony of the
animal, the vegetable, and the mineral kingdoms. To the conduct of these
divine ministers he delegated the temporal government of this lower
world; but their imperfect administration is not exempt from discord
or error. The earth and its inhabitants are divided among them, and the
characters of Mars or Minerva, of Mercury or Venus, may be distinctly
traced in the laws and manners of their peculiar votaries. As long as
our immortal souls are confined in a mortal prison, it is our interest,
as well as our duty, to solicit the favor, and to deprecate the wrath,
of the powers of heaven; whose pride is gratified by the devotion
of mankind; and whose grosser parts may be supposed to derive some
nourishment from the fumes of sacrifice. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> The inferior gods might
sometimes condescend to animate the statues, and to inhabit the temples,
which were dedicated to their honor. They might occasionally visit the
earth, but the heavens were the proper throne and symbol of their glory.
The invariable order of the sun, moon, and stars, was hastily admitted
by Julian, as a proof of their eternal duration; and their eternity was
a sufficient evidence that they were the workmanship, not of an inferior
deity, but of the Omnipotent King. In the system of Platonists, the
visible was a type of the invisible world. The celestial bodies, as they
were informed by a divine spirit, might be considered as the objects
the most worthy of religious worship. The Sun, whose genial influence
pervades and sustains the universe, justly claimed the adoration of
mankind, as the bright representative of the Logos, the lively, the
rational, the beneficent image of the intellectual Father. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a>

[ The true religion of Julian may be deduced from the
Caesars, p. 308, with Spanheim's notes and illustrations, from
the fragments in Cyril, l. ii. p. 57, 58, and especially from the
theological oration in Solem Regem, p. 130-158, addressed in the
confidence of friendship, to the praefect Sallust.]

[ Julian adopts this gross conception by ascribing to his
favorite Marcus Antoninus, (Caesares, p. 333.) The Stoics and Platonists
hesitated between the analogy of bodies and the purity of spirits; yet
the gravest philosophers inclined to the whimsical fancy of Aristophanes
and Lucian, that an unbelieving age might starve the immortal gods. See
Observations de Spanheim, p. 284, 444, &amp;c.]

the Platonician Trinity; and only blames the Christians for preferring a
mortal to an immortal Logos.]
</p>
<p>
In every age, the absence of genuine inspiration is supplied by the
strong illusions of enthusiasm, and the mimic arts of imposture. If,
in the time of Julian, these arts had been practised only by the pagan
priests, for the support of an expiring cause, some indulgence might
perhaps be allowed to the interest and habits of the sacerdotal
character. But it may appear a subject of surprise and scandal, that
the philosophers themselves should have contributed to abuse the
superstitious credulity of mankind, <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> and that the Grecian mysteries
should have been supported by the magic or theurgy of the modern
Platonists. They arrogantly pretended to control the order of nature, to
explore the secrets of futurity, to command the service of the inferior
daemons, to enjoy the view and conversation of the superior gods, and by
disengaging the soul from her material bands, to reunite that immortal
particle with the Infinite and Divine Spirit.

</p>
<p>
The devout and fearless curiosity of Julian tempted the philosophers
with the hopes of an easy conquest; which, from the situation of their
young proselyte, might be productive of the most important consequences.
<a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> Julian imbibed the first rudiments of the Platonic doctrines from
the mouth of Aedesius, who had fixed at Pergamus his wandering and
persecuted school. But as the declining strength of that venerable sage
was unequal to the ardor, the diligence, the rapid conception of his
pupil, two of his most learned disciples, Chrysanthes and Eusebius,
supplied, at his own desire, the place of their aged master. These
philosophers seem to have prepared and distributed their respective
parts; and they artfully contrived, by dark hints and affected disputes,
to excite the impatient hopes of the aspirant, till they delivered him
into the hands of their associate, Maximus, the boldest and most skilful
master of the Theurgic science. By his hands, Julian was secretly
initiated at Ephesus, in the twentieth year of his age. His residence at
Athens confirmed this unnatural alliance of philosophy and superstition.
</p>
<p>
He obtained the privilege of a solemn initiation into the mysteries of
Eleusis, which, amidst the general decay of the Grecian worship, still
retained some vestiges of their primaeval sanctity; and such was the
zeal of Julian, that he afterwards invited the Eleusinian pontiff to the
court of Gaul, for the sole purpose of consummating, by mystic rites and
sacrifices, the great work of his sanctification. As these ceremonies
were performed in the depth of caverns, and in the silence of the night,
and as the inviolable secret of the mysteries was preserved by the
discretion of the initiated, I shall not presume to describe the horrid
sounds, and fiery apparitions, which were presented to the senses, or
the imagination, of the credulous aspirant, <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> till the visions of
comfort and knowledge broke upon him in a blaze of celestial light. <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a>
In the caverns of Ephesus and Eleusis, the mind of Julian was penetrated
with sincere, deep, and unalterable enthusiasm; though he might
sometimes exhibit the vicissitudes of pious fraud and hypocrisy, which
may be observed, or at least suspected, in the characters of the most
conscientious fanatics. From that moment he consecrated his life to the
service of the gods; and while the occupations of war, of government,
and of study, seemed to claim the whole measure of his time, a stated
portion of the hours of the night was invariably reserved for the
exercise of private devotion. The temperance which adorned the severe
manners of the soldier and the philosopher was connected with some
strict and frivolous rules of religious abstinence; and it was in honor
of Pan or Mercury, of Hecate or Isis, that Julian, on particular days,
denied himself the use of some particular food, which might have been
offensive to his tutelar deities. By these voluntary fasts, he prepared
his senses and his understanding for the frequent and familiar visits
with which he was honored by the celestial powers. Notwithstanding the
modest silence of Julian himself, we may learn from his faithful friend,
the orator Libanius, that he lived in a perpetual intercourse with
the gods and goddesses; that they descended upon earth to enjoy the
conversation of their favorite hero; that they gently interrupted his
slumbers by touching his hand or his hair; that they warned him of every
impending danger, and conducted him, by their infallible wisdom, in
every action of his life; and that he had acquired such an intimate
knowledge of his heavenly guests, as readily to distinguish the voice of
Jupiter from that of Minerva, and the form of Apollo from the figure of
Hercules. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> These sleeping or waking visions, the ordinary effects of
abstinence and fanaticism, would almost degrade the emperor to the level
of an Egyptian monk. But the useless lives of Antony or Pachomius were
consumed in these vain occupations. Julian could break from the dream
of superstition to arm himself for battle; and after vanquishing in the
field the enemies of Rome, he calmly retired into his tent, to dictate
the wise and salutary laws of an empire, or to indulge his genius in the
elegant pursuits of literature and philosophy.

<p>
The important secret of the apostasy of Julian was intrusted to the
fidelity of the initiated, with whom he was united by the sacred ties
of friendship and religion. <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> The pleasing rumor was cautiously
circulated among the adherents of the ancient worship; and his
future greatness became the object of the hopes, the prayers, and the
predictions of the Pagans, in every province of the empire. From the
zeal and virtues of their royal proselyte, they fondly expected the cure
of every evil, and the restoration of every blessing; and instead of
disapproving of the ardor of their pious wishes, Julian ingenuously
confessed, that he was ambitious to attain a situation in which he might
be useful to his country and to his religion. But this religion was
viewed with a hostile eye by the successor of Constantine, whose
capricious passions altercately saved and threatened the life of Julian.
The arts of magic and divination were strictly prohibited under a
despotic government, which condescended to fear them; and if the Pagans
were reluctantly indulged in the exercise of their superstition, the
rank of Julian would have excepted him from the general toleration. The
apostate soon became the presumptive heir of the monarchy, and his death
could alone have appeased the just apprehensions of the Christians. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a>
But the young prince, who aspired to the glory of a hero rather than of
a martyr, consulted his safety by dissembling his religion; and the easy
temper of polytheism permitted him to join in the public worship of a
sect which he inwardly despised. Libanius has considered the hypocrisy
of his friend as a subject, not of censure, but of praise. "As the
statues of the gods," says that orator, "which have been defiled with
filth, are again placed in a magnificent temple, so the beauty of truth
was seated in the mind of Julian, after it had been purified from the
errors and follies of his education. His sentiments were changed; but as
it would have been dangerous to have avowed his sentiments, his conduct
still continued the same. Very different from the ass in Aesop, who
disguised himself with a lion's hide, our lion was obliged to conceal
himself under the skin of an ass; and, while he embraced the dictates
of reason, to obey the laws of prudence and necessity." <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> The
dissimulation of Julian lasted about ten years, from his secret
initiation at Ephesus to the beginning of the civil war; when he
declared himself at once the implacable enemy of Christ and of
Constantius. This state of constraint might contribute to strengthen his
devotion; and as soon as he had satisfied the obligation of assisting,
on solemn festivals, at the assemblies of the Christians, Julian
returned, with the impatience of a lover, to burn his free and voluntary
incense on the domestic chapels of Jupiter and Mercury. But as every act
of dissimulation must be painful to an ingenuous spirit, the profession
of Christianity increased the aversion of Julian for a religion which
oppressed the freedom of his mind, and compelled him to hold a conduct
repugnant to the noblest attributes of human nature, sincerity and
courage.

    Chapter XXIII: Reign Of Julian.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
The inclination of Julian might prefer the gods of Homer, and of the
Scipios, to the new faith, which his uncle had established in the Roman
empire; and in which he himself had been sanctified by the sacrament of
baptism. But, as a philosopher, it was incumbent on him to justify his
dissent from Christianity, which was supported by the number of its
converts, by the chain of prophecy, the splendor of or miracles, and the
weight of evidence. The elaborate work, <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> which he composed amidst
the preparations of the Persian war, contained the substance of those
arguments which he had long revolved in his mind. Some fragments have
been transcribed and preserved, by his adversary, the vehement Cyril
of Alexandria; <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> and they exhibit a very singular mixture of wit and
learning, of sophistry and fanaticism. The elegance of the style and the
rank of the author, recommended his writings to the public attention;
<a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> and in the impious list of the enemies of Christianity, the
celebrated name of Porphyry was effaced by the superior merit or
reputation of Julian. The minds of the faithful were either seduced,
or scandalized, or alarmed; and the pagans, who sometimes presumed to
engage in the unequal dispute, derived, from the popular work of their
Imperial missionary, an inexhaustible supply of fallacious objections.
But in the assiduous prosecution of these theological studies, the
emperor of the Romans imbibed the illiberal prejudices and passions of a
polemic divine. He contracted an irrevocable obligation to maintain and
propagate his religious opinions; and whilst he secretly applauded the
strength and dexterity with which he wielded the weapons of
controversy, he was tempted to distrust the sincerity, or to despise
the understandings, of his antagonists, who could obstinately resist the
force of reason and eloquence.

Libanius cannot be accused of flattery to a dead prince.]
</p>
<p>
The Christians, who beheld with horror and indignation the apostasy of
Julian, had much more to fear from his power than from his arguments.
The pagans, who were conscious of his fervent zeal, expected, perhaps
with impatience, that the flames of persecution should be immediately
kindled against the enemies of the gods; and that the ingenious malice
of Julian would invent some cruel refinements of death and torture which
had been unknown to the rude and inexperienced fury of his predecessors.
But the hopes, as well as the fears, of the religious factions were
apparently disappointed, by the prudent humanity of a prince, <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> who
was careful of his own fame, of the public peace, and of the rights of
mankind. Instructed by history and reflection, Julian was persuaded,
that if the diseases of the body may sometimes be cured by salutary
violence, neither steel nor fire can eradicate the erroneous opinions of
the mind. The reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of the altar;
but the heart still abhors and disclaims the sacrilegious act of the
hand. Religious obstinacy is hardened and exasperated by oppression;
and, as soon as the persecution subsides, those who have yielded are
restored as penitents, and those who have resisted are honored as saints
and martyrs. If Julian adopted the unsuccessful cruelty of Diocletian
and his colleagues, he was sensible that he should stain his memory with
the name of a tyrant, and add new glories to the Catholic church,
which had derived strength and increase from the severity of the pagan
magistrates. Actuated by these motives, and apprehensive of disturbing
the repose of an unsettled reign, Julian surprised the world by an
edict, which was not unworthy of a statesman, or a philosopher. He
extended to all the inhabitants of the Roman world the benefits of a
free and equal toleration; and the only hardship which he inflicted on
the Christians, was to deprive them of the power of tormenting their
fellow-subjects, whom they stigmatized with the odious titles of
idolaters and heretics. The pagans received a gracious permission, or
rather an express order, to open All their temples; <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> and they were
at once delivered from the oppressive laws, and arbitrary vexations,
which they had sustained under the reign of Constantine, and of his
sons. At the same time the bishops and clergy, who had been banished
by the Arian monarch, were recalled from exile, and restored to their
respective churches; the Donatists, the Novatians, the Macedonians, the
Eunomians, and those who, with a more prosperous fortune, adhered to
the doctrine of the Council of Nice. Julian, who understood and derided
their theological disputes, invited to the palace the leaders of the
hostile sects, that he might enjoy the agreeable spectacle of their
furious encounters. The clamor of controversy sometimes provoked
the emperor to exclaim, "Hear me! the Franks have heard me, and the
Alemanni;" but he soon discovered that he was now engaged with more
obstinate and implacable enemies; and though he exerted the powers of
oratory to persuade them to live in concord, or at least in peace, he
was perfectly satisfied, before he dismissed them from his presence,
that he had nothing to dread from the union of the Christians. The
impartial Ammianus has ascribed this affected clemency to the desire
of fomenting the intestine divisions of the church, and the insidious
design of undermining the foundations of Christianity, was inseparably
connected with the zeal which Julian professed, to restore the ancient
religion of the empire. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a>

<p>
As soon as he ascended the throne, he assumed, according to the custom
of his predecessors, the character of supreme pontiff; not only as
the most honorable title of Imperial greatness, but as a sacred and
important office; the duties of which he was resolved to execute with
pious diligence. As the business of the state prevented the emperor from
joining every day in the public devotion of his subjects, he dedicated
a domestic chapel to his tutelar deity the Sun; his gardens were filled
with statues and altars of the gods; and each apartment of the palace
displaced the appearance of a magnificent temple. Every morning he
saluted the parent of light with a sacrifice; the blood of another
victim was shed at the moment when the Sun sunk below the horizon;
and the Moon, the Stars, and the Genii of the night received their
respective and seasonable honors from the indefatigable devotion of
Julian. On solemn festivals, he regularly visited the temple of the god
or goddess to whom the day was peculiarly consecrated, and endeavored to
excite the religion of the magistrates and people by the example of
his own zeal. Instead of maintaining the lofty state of a monarch,
distinguished by the splendor of his purple, and encompassed by
the golden shields of his guards, Julian solicited, with respectful
eagerness, the meanest offices which contributed to the worship of the
gods. Amidst the sacred but licentious crowd of priests, of inferior
ministers, and of female dancers, who were dedicated to the service of
the temple, it was the business of the emperor to bring the wood,
to blow the fire, to handle the knife, to slaughter the victim, and,
thrusting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring animal, to
draw forth the heart or liver, and to read, with the consummate skill of
an haruspex, imaginary signs of future events. The wisest of the Pagans
censured this extravagant superstition, which affected to despise the
restraints of prudence and decency. Under the reign of a prince, who
practised the rigid maxims of economy, the expense of religious worship
consumed a very large portion of the revenue a constant supply of the
scarcest and most beautiful birds was transported from distant climates,
to bleed on the altars of the gods; a hundred oxen were frequently
sacrificed by Julian on one and the same day; and it soon became a
popular jest, that if he should return with conquest from the Persian
war, the breed of horned cattle must infallibly be extinguished. Yet
this expense may appear inconsiderable, when it is compared with the
splendid presents which were offered either by the hand, or by order,
of the emperor, to all the celebrated places of devotion in the Roman
world; and with the sums allotted to repair and decorate the ancient
temples, which had suffered the silent decay of time, or the
recent injuries of Christian rapine. Encouraged by the example, the
exhortations, the liberality, of their pious sovereign, the cities and
families resumed the practice of their neglected ceremonies. "Every part
of the world," exclaims Libanius, with devout transport, "displayed
the triumph of religion; and the grateful prospect of flaming altars,
bleeding victims, the smoke of incense, and a solemn train of priests
and prophets, without fear and without danger. The sound of prayer and
of music was heard on the tops of the highest mountains; and the same
ox afforded a sacrifice for the gods, and a supper for their joyous
votaries." <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a>

These writers agree in the essential, and even minute, facts; but the
different lights in which they view the extreme devotion of Julian, are
expressive of the gradations of self-applause, passionate admiration,
mild reproof, and partial invective.]
</p>
<p>
But the genius and power of Julian were unequal to the enterprise of
restoring a religion which was destitute of theological principles, of
moral precepts, and of ecclesiastical discipline; which rapidly hastened
to decay and dissolution, and was not susceptible of any solid or
consistent reformation. The jurisdiction of the supreme pontiff, more
especially after that office had been united with the Imperial dignity,
comprehended the whole extent of the Roman empire. Julian named for his
vicars, in the several provinces, the priests and philosophers whom he
esteemed the best qualified to cooperate in the execution of his great
design; and his pastoral letters, <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> if we may use that name, still
represent a very curious sketch of his wishes and intentions. He
directs, that in every city the sacerdotal order should be composed,
without any distinction of birth and fortune, of those persons who were
the most conspicuous for the love of the gods, and of men. "If they
are guilty," continues he, "of any scandalous offence, they should be
censured or degraded by the superior pontiff; but as long as they retain
their rank, they are entitled to the respect of the magistrates and
people. Their humility may be shown in the plainness of their domestic
garb; their dignity, in the pomp of holy vestments. When they are
summoned in their turn to officiate before the altar, they ought not,
during the appointed number of days, to depart from the precincts of
the temple; nor should a single day be suffered to elapse, without
the prayers and the sacrifice, which they are obliged to offer for
the prosperity of the state, and of individuals. The exercise of their
sacred functions requires an immaculate purity, both of mind and body;
and even when they are dismissed from the temple to the occupations of
common life, it is incumbent on them to excel in decency and virtue the
rest of their fellow-citizens. The priest of the gods should never be
seen in theatres or taverns. His conversation should be chaste, his
diet temperate, his friends of honorable reputation; and if he sometimes
visits the Forum or the Palace, he should appear only as the advocate
of those who have vainly solicited either justice or mercy. His studies
should be suited to the sanctity of his profession. Licentious tales,
or comedies, or satires, must be banished from his library, which ought
solely to consist of historical or philosophical writings; of history,
which is founded in truth, and of philosophy, which is connected with
religion. The impious opinions of the Epicureans and sceptics deserve
his abhorrence and contempt; <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> but he should diligently study the
systems of Pythagoras, of Plato, and of the Stoics, which unanimously
teach that there are gods; that the world is governed by their
providence; that their goodness is the source of every temporal
blessing; and that they have prepared for the human soul a future state
of reward or punishment." The Imperial pontiff inculcates, in the most
persuasive language, the duties of benevolence and hospitality; exhorts
his inferior clergy to recommend the universal practice of those
virtues; promises to assist their indigence from the public treasury;
and declares his resolution of establishing hospitals in every city,
where the poor should be received without any invidious distinction
of country or of religion. Julian beheld with envy the wise and humane
regulations of the church; and he very frankly confesses his intention
to deprive the Christians of the applause, as well as advantage, which
they had acquired by the exclusive practice of charity and beneficence.
<a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> The same spirit of imitation might dispose the emperor to adopt
several ecclesiastical institutions, the use and importance of which
were approved by the success of his enemies. But if these imaginary
plans of reformation had been realized, the forced and imperfect
copy would have been less beneficial to Paganism, than honorable to
Christianity. <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> The Gentiles, who peaceably followed the customs
of their ancestors, were rather surprised than pleased with the
introduction of foreign manners; and in the short period of his reign,

The enthusiasm of Julian prompted him to embrace the friends of Jupiter
as his personal friends and brethren; and though he partially overlooked
the merit of Christian constancy, he admired and rewarded the noble
perseverance of those Gentiles who had preferred the favor of the gods
to that of the emperor. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> If they cultivated the literature, as well
as the religion, of the Greeks, they acquired an additional claim to the
friendship of Julian, who ranked the Muses in the number of his tutelar
deities. In the religion which he had adopted, piety and learning were
almost synonymous; <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> and a crowd of poets, of rhetoricians, and
of philosophers, hastened to the Imperial court, to occupy the vacant
places of the bishops, who had seduced the credulity of Constantius. His
successor esteemed the ties of common initiation as far more sacred than
those of consanguinity; he chose his favorites among the sages, who were
deeply skilled in the occult sciences of magic and divination; and every
impostor, who pretended to reveal the secrets of futurity, was assured
of enjoying the present hour in honor and affluence. <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> Among the
philosophers, Maximus obtained the most eminent rank in the friendship
of his royal disciple, who communicated, with unreserved confidence, his
actions, his sentiments, and his religious designs, during the anxious
suspense of the civil war. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> As soon as Julian had taken possession
of the palace of Constantinople, he despatched an honorable and pressing
invitation to Maximus, who then resided at Sardes in Lydia, with
Chrysanthius, the associate of his art and studies. The prudent and
superstitious Chrysanthius refused to undertake a journey which showed
itself, according to the rules of divination, with the most threatening
and malignant aspect: but his companion, whose fanaticism was of a
bolder cast, persisted in his interrogations, till he had extorted from
the gods a seeming consent to his own wishes, and those of the emperor.
The journey of Maximus through the cities of Asia displayed the triumph
of philosophic vanity; and the magistrates vied with each other in
the honorable reception which they prepared for the friend of their
sovereign. Julian was pronouncing an oration before the senate, when
he was informed of the arrival of Maximus. The emperor immediately
interrupted his discourse, advanced to meet him, and after a tender
embrace, conducted him by the hand into the midst of the assembly; where
he publicly acknowledged the benefits which he had derived from the
instructions of the philosopher. Maximus, <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> who soon acquired the
confidence, and influenced the councils of Julian, was insensibly
corrupted by the temptations of a court. His dress became more splendid,
his demeanor more lofty, and he was exposed, under a succeeding reign,
to a disgraceful inquiry into the means by which the disciple of Plato
had accumulated, in the short duration of his favor, a very scandalous
proportion of wealth. Of the other philosophers and sophists, who were
invited to the Imperial residence by the choice of Julian, or by the
success of Maximus, few were able to preserve their innocence or
their reputation. The liberal gifts of money, lands, and houses, were
insufficient to satiate their rapacious avarice; and the indignation of
the people was justly excited by the remembrance of their abject poverty
and disinterested professions. The penetration of Julian could not
always be deceived: but he was unwilling to despise the characters of
those men whose talents deserved his esteem: he desired to escape the
double reproach of imprudence and inconstancy; and he was apprehensive
of degrading, in the eyes of the profane, the honor of letters and of
religion.

</p>
<p>
The favor of Julian was almost equally divided between the Pagans,
who had firmly adhered to the worship of their ancestors, and the
Christians, who prudently embraced the religion of their sovereign. The
acquisition of new proselytes <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> gratified the ruling passions of his
soul, superstition and vanity; and he was heard to declare, with the
enthusiasm of a missionary, that if he could render each individual
richer than Midas, and every city greater than Babylon, he should not
esteem himself the benefactor of mankind, unless, at the same time,
he could reclaim his subjects from their impious revolt against the
immortal gods. <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> A prince who had studied human nature, and who
possessed the treasures of the Roman empire, could adapt his arguments,
his promises, and his rewards, to every order of Christians; <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> and
the merit of a seasonable conversion was allowed to supply the defects
of a candidate, or even to expiate the guilt of a criminal. As the army
is the most forcible engine of absolute power, Julian applied himself,
with peculiar diligence, to corrupt the religion of his troops,
without whose hearty concurrence every measure must be dangerous and
unsuccessful; and the natural temper of soldiers made this conquest as
easy as it was important. The legions of Gaul devoted themselves to the
faith, as well as to the fortunes, of their victorious leader; and even
before the death of Constantius, he had the satisfaction of announcing
to his friends, that they assisted with fervent devotion, and voracious
appetite, at the sacrifices, which were repeatedly offered in his camp,
of whole hecatombs of fat oxen. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> The armies of the East, which
had been trained under the standard of the cross, and of Constantius,
required a more artful and expensive mode of persuasion. On the days
of solemn and public festivals, the emperor received the homage, and
rewarded the merit, of the troops. His throne of state was encircled
with the military ensigns of Rome and the republic; the holy name of
Christ was erased from the Labarum; and the symbols of war, of majesty,
and of pagan superstition, were so dexterously blended, that the
faithful subject incurred the guilt of idolatry, when he respectfully
saluted the person or image of his sovereign. The soldiers passed
successively in review; and each of them, before he received from
the hand of Julian a liberal donative, proportioned to his rank and
services, was required to cast a few grains of incense into the flame
which burnt upon the altar. Some Christian confessors might resist, and
others might repent; but the far greater number, allured by the prospect
of gold, and awed by the presence of the emperor, contracted the
criminal engagement; and their future perseverance in the worship of the
gods was enforced by every consideration of duty and of interest.
</p>
<p>
By the frequent repetition of these arts, and at the expense of sums
which would have purchased the service of half the nations of Scythia,
Julian gradually acquired for his troops the imaginary protection of
the gods, and for himself the firm and effectual support of the Roman
legions. <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> It is indeed more than probable, that the restoration and
encouragement of Paganism revealed a multitude of pretended Christians,
who, from motives of temporal advantage, had acquiesced in the religion
of the former reign; and who afterwards returned, with the same
flexibility of conscience, to the faith which was professed by the
successors of Julian.

While the devout monarch incessantly labored to restore and propagate
the religion of his ancestors, he embraced the extraordinary design
of rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem. In a public epistle <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> to the
nation or community of the Jews, dispersed through the provinces, he
pities their misfortunes, condemns their oppressors, praises their
constancy, declares himself their gracious protector, and expresses
a pious hope, that after his return from the Persian war, he may be
permitted to pay his grateful vows to the Almighty in his holy city
of Jerusalem. The blind superstition, and abject slavery, of those
unfortunate exiles, must excite the contempt of a philosophic emperor;
but they deserved the friendship of Julian, by their implacable hatred
of the Christian name. The barren synagogue abhorred and envied the
fecundity of the rebellious church; the power of the Jews was not equal
to their malice; but their gravest rabbis approved the private murder
of an apostate; <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> and their seditious clamors had often awakened the
indolence of the Pagan magistrates. Under the reign of Constantine,
the Jews became the subjects of their revolted children nor was it long
before they experienced the bitterness of domestic tyranny. The civil
immunities which had been granted, or confirmed, by Severus, were
gradually repealed by the Christian princes; and a rash tumult, excited
by the Jews of Palestine, <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> seemed to justify the lucrative modes of
oppression which were invented by the bishops and eunuchs of the
court of Constantius. The Jewish patriarch, who was still permitted to
exercise a precarious jurisdiction, held his residence at Tiberias; <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a>
and the neighboring cities of Palestine were filled with the remains
of a people who fondly adhered to the promised land. But the edict of
Hadrian was renewed and enforced; and they viewed from afar the walls of
the holy city, which were profaned in their eyes by the triumph of the
cross and the devotion of the Christians. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a>

In the midst of a rocky and barren country, the walls of Jerusalem <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a>
enclosed the two mountains of Sion and Acra, within an oval figure of
about three English miles. <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> Towards the south, the upper town, and
the fortress of David, were erected on the lofty ascent of Mount Sion:
on the north side, the buildings of the lower town covered the spacious
summit of Mount Acra; and a part of the hill, distinguished by the name
of Moriah, and levelled by human industry, was crowned with the stately
temple of the Jewish nation. After the final destruction of the temple
by the arms of Titus and Hadrian, a ploughshare was drawn over the
consecrated ground, as a sign of perpetual interdiction. Sion was
deserted; and the vacant space of the lower city was filled with
the public and private edifices of the Aelian colony, which spread
themselves over the adjacent hill of Calvary. The holy places were
polluted with mountains of idolatry; and, either from design or
accident, a chapel was dedicated to Venus, on the spot which had been
sanctified by the death and resurrection of Christ. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> <a href="#note-6111" name="noteref-6111"><small>6111</small></a> Almost
three hundred years after those stupendous events, the profane chapel of
Venus was demolished by the order of Constantine; and the removal of the
earth and stones revealed the holy sepulchre to the eyes of mankind.
A magnificent church was erected on that mystic ground, by the first
Christian emperor; and the effects of his pious munificence were
extended to every spot which had been consecrated by the footstep of
patriarchs, of prophets, and of the Son of God. <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a>

The passionate desire of contemplating the original monuments of their
redemption attracted to Jerusalem a successive crowd of pilgrims, from
the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, and the most distant countries of the
East; <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> and their piety was authorized by the example of the empress
Helena, who appears to have united the credulity of age with the warm
feelings of a recent conversion. Sages and heroes, who have visited
the memorable scenes of ancient wisdom or glory, have confessed the
inspiration of the genius of the place; <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> and the Christian who knelt
before the holy sepulchre, ascribed his lively faith, and his fervent
devotion, to the more immediate influence of the Divine Spirit. The
zeal, perhaps the avarice, of the clergy of Jerusalem, cherished and
multiplied these beneficial visits. They fixed, by unquestionable
tradition, the scene of each memorable event. They exhibited the
instruments which had been used in the passion of Christ; the nails and
the lance that had pierced his hands, his feet, and his side; the crown
of thorns that was planted on his head; the pillar at which he was
scourged; and, above all, they showed the cross on which he suffered,
and which was dug out of the earth in the reign of those princes, who
inserted the symbol of Christianity in the banners of the Roman legions.
<a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> Such miracles as seemed necessary to account for its extraordinary
preservation, and seasonable discovery, were gradually propagated
without opposition. The custody of the true cross, which on Easter
Sunday was solemnly exposed to the people, was intrusted to the bishop
of Jerusalem; and he alone might gratify the curious devotion of the
pilgrims, by the gift of small pieces, which they encased in gold or
gems, and carried away in triumph to their respective countries. But as
this gainful branch of commerce must soon have been annihilated, it was
found convenient to suppose, that the marvelous wood possessed a
secret power of vegetation; and that its substance, though continually
diminished, still remained entire and unimpaired. <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> It might perhaps
have been expected, that the influence of the place and the belief of
a perpetual miracle, should have produced some salutary effects on the
morals, as well as on the faith, of the people. Yet the most respectable
of the ecclesiastical writers have been obliged to confess, not only
that the streets of Jerusalem were filled with the incessant tumult of
business and pleasure, <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> but that every species of vice&mdash;adultery,
theft, idolatry, poisoning, murder&mdash;was familiar to the inhabitants
of the holy city. <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> The wealth and preeminence of the church

The vain and ambitious mind of Julian might aspire to restore the
ancient glory of the temple of Jerusalem. <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> As the Christians were
firmly persuaded that a sentence of everlasting destruction had been
pronounced against the whole fabric of the Mosaic law, the Imperial
sophist would have converted the success of his undertaking into a
specious argument against the faith of prophecy, and the truth of
revelation. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> He was displeased with the spiritual worship of the
synagogue; but he approved the institutions of Moses, who had not
disdained to adopt many of the rites and ceremonies of Egypt. <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a>
The local and national deity of the Jews was sincerely adored by a
polytheist, who desired only to multiply the number of the gods; <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a>
and such was the appetite of Julian for bloody sacrifice, that his
emulation might be excited by the piety of Solomon, who had offered, at
the feast of the dedication, twenty-two thousand oxen, and one hundred
and twenty thousand sheep. <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> These considerations might influence his
designs; but the prospect of an immediate and important advantage would
not suffer the impatient monarch to expect the remote and uncertain
event of the Persian war. He resolved to erect, without delay, on the
commanding eminence of Moriah, a stately temple, which might eclipse
the splendor of the church of the resurrection on the adjacent hill of
Calvary; to establish an order of priests, whose interested zeal would
detect the arts, and resist the ambition, of their Christian rivals;
and to invite a numerous colony of Jews, whose stern fanaticism would be
always prepared to second, and even to anticipate, the hostile measures
of the Pagan government. Among the friends of the emperor (if the names
of emperor, and of friend, are not incompatible) the first place was
assigned, by Julian himself, to the virtuous and learned Alypius.
<a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> The humanity of Alypius was tempered by severe justice and
manly fortitude; and while he exercised his abilities in the civil
administration of Britain, he imitated, in his poetical compositions,
the harmony and softness of the odes of Sappho. This minister, to whom
Julian communicated, without reserve, his most careless levities, and
his most serious counsels, received an extraordinary commission to
restore, in its pristine beauty, the temple of Jerusalem; and the
diligence of Alypius required and obtained the strenuous support of the
governor of Palestine. At the call of their great deliverer, the Jews,
from all the provinces of the empire, assembled on the holy mountain of
their fathers; and their insolent triumph alarmed and exasperated the
Christian inhabitants of Jerusalem. The desire of rebuilding the temple
has in every age been the ruling passion of the children of Israel. In
this propitious moment the men forgot their avarice, and the women their
delicacy; spades and pickaxes of silver were provided by the vanity of
the rich, and the rubbish was transported in mantles of silk and purple.
Every purse was opened in liberal contributions, every hand claimed
a share in the pious labor, and the commands of a great monarch were
executed by the enthusiasm of a whole people. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a>

Yet, on this occasion, the joint efforts of power and enthusiasm were
unsuccessful; and the ground of the Jewish temple, which is now covered
by a Mahometan mosque, <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> still continued to exhibit the same edifying
spectacle of ruin and desolation. Perhaps the absence and death of the
emperor, and the new maxims of a Christian reign, might explain the
interruption of an arduous work, which was attempted only in the last
six months of the life of Julian. <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> But the Christians entertained
a natural and pious expectation, that, in this memorable contest,
the honor of religion would be vindicated by some signal miracle. An
earthquake, a whirlwind, and a fiery eruption, which overturned and
scattered the new foundations of the temple, are attested, with some
variations, by contemporary and respectable evidence. <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> This public
event is described by Ambrose, <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> bishop of Milan, in an epistle to

of the Jews; by the eloquent Chrysostom, <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> who might appeal to the
memory of the elder part of his congregation at Antioch; and by Gregory
Nazianzen, <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a> who published his account of the miracle before the
expiration of the same year. The last of these writers has boldly
declared, that this preternatural event was not disputed by the
infidels; and his assertion, strange as it may seem is confirmed by the
unexceptionable testimony of Ammianus Marcellinus. <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> The philosophic
soldier, who loved the virtues, without adopting the prejudices, of his
master, has recorded, in his judicious and candid history of his own
times, the extraordinary obstacles which interrupted the restoration of
the temple of Jerusalem. "Whilst Alypius, assisted by the governor of
the province, urged, with vigor and diligence, the execution of the
work, horrible balls of fire breaking out near the foundations, with
frequent and reiterated attacks, rendered the place, from time to time,
inaccessible to the scorched and blasted workmen; and the victorious
element continuing in this manner obstinately and resolutely bent, as it
were, to drive them to a distance, the undertaking was abandoned."
<a href="#note-8311" name="noteref-8311"><small>8311</small></a> Such authority should satisfy a believing, and must astonish an
incredulous, mind. Yet a philosopher may still require the original
evidence of impartial and intelligent spectators. At this important
crisis, any singular accident of nature would assume the appearance, and
produce the effects of a real prodigy. This glorious deliverance would
be speedily improved and magnified by the pious art of the clergy of
Jerusalem, and the active credulity of the Christian world and, at the
distance of twenty years, a Roman historian, care less of theological
disputes, might adorn his work with the specious and splendid miracle.

[ Michaelis has given an ingenious and sufficiently
probable explanation of this remarkable incident, which the positive
testimony of Ammianus, a contemporary and a pagan, will not permit us
to call in question. It was suggested by a passage in Tacitus. That
historian, speaking of Jerusalem, says, [I omit the first part of the
quotation adduced by M. Guizot, which only by a most extraordinary
mistranslation of muri introrsus sinuati by "enfoncemens" could be made
to bear on the question.&mdash;M.] The Temple itself was a kind of citadel,
which had its own walls, superior in their workmanship and construction
to those of the city. The porticos themselves, which surrounded the
temple, were an excellent fortification. There was a fountain of
constantly running water; subterranean excavations under the mountain;
reservoirs and cisterns to collect the rain-water. Tac. Hist. v. ii.
12. These excavations and reservoirs must have been very considerable.
The latter furnished water during the whole siege of Jerusalem to
1,100,000 inhabitants, for whom the fountain of Siloe could not have
sufficed, and who had no fresh rain-water, the siege having taken place
from the month of April to the month of August, a period of the year
during which it rarely rains in Jerusalem. As to the excavations, they
served after, and even before, the return of the Jews from Babylon,
to contain not only magazines of oil, wine, and corn, but also the
treasures which were laid up in the Temple. Josephus has related several
incidents which show their extent. When Jerusalem was on the point of
being taken by Titus, the rebel chiefs, placing their last hopes
in these vast subterranean cavities, formed a design of concealing
themselves there, and remaining during the conflagration of the city,
and until the Romans had retired to a distance. The greater part had not
time to execute their design; but one of them, Simon, the Son of Gioras,
having provided himself with food, and tools to excavate the earth
descended into this retreat with some companions: he remained there till
Titus had set out for Rome: under the pressure of famine he issued forth
on a sudden in the very place where the Temple had stood, and appeared
in the midst of the Roman guard. He was seized and carried to Rome for
the triumph. His appearance made it be suspected that other Jews
might have chosen the same asylum; search was made, and a great number
discovered. Joseph. de Bell. Jud. l. vii. c. 2. It is probable that
the greater part of these excavations were the remains of the time of
Solomon, when it was the custom to work to a great extent under ground:
no other date can be assigned to them. The Jews, on their return from
the captivity, were too poor to undertake such works; and, although
Herod, on rebuilding the Temple, made some excavations, (Joseph. Ant.
Jud. xv. 11, vii.,) the haste with which that building was completed
will not allow us to suppose that they belonged to that period. Some
were used for sewers and drains, others served to conceal the immense
treasures of which Crassus, a hundred and twenty years before, plundered
the Jews, and which doubtless had been since replaced. The Temple was
destroyed A. C. 70; the attempt of Julian to rebuild it, and the fact
related by Ammianus, coincide with the year 363. There had then elapsed
between these two epochs an interval of near 300 years, during which the
excavations, choked up with ruins, must have become full of inflammable
air. The workmen employed by Julian as they were digging, arrived at
the excavations of the Temple; they would take torches to explore them;
sudden flames repelled those who approached; explosions were heard, and
these phenomena were renewed every time that they penetrated into new
subterranean passages. This explanation is confirmed by the relation
of an event nearly similar, by Josephus. King Herod having heard that
immense treasures had been concealed in the sepulchre of David, he
descended into it with a few confidential persons; he found in the first
subterranean chamber only jewels and precious stuffs: but having wished
to penetrate into a second chamber, which had been long closed, he
was repelled, when he opened it, by flames which killed those who
accompanied him. (Ant. Jud. xvi. 7, i.) As here there is no room for
miracle, this fact may be considered as a new proof of the veracity of
that related by Ammianus and the contemporary writers.&mdash;G. &mdash;&mdash;To the
illustrations of the extent of the subterranean chambers adduced by
Michaelis, may be added, that when John of Gischala, during the siege,
surprised the Temple, the party of Eleazar took refuge within them.
Bell. Jud. vi. 3, i. The sudden sinking of the hill of Sion when
Jerusalem was occupied by Barchocab, may have been connected with
similar excavations. Hist. of Jews, vol. iii. 122 and 186.&mdash;M. &mdash;&mdash;It is
a fact now popularly known, that when mines which have been long closed
are opened, one of two things takes place; either the torches are
extinguished and the men fall first into a swoor and soon die; or, if
the air is inflammable, a little flame is seen to flicker round the
lamp, which spreads and multiplies till the conflagration becomes
general, is followed by an explosion, and kill all who are in the
way.&mdash;G.]

<h2>
    Chapter XXIII: Reign Of Julian.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
The restoration of the Jewish temple was secretly connected with the
ruin of the Christian church. Julian still continued to maintain the
freedom of religious worship, without distinguishing whether this
universal toleration proceeded from his justice or his clemency. He
affected to pity the unhappy Christians, who were mistaken in the most
important object of their lives; but his pity was degraded by contempt,
his contempt was embittered by hatred; and the sentiments of Julian were
expressed in a style of sarcastic wit, which inflicts a deep and deadly
wound, whenever it issues from the mouth of a sovereign. As he was
sensible that the Christians gloried in the name of their Redeemer,
he countenanced, and perhaps enjoined, the use of the less honorable
appellation of Galilaeans. <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> He declared, that by the folly of the
Galilaeans, whom he describes as a sect of fanatics, contemptible to
men, and odious to the gods, the empire had been reduced to the brink of
destruction; and he insinuates in a public edict, that a frantic patient
might sometimes be cured by salutary violence. <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> An ungenerous
distinction was admitted into the mind and counsels of Julian, that,
according to the difference of their religious sentiments, one part
of his subjects deserved his favor and friendship, while the other was
entitled only to the common benefits that his justice could not refuse
to an obedient people. According to a principle, pregnant with mischief
and oppression, the emperor transferred to the pontiffs of his own
religion the management of the liberal allowances for the public
revenue, which had been granted to the church by the piety of
Constantine and his sons. The proud system of clerical honors and
immunities, which had been constructed with so much art and labor,
was levelled to the ground; the hopes of testamentary donations were
intercepted by the rigor of the laws; and the priests of the Christian
sect were confounded with the last and most ignominious class of the
people. Such of these regulations as appeared necessary to check the
ambition and avarice of the ecclesiastics, were soon afterwards imitated
by the wisdom of an orthodox prince. The peculiar distinctions which
policy has bestowed, or superstition has lavished, on the sacerdotal
order, must be confined to those priests who profess the religion of the
state. But the will of the legislator was not exempt from prejudice and
passion; and it was the object of the insidious policy of Julian, to
deprive the Christians of all the temporal honors and advantages which
rendered them respectable in the eyes of the world. <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a>

<p>
A just and severe censure has been inflicted on the law which prohibited
the Christians from teaching the arts of grammar and rhetoric. <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> The
motives alleged by the emperor to justify this partial and oppressive
measure, might command, during his lifetime, the silence of slaves and
the applause of Gatterers. Julian abuses the ambiguous meaning of a word
which might be indifferently applied to the language and the religion of
the Greeks: he contemptuously observes, that the men who exalt the
merit of implicit faith are unfit to claim or to enjoy the advantages of
science; and he vainly contends, that if they refuse to adore the
gods of Homer and Demosthenes, they ought to content themselves with
expounding Luke and Matthew in the church of the Galilaeans. <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a> In all
the cities of the Roman world, the education of the youth was intrusted
to masters of grammar and rhetoric; who were elected by the magistrates,
maintained at the public expense, and distinguished by many lucrative
and honorable privileges. The edict of Julian appears to have included
the physicians, and professors of all the liberal arts; and the
emperor, who reserved to himself the approbation of the candidates, was
authorized by the laws to corrupt, or to punish, the religious constancy
of the most learned of the Christians. <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a> As soon as the resignation
of the more obstinate <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> teachers had established the unrivalled
dominion of the Pagan sophists, Julian invited the rising generation to
resort with freedom to the public schools, in a just confidence, that
their tender minds would receive the impressions of literature and
idolatry. If the greatest part of the Christian youth should be deterred
by their own scruples, or by those of their parents, from accepting this
dangerous mode of instruction, they must, at the same time, relinquish
the benefits of a liberal education. Julian had reason to expect that,
in the space of a few years, the church would relapse into its primaeval
simplicity, and that the theologians, who possessed an adequate share
of the learning and eloquence of the age, would be succeeded by a
generation of blind and ignorant fanatics, incapable of defending the
truth of their own principles, or of exposing the various follies of
Polytheism. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a>

It was undoubtedly the wish and design of Julian to deprive the
Christians of the advantages of wealth, of knowledge, and of power; but
the injustice of excluding them from all offices of trust and profit
seems to have been the result of his general policy, rather than the
immediate consequence of any positive law. <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> Superior merit might
deserve and obtain, some extraordinary exceptions; but the greater part
of the Christian officers were gradually removed from their employments

maliciously reminded them, that it was unlawful for a Christian to use

government were intrusted to the pagans, who professed an ardent zeal
for the religion of their ancestors; and as the choice of the emperor
was often directed by the rules of divination, the favorites whom he
preferred as the most agreeable to the gods, did not always obtain the
approbation of mankind. <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> Under the administration of their enemies,
the Christians had much to suffer, and more to apprehend. The temper of
Julian was averse to cruelty; and the care of his reputation, which was
exposed to the eyes of the universe, restrained the philosophic monarch
from violating the laws of justice and toleration, which he himself had
so recently established. But the provincial ministers of his authority
were placed in a less conspicuous station. In the exercise of arbitrary
power, they consulted the wishes, rather than the commands, of their
sovereign; and ventured to exercise a secret and vexatious tyranny
against the sectaries, on whom they were not permitted to confer the
honors of martyrdom. The emperor, who dissembled as long as possible his
knowledge of the injustice that was exercised in his name, expressed
his real sense of the conduct of his officers, by gentle reproofs and
substantial rewards. <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The most effectual instrument of oppression, with which they were
armed, was the law that obliged the Christians to make full and
ample satisfaction for the temples which they had destroyed under
the preceding reign. The zeal of the triumphant church had not always
expected the sanction of the public authority; and the bishops, who were
secure of impunity, had often marched at the head of their congregation,
to attack and demolish the fortresses of the prince of darkness. The
consecrated lands, which had increased the patrimony of the sovereign or
of the clergy, were clearly defined, and easily restored. But on these
lands, and on the ruins of Pagan superstition, the Christians had
frequently erected their own religious edifices: and as it was necessary
to remove the church before the temple could be rebuilt, the justice
and piety of the emperor were applauded by one party, while the other
deplored and execrated his sacrilegious violence. <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> After the ground
was cleared, the restitution of those stately structures which had been
levelled with the dust, and of the precious ornaments which had been
converted to Christian uses, swelled into a very large account of
damages and debt. The authors of the injury had neither the ability nor
the inclination to discharge this accumulated demand: and the impartial
wisdom of a legislator would have been displayed in balancing
the adverse claims and complaints, by an equitable and temperate
arbitration.
</p>
<p>
But the whole empire, and particularly the East, was thrown into
confusion by the rash edicts of Julian; and the Pagan magistrates,
inflamed by zeal and revenge, abused the rigorous privilege of the Roman
law, which substitutes, in the place of his inadequate property, the
person of the insolvent debtor. Under the preceding reign, Mark, bishop
of Arethusa, <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> had labored in the conversion of his people with arms
more effectual than those of persuasion. <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> The magistrates required
the full value of a temple which had been destroyed by his intolerant
zeal: but as they were satisfied of his poverty, they desired only to
bend his inflexible spirit to the promise of the slightest compensation.
They apprehended the aged prelate, they inhumanly scourged him, they
tore his beard; and his naked body, annointed with honey, was suspended,
in a net, between heaven and earth, and exposed to the stings of insects
and the rays of a Syrian sun. <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> From this lofty station, Mark still
persisted to glory in his crime, and to insult the impotent rage of his
persecutors. He was at length rescued from their hands, and dismissed to
enjoy the honor of his divine triumph. The Arians celebrated the
virtue of their pious confessor; the Catholics ambitiously claimed his
alliance; <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> and the Pagans, who might be susceptible of shame or
remorse, were deterred from the repetition of such unavailing cruelty.
<a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> Julian spared his life: but if the bishop of Arethusa had saved
the infancy of Julian, <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> posterity will condemn the ingratitude,
instead of praising the clemency, of the emperor.

At the distance of five miles from Antioch, the Macedonian kings of
Syria had consecrated to Apollo one of the most elegant places of
devotion in the Pagan world. <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> A magnificent temple rose in honor
of the god of light; and his colossal figure <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> almost filled the
capacious sanctuary, which was enriched with gold and gems, and adorned
by the skill of the Grecian artists. The deity was represented in a
bending attitude, with a golden cup in his hand, pouring out a libation
on the earth; as if he supplicated the venerable mother to give to
his arms the cold and beauteous Daphne: for the spot was ennobled by
fiction; and the fancy of the Syrian poets had transported the amorous
tale from the banks of the Peneus to those of the Orontes. The ancient
rites of Greece were imitated by the royal colony of Antioch. A stream
of prophecy, which rivalled the truth and reputation of the Delphic
oracle, flowed from the Castalian fountain of Daphne. <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> In the
adjacent fields a stadium was built by a special privilege, <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a> which
had been purchased from Elis; the Olympic games were celebrated at the
expense of the city; and a revenue of thirty thousand pounds sterling
was annually applied to the public pleasures. <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> The perpetual resort
of pilgrims and spectators insensibly formed, in the neighborhood of the
temple, the stately and populous village of Daphne, which emulated the
splendor, without acquiring the title, of a provincial city. The temple
and the village were deeply bosomed in a thick grove of laurels and
cypresses, which reached as far as a circumference of ten miles, and
formed in the most sultry summers a cool and impenetrable shade. A
thousand streams of the purest water, issuing from every hill, preserved
the verdure of the earth, and the temperature of the air; the senses
were gratified with harmonious sounds and aromatic odors; and the
peaceful grove was consecrated to health and joy, to luxury and love.
The vigorous youth pursued, like Apollo, the object of his desires; and
the blushing maid was warned, by the fate of Daphne, to shun the folly
of unseasonable coyness. The soldier and the philosopher wisely avoided
the temptation of this sensual paradise: <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> where pleasure, assuming
the character of religion, imperceptibly dissolved the firmness of manly
virtue. But the groves of Daphne continued for many ages to enjoy the
veneration of natives and strangers; the privileges of the holy ground
were enlarged by the munificence of succeeding emperors; and every
generation added new ornaments to the splendor of the temple. <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a>

When Julian, on the day of the annual festival, hastened to adore
the Apollo of Daphne, his devotion was raised to the highest pitch
of eagerness and impatience. His lively imagination anticipated the
grateful pomp of victims, of libations and of incense; a long procession
of youths and virgins, clothed in white robes, the symbol of their
innocence; and the tumultuous concourse of an innumerable people. But
the zeal of Antioch was diverted, since the reign of Christianity, into
a different channel. Instead of hecatombs of fat oxen sacrificed by the
tribes of a wealthy city to their tutelar deity the emperor complains
that he found only a single goose, provided at the expense of a priest,
the pale and solitary in habitant of this decayed temple. <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a> The
altar was deserted, the oracle had been reduced to silence, and the holy
ground was profaned by the introduction of Christian and funereal rites.
After Babylas <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> (a bishop of Antioch, who died in prison in the
persecution of Decius) had rested near a century in his grave, his body,
by the order of Caesar Gallus, was transported into the midst of the
grove of Daphne. A magnificent church was erected over his remains;
a portion of the sacred lands was usurped for the maintenance of the
clergy, and for the burial of the Christians at Antioch, who were
ambitious of lying at the feet of their bishop; and the priests of
Apollo retired, with their affrighted and indignant votaries. As soon as
another revolution seemed to restore the fortune of Paganism, the church
of St. Babylas was demolished, and new buildings were added to the
mouldering edifice which had been raised by the piety of Syrian kings.
But the first and most serious care of Julian was to deliver his
oppressed deity from the odious presence of the dead and living
Christians, who had so effectually suppressed the voice of fraud or
enthusiasm. <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> The scene of infection was purified, according to
the forms of ancient rituals; the bodies were decently removed; and
the ministers of the church were permitted to convey the remains of
St. Babylas to their former habitation within the walls of Antioch.
The modest behavior which might have assuaged the jealousy of a
hostile government was neglected, on this occasion, by the zeal of the
Christians. The lofty car, that transported the relics of Babylas, was
followed, and accompanied, and received, by an innumerable multitude;
who chanted, with thundering acclamations, the Psalms of David the most
expressive of their contempt for idols and idolaters. The return of the
saint was a triumph; and the triumph was an insult on the religion of
the emperor, who exerted his pride to dissemble his resentment. During
the night which terminated this indiscreet procession, the temple of
Daphne was in flames; the statue of Apollo was consumed; and the
walls of the edifice were left a naked and awful monument of ruin. The
Christians of Antioch asserted, with religious confidence, that the
powerful intercession of St. Babylas had pointed the lightnings of
heaven against the devoted roof: but as Julian was reduced to the
alternative of believing either a crime or a miracle, he chose, without
hesitation, without evidence, but with some color of probability, to
impute the fire of Daphne to the revenge of the Galilaeans. <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> Their
offence, had it been sufficiently proved, might have justified the
retaliation, which was immediately executed by the order of Julian, of
shutting the doors, and confiscating the wealth, of the cathedral of
Antioch. To discover the criminals who were guilty of the tumult, of
the fire, or of secreting the riches of the church, several of the
ecclesiastics were tortured; <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> and a Presbyter, of the name of
Theodoret, was beheaded by the sentence of the Count of the East. But
this hasty act was blamed by the emperor; who lamented, with real or
affected concern, that the imprudent zeal of his ministers would tarnish
his reign with the disgrace of persecution. <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a>

    Chapter XXIII: Reign Of Julian.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>
<p>
The zeal of the ministers of Julian was instantly checked by the frown
of their sovereign; but when the father of his country declares himself
the leader of a faction, the license of popular fury cannot easily be
restrained, nor consistently punished. Julian, in a public composition,
applauds the devotion and loyalty of the holy cities of Syria, whose
pious inhabitants had destroyed, at the first signal, the sepulchres
of the Galilaeans; and faintly complains, that they had revenged
the injuries of the gods with less moderation than he should have
recommended. <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> This imperfect and reluctant confession may appear
to confirm the ecclesiastical narratives; that in the cities of Gaza,
Ascalon, Caesarea, Heliopolis, &amp;c., the Pagans abused, without prudence
or remorse, the moment of their prosperity. That the unhappy objects
of their cruelty were released from torture only by death; and as their
mangled bodies were dragged through the streets, they were pierced
(such was the universal rage) by the spits of cooks, and the distaffs of
enraged women; and that the entrails of Christian priests and virgins,
after they had been tasted by those bloody fanatics, were mixed with
barley, and contemptuously thrown to the unclean animals of the city.
<a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a> Such scenes of religious madness exhibit the most contemptible and
odious picture of human nature; but the massacre of Alexandria attracts
still more attention, from the certainty of the fact, the rank of the
victims, and the splendor of the capital of Egypt.

George, <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a> from his parents or his education, surnamed the
Cappadocian, was born at Epiphania in Cilicia, in a fuller's shop. From
this obscure and servile origin he raised himself by the talents of a
parasite; and the patrons, whom he assiduously flattered, procured for
their worthless dependent a lucrative commission, or contract, to supply
the army with bacon. His employment was mean; he rendered it infamous.
He accumulated wealth by the basest arts of fraud and corruption; but
his malversations were so notorious, that George was compelled to escape
from the pursuits of justice. After this disgrace, in which he appears
to have saved his fortune at the expense of his honor, he embraced, with
real or affected zeal, the profession of Arianism. From the love, or
the ostentation, of learning, he collected a valuable library of
history rhetoric, philosophy, and theology, <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> and the choice of
the prevailing faction promoted George of Cappadocia to the throne of
Athanasius. The entrance of the new archbishop was that of a Barbarian
conqueror; and each moment of his reign was polluted by cruelty and
avarice. The Catholics of Alexandria and Egypt were abandoned to a
tyrant, qualified, by nature and education, to exercise the office
of persecution; but he oppressed with an impartial hand the various
inhabitants of his extensive diocese. The primate of Egypt assumed the
pomp and insolence of his lofty station; but he still betrayed the vices
of his base and servile extraction. The merchants of Alexandria were
impoverished by the unjust, and almost universal, monopoly, which he
acquired, of nitre, salt, paper, funerals, &amp;c.: and the spiritual father
of a great people condescended to practise the vile and pernicious arts
of an informer. The Alexandrians could never forget, nor forgive,
the tax, which he suggested, on all the houses of the city; under an
obsolete claim, that the royal founder had conveyed to his successors,
the Ptolemies and the Caesars, the perpetual property of the soil. The
Pagans, who had been flattered with the hopes of freedom and toleration,
excited his devout avarice; and the rich temples of Alexandria were
either pillaged or insulted by the haughty prince, who exclaimed, in a
loud and threatening tone, "How long will these sepulchres be permitted
to stand?" Under the reign of Constantius, he was expelled by the
fury, or rather by the justice, of the people; and it was not without a
violent struggle, that the civil and military powers of the state
could restore his authority, and gratify his revenge. The messenger who
proclaimed at Alexandria the accession of Julian, announced the downfall
of the archbishop. George, with two of his obsequious ministers, Count
Diodorus, and Dracontius, master of the mint were ignominiously dragged
in chains to the public prison. At the end of twenty-four days, the
prison was forced open by the rage of a superstitious multitude,
impatient of the tedious forms of judicial proceedings. The enemies of
gods and men expired under their cruel insults; the lifeless bodies of
the archbishop and his associates were carried in triumph through
the streets on the back of a camel; <a href="#note-12011" name="noteref-12011"><small>12011</small></a> and the inactivity of the
Athanasian party <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a> was esteemed a shining example of evangelical

sea; and the popular leaders of the tumult declared their resolution to
disappoint the devotion of the Christians, and to intercept the future
honors of these martyrs, who had been punished, like their predecessors,
by the enemies of their religion. <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> The fears of the Pagans were

About the same time that Julian was informed of the tumult of
Alexandria, he received intelligence from Edessa, that the proud
and wealthy faction of the Arians had insulted the weakness of the
Valentinians, and committed such disorders as ought not to be suffered
with impunity in a well-regulated state. Without expecting the slow
forms of justice, the exasperated prince directed his mandate to the
magistrates of Edessa, <a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a> by which he confiscated the whole property
of the church: the money was distributed among the soldiers; the lands
were added to the domain; and this act of oppression was aggravated
by the most ungenerous irony. "I show myself," says Julian, "the true
friend of the Galilaeans. Their admirable law has promised the kingdom
of heaven to the poor; and they will advance with more diligence in the
paths of virtue and salvation, when they are relieved by my assistance
from the load of temporal possessions. Take care," pursued the monarch,
in a more serious tone, "take care how you provoke my patience and
humanity. If these disorders continue, I will revenge on the magistrates
the crimes of the people; and you will have reason to dread, not
only confiscation and exile, but fire and the sword." The tumults of
Alexandria were doubtless of a more bloody and dangerous nature: but a
Christian bishop had fallen by the hands of the Pagans; and the public
epistle of Julian affords a very lively proof of the partial spirit of
his administration. His reproaches to the citizens of Alexandria are
mingled with expressions of esteem and tenderness; and he laments, that,
on this occasion, they should have departed from the gentle and generous
manners which attested their Grecian extraction. He gravely censures
the offence which they had committed against the laws of justice
and humanity; but he recapitulates, with visible complacency, the
intolerable provocations which they had so long endured from the impious
tyranny of George of Cappadocia. Julian admits the principle, that
a wise and vigorous government should chastise the insolence of the
people; yet, in consideration of their founder Alexander, and of Serapis
their tutelar deity, he grants a free and gracious pardon to the guilty
city, for which he again feels the affection of a brother. <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a>

After the tumult of Alexandria had subsided, Athanasius, amidst the
public acclamations, seated himself on the throne from whence his
unworthy competitor had been precipitated: and as the zeal of the
archbishop was tempered with discretion, the exercise of his authority
tended not to inflame, but to reconcile, the minds of the people. His
pastoral labors were not confined to the narrow limits of Egypt. The
state of the Christian world was present to his active and capacious
mind; and the age, the merit, the reputation of Athanasius, enabled him
to assume, in a moment of danger, the office of Ecclesiastical Dictator.
<a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a> Three years were not yet elapsed since the majority of the bishops
of the West had ignorantly, or reluctantly, subscribed the Confession of
Rimini. They repented, they believed, but they dreaded the unseasonable
rigor of their orthodox brethren; and if their pride was stronger than
their faith, they might throw themselves into the arms of the Arians, to
escape the indignity of a public penance, which must degrade them to the
condition of obscure laymen. At the same time the domestic differences
concerning the union and distinction of the divine persons, were
agitated with some heat among the Catholic doctors; and the progress of
this metaphysical controversy seemed to threaten a public and lasting
division of the Greek and Latin churches. By the wisdom of a select
synod, to which the name and presence of Athanasius gave the authority
of a general council, the bishops, who had unwarily deviated into error,
were admitted to the communion of the church, on the easy condition of
subscribing the Nicene Creed; without any formal acknowledgment of their
past fault, or any minute definition of their scholastic opinions. The
advice of the primate of Egypt had already prepared the clergy of Gaul
and Spain, of Italy and Greece, for the reception of this salutary
measure; and, notwithstanding the opposition of some ardent spirits,
<a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> the fear of the common enemy promoted the peace and harmony of the
Christians. <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a>

The skill and diligence of the primate of Egypt had improved the season
of tranquillity, before it was interrupted by the hostile edicts of the
emperor. <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a> Julian, who despised the Christians, honored Athanasius
with his sincere and peculiar hatred. For his sake alone, he introduced
an arbitrary distinction, repugnant at least to the spirit of his former
declarations. He maintained, that the Galilaeans, whom he had recalled
from exile, were not restored, by that general indulgence, to
the possession of their respective churches; and he expressed his
astonishment, that a criminal, who had been repeatedly condemned by the
judgment of the emperors, should dare to insult the majesty of the laws,
and insolently usurp the archiepiscopal throne of Alexandria, without
expecting the orders of his sovereign. As a punishment for the imaginary
offence, he again banished Athanasius from the city; and he was pleased
to suppose, that this act of justice would be highly agreeable to his
pious subjects. The pressing solicitations of the people soon convinced
him, that the majority of the Alexandrians were Christians; and that
the greatest part of the Christians were firmly attached to the cause of
their oppressed primate. But the knowledge of their sentiments, instead
of persuading him to recall his decree, provoked him to extend to all
Egypt the term of the exile of Athanasius. The zeal of the multitude
rendered Julian still more inexorable: he was alarmed by the danger of
leaving at the head of a tumultuous city, a daring and popular leader;
and the language of his resentment discovers the opinion which he
entertained of the courage and abilities of Athanasius. The execution
of the sentence was still delayed, by the caution or negligence of
Ecdicius, praefect of Egypt, who was at length awakened from his
lethargy by a severe reprimand. "Though you neglect," says Julian, "to
write to me on any other subject, at least it is your duty to inform me
of your conduct towards Athanasius, the enemy of the gods. My intentions
have been long since communicated to you. I swear by the great Serapis,
that unless, on the calends of December, Athanasius has departed from
Alexandria, nay, from Egypt, the officers of your government shall pay
a fine of one hundred pounds of gold. You know my temper: I am slow to
condemn, but I am still slower to forgive." This epistle was enforced by
a short postscript, written with the emperor's own hand. "The contempt
that is shown for all the gods fills me with grief and indignation.
There is nothing that I should see, nothing that I should hear, with
more pleasure, than the expulsion of Athanasius from all Egypt. The
abominable wretch! Under my reign, the baptism of several Grecian ladies
of the highest rank has been the effect of his persecutions." <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> The
death of Athanasius was not expressly commanded; but the praefect of
Egypt understood that it was safer for him to exceed, than to neglect,
the orders of an irritated master. The archbishop prudently retired to
the monasteries of the Desert; eluded, with his usual dexterity, the
snares of the enemy; and lived to triumph over the ashes of a prince,
who, in words of formidable import, had declared his wish that the whole
venom of the Galilaean school were contained in the single person of
Athanasius. <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a> <a href="#note-13411" name="noteref-13411"><small>13411</small></a>

<p>
I have endeavored faithfully to represent the artful system by which
Julian proposed to obtain the effects, without incurring the guilt,
or reproach, of persecution. But if the deadly spirit of fanaticism
perverted the heart and understanding of a virtuous prince, it must, at
the same time, be confessed that the real sufferings of the Christians
were inflamed and magnified by human passions and religious enthusiasm.
The meekness and resignation which had distinguished the primitive
disciples of the gospel, was the object of the applause, rather than of
the imitation of their successors. The Christians, who had now possessed
above forty years the civil and ecclesiastical government of the empire,
had contracted the insolent vices of prosperity, <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a> and the habit of
believing that the saints alone were entitled to reign over the earth.
As soon as the enmity of Julian deprived the clergy of the privileges
which had been conferred by the favor of Constantine, they complained
of the most cruel oppression; and the free toleration of idolaters and
heretics was a subject of grief and scandal to the orthodox party.
<a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a> The acts of violence, which were no longer countenanced by
the magistrates, were still committed by the zeal of the people. At
Pessinus, the altar of Cybele was overturned almost in the presence of
the emperor; and in the city of Caesarea in Cappadocia, the temple of
Fortune, the sole place of worship which had been left to the Pagans,
was destroyed by the rage of a popular tumult. On these occasions,
a prince, who felt for the honor of the gods, was not disposed to
interrupt the course of justice; and his mind was still more deeply
exasperated, when he found that the fanatics, who had deserved and
suffered the punishment of incendiaries, were rewarded with the honors
of martyrdom. <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a> The Christian subjects of Julian were assured of the
hostile designs of their sovereign; and, to their jealous apprehension,
every circumstance of his government might afford some grounds of
discontent and suspicion. In the ordinary administration of the
laws, the Christians, who formed so large a part of the people, must
frequently be condemned: but their indulgent brethren, without examining
the merits of the cause, presumed their innocence, allowed their
claims, and imputed the severity of their judge to the partial malice
of religious persecution. <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a> These present hardships, intolerable as
they might appear, were represented as a slight prelude of the impending
calamities. The Christians considered Julian as a cruel and crafty
tyrant; who suspended the execution of his revenge till he should return
victorious from the Persian war. They expected, that as soon as he
had triumphed over the foreign enemies of Rome, he would lay aside the
irksome mask of dissimulation; that the amphitheatre would stream with
the blood of hermits and bishops; and that the Christians who still
persevered in the profession of the faith, would be deprived of the
common benefits of nature and society. <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a> Every calumny <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a> that
could wound the reputation of the Apostate, was credulously embraced by
the fears and hatred of his adversaries; and their indiscreet clamors
provoked the temper of a sovereign, whom it was their duty to respect,
and their interest to flatter.
</p>
<p>
They still protested, that prayers and tears were their only weapons
against the impious tyrant, whose head they devoted to the justice of
offended Heaven. But they insinuated, with sullen resolution, that
their submission was no longer the effect of weakness; and that, in
the imperfect state of human virtue, the patience, which is founded
on principle, may be exhausted by persecution. It is impossible to
determine how far the zeal of Julian would have prevailed over his good
sense and humanity; but if we seriously reflect on the strength and
spirit of the church, we shall be convinced, that before the emperor
could have extinguished the religion of Christ, he must have involved
his country in the horrors of a civil war. <a href="#note-141" name="noteref-141"><small>141</small></a>
