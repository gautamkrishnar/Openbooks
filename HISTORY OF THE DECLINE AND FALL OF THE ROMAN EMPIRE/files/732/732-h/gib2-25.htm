<p>
The death of Julian had left the public affairs of the empire in a
very doubtful and dangerous situation. The Roman army was saved by an
inglorious, perhaps a necessary treaty; <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> and the first moments of
peace were consecrated by the pious Jovian to restore the domestic
tranquility of the church and state. The indiscretion of his
predecessor, instead of reconciling, had artfully fomented the religious
war: and the balance which he affected to preserve between the hostile
factions, served only to perpetuate the contest, by the vicissitudes
of hope and fear, by the rival claims of ancient possession and actual
favor. The Christians had forgotten the spirit of the gospel; and the
Pagans had imbibed the spirit of the church. In private families, the
sentiments of nature were extinguished by the blind fury of zeal and
revenge: the majesty of the laws was violated or abused; the cities of
the East were stained with blood; and the most implacable enemies of the
Romans were in the bosom of their country. Jovian was educated in the
profession of Christianity; and as he marched from Nisibis to Antioch,
the banner of the Cross, the Labarum of Constantine, which was again
displayed at the head of the legions, announced to the people the faith
of their new emperor. As soon as he ascended the throne, he transmitted
a circular epistle to all the governors of provinces; in which he
confessed the divine truth, and secured the legal establishment, of the
Christian religion. The insidious edicts of Julian were abolished;
the ecclesiastical immunities were restored and enlarged; and Jovian
condescended to lament, that the distress of the times obliged him to
diminish the measure of charitable distributions. <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> The Christians
were unanimous in the loud and sincere applause which they bestowed on
the pious successor of Julian. But they were still ignorant what creed,
or what synod, he would choose for the standard of orthodoxy; and the
peace of the church immediately revived those eager disputes which had
been suspended during the season of persecution. The episcopal leaders
of the contending sects, convinced, from experience, how much their fate
would depend on the earliest impressions that were made on the mind of
an untutored soldier, hastened to the court of Edessa, or Antioch.
The highways of the East were crowded with Homoousian, and Arian, and
Semi-Arian, and Eunomian bishops, who struggled to outstrip each other
in the holy race: the apartments of the palace resounded with their
clamors; and the ears of the prince were assaulted, and perhaps
astonished, by the singular mixture of metaphysical argument and
passionate invective. <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> The moderation of Jovian, who recommended
concord and charity, and referred the disputants to the sentence of a
future council, was interpreted as a symptom of indifference: but his
attachment to the Nicene creed was at length discovered and declared,
by the reverence which he expressed for the celestial <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> virtues of
the great Athanasius. The intrepid veteran of the faith, at the age of
seventy, had issued from his retreat on the first intelligence of the
tyrant's death. The acclamations of the people seated him once more on
the archiepiscopal throne; and he wisely accepted, or anticipated,
the invitation of Jovian. The venerable figure of Athanasius, his calm
courage, and insinuating eloquence, sustained the reputation which he
had already acquired in the courts of four successive princes. <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> As
soon as he had gained the confidence, and secured the faith, of the
Christian emperor, he returned in triumph to his diocese, and continued,
with mature counsels and undiminished vigor, to direct, ten years
longer, <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> the ecclesiastical government of Alexandria, Egypt, and the
Catholic church. Before his departure from Antioch, he assured Jovian
that his orthodox devotion would be rewarded with a long and peaceful
reign. Athanasius, had reason to hope, that he should be allowed either
the merit of a successful prediction, or the excuse of a grateful though
ineffectual prayer. <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a>

condemned the rape or marriage of nuns (Cod. Theod. l. ix. tit. xxv.
leg. 2) is exaggerated by Sozomen; who supposes, that an amorous glance,
the adultery of the heart, was punished with death by the evangelic
legislator.]

with the coarse pleasantry of Jovian; but his partiality for Athanasius
assumes, in his eyes, the character of justice.]

date (A. D. 373, May 2) which seems the most consistent with history
and reason, is ratified by his authentic life, (Maffei Osservazioni
Letterarie, tom. iii. p. 81.)]

this indiscreet promise is omitted; perhaps by the Catholics, jealous of
the prophetic fame of their leader.]
</p>
<p>
The slightest force, when it is applied to assist and guide the natural
descent of its object, operates with irresistible weight; and Jovian had
the good fortune to embrace the religious opinions which were supported
by the spirit of the times, and the zeal and numbers of the most
powerful sect. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> Under his reign, Christianity obtained an easy
and lasting victory; and as soon as the smile of royal patronage was
withdrawn, the genius of Paganism, which had been fondly raised and
cherished by the arts of Julian, sunk irrecoverably in the. In many
cities, the temples were shut or deserted: the philosophers who had
abused their transient favor, thought it prudent to shave their beards,
and disguise their profession; and the Christians rejoiced, that they
were now in a condition to forgive, or to revenge, the injuries which
they had suffered under the preceding reign. <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> The consternation
of the Pagan world was dispelled by a wise and gracious edict of
toleration; in which Jovian explicitly declared, that although he should
severely punish the sacrilegious rites of magic, his subjects might
exercise, with freedom and safety, the ceremonies of the ancient
worship. The memory of this law has been preserved by the orator
Themistius, who was deputed by the senate of Constantinople to express
their royal devotion for the new emperor. Themistius expatiates on the
clemency of the Divine Nature, the facility of human error, the
rights of conscience, and the independence of the mind; and, with some
eloquence, inculcates the principles of philosophical toleration; whose
aid Superstition herself, in the hour of her distress, is not ashamed to
implore. He justly observes, that in the recent changes, both religions
had been alternately disgraced by the seeming acquisition of worthless
proselytes, of those votaries of the reigning purple, who could pass,
without a reason, and without a blush, from the church to the temple,
and from the altars of Jupiter to the sacred table of the Christians.

the establishment of the Catholic religion. Each of them turned away
from the object which he disliked, and wished to suppress the part of
the edict the least honorable, in his opinion, to the emperor.]
</p>
<p>
In the space of seven months, the Roman troops, who were now returned to
Antioch, had performed a march of fifteen hundred miles; in which
they had endured all the hardships of war, of famine, and of climate.
Notwithstanding their services, their fatigues, and the approach of
winter, the timid and impatient Jovian allowed only, to the men and
horses, a respite of six weeks. The emperor could not sustain the
indiscreet and malicious raillery of the people of Antioch. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> He was
impatient to possess the palace of Constantinople; and to prevent the
ambition of some competitor, who might occupy the vacant allegiance
of Europe. But he soon received the grateful intelligence, that his
authority was acknowledged from the Thracian Bosphorus to the Atlantic
Ocean. By the first letters which he despatched from the camp of
Mesopotamia, he had delegated the military command of Gaul and Illyricum
to Malarich, a brave and faithful officer of the nation of the
Franks; and to his father-in-law, Count Lucillian, who had formerly
distinguished his courage and conduct in the defence of Nisibis.
Malarich had declined an office to which he thought himself unequal;
and Lucillian was massacred at Rheims, in an accidental mutiny of the
Batavian cohorts. <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> But the moderation of Jovinus, master-general of
the cavalry, who forgave the intention of his disgrace, soon appeased
the tumult, and confirmed the uncertain minds of the soldiers. The oath
of fidelity was administered and taken, with loyal acclamations; and the
deputies of the Western armies <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> saluted their new sovereign as he
descended from Mount Taurus to the city of Tyana in Cappadocia. From
Tyana he continued his hasty march to Ancyra, capital of the province of
Galatia; where Jovian assumed, with his infant son, the name and ensigns
of the consulship. <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> Dadastana, <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> an obscure town, almost at an
equal distance between Ancyra and Nice, was marked for the fatal term of
his journey and life. After indulging himself with a plentiful, perhaps
an intemperate, supper, he retired to rest; and the next morning the
emperor Jovian was found dead in his bed. The cause of this sudden death
was variously understood. By some it was ascribed to the consequences
of an indigestion, occasioned either by the quantity of the wine, or
the quality of the mushrooms, which he had swallowed in the evening.
According to others, he was suffocated in his sleep by the vapor
of charcoal, which extracted from the walls of the apartment the
unwholesome moisture of the fresh plaster. <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> But the want of a
regular inquiry into the death of a prince, whose reign and person
were soon forgotten, appears to have been the only circumstance which
countenanced the malicious whispers of poison and domestic guilt. <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a>
The body of Jovian was sent to Constantinople, to be interred with his
predecessors, and the sad procession was met on the road by his wife
Charito, the daughter of Count Lucillian; who still wept the recent
death of her father, and was hastening to dry her tears in the embraces
of an Imperial husband. Her disappointment and grief were imbittered
by the anxiety of maternal tenderness. Six weeks before the death of
Jovian, his infant son had been placed in the curule chair, adorned
with the title of Nobilissimus, and the vain ensigns of the consulship.
Unconscious of his fortune, the royal youth, who, from his grandfather,
assumed the name of Varronian, was reminded only by the jealousy of the
government, that he was the son of an emperor. Sixteen years afterwards
he was still alive, but he had already been deprived of an eye; and his
afflicted mother expected every hour, that the innocent victim would be
torn from her arms, to appease, with his blood, the suspicions of the
reigning prince. <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a>

illustrious misfortunes; and observes, that of nine emperors (including
the Caesar Gallus) who had reigned in his time, only two (Constantine
and Constantius) died a natural death. Such vague consolations have
never wiped away a single tear.]
</p>
<p>
After the death of Jovian, the throne of the Roman world remained ten
days, <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> without a master. The ministers and generals still continued
to meet in council; to exercise their respective functions; to maintain
the public order; and peaceably to conduct the army to the city of Nice
in Bithynia, which was chosen for the place of the election. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> In
a solemn assembly of the civil and military powers of the empire, the
diadem was again unanimously offered to the praefect Sallust. He enjoyed
the glory of a second refusal: and when the virtues of the father
were alleged in favor of his son, the praefect, with the firmness of a
disinterested patriot, declared to the electors, that the feeble age
of the one, and the unexperienced youth of the other, were equally
incapable of the laborious duties of government. Several candidates were
proposed; and, after weighing the objections of character or situation,
they were successively rejected; but, as soon as the name of Valentinian
was pronounced, the merit of that officer united the suffrages of the
whole assembly, and obtained the sincere approbation of Sallust himself.
Valentinian <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> was the son of Count Gratian, a native of Cibalis, in
Pannonia, who from an obscure condition had raised himself, by matchless
strength and dexterity, to the military commands of Africa and Britain;
from which he retired with an ample fortune and suspicious integrity.
The rank and services of Gratian contributed, however, to smooth the
first steps of the promotion of his son; and afforded him an early
opportunity of displaying those solid and useful qualifications, which
raised his character above the ordinary level of his fellow-soldiers.
The person of Valentinian was tall, graceful, and majestic. His manly
countenance, deeply marked with the impression of sense and spirit,
inspired his friends with awe, and his enemies with fear; and to second
the efforts of his undaunted courage, the son of Gratian had inherited
the advantages of a strong and healthy constitution. By the habits of
chastity and temperance, which restrain the appetites and invigorate
the faculties, Valentinian preserved his own and the public esteem. The
avocations of a military life had diverted his youth from the elegant
pursuits of literature; <a href="#note-2111" name="noteref-2111"><small>2111</small></a> he was ignorant of the Greek language,
and the arts of rhetoric; but as the mind of the orator was never
disconcerted by timid perplexity, he was able, as often as the occasion
prompted him, to deliver his decided sentiments with bold and ready
elocution. The laws of martial discipline were the only laws that he had
studied; and he was soon distinguished by the laborious diligence, and
inflexible severity, with which he discharged and enforced the duties of
the camp. In the time of Julian he provoked the danger of disgrace, by
the contempt which he publicly expressed for the reigning religion; <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a>
and it should seem, from his subsequent conduct, that the indiscreet and
unseasonable freedom of Valentinian was the effect of military spirit,
rather than of Christian zeal. He was pardoned, however, and still
employed by a prince who esteemed his merit; <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> and in the various
events of the Persian war, he improved the reputation which he had
already acquired on the banks of the Rhine. The celerity and success
with which he executed an important commission, recommended him to the
favor of Jovian; and to the honorable command of the second school,
or company, of Targetiers, of the domestic guards. In the march from
Antioch, he had reached his quarters at Ancyra, when he was unexpectedly
summoned, without guilt and without intrigue, to assume, in the
forty-third year of his age, the absolute government of the Roman
empire.

<p>
The invitation of the ministers and generals at Nice was of little
moment, unless it were confirmed by the voice of the army.
</p>
<p>
The aged Sallust, who had long observed the irregular fluctuations of
popular assemblies, proposed, under pain of death, that none of those
persons, whose rank in the service might excite a party in their favor,
should appear in public on the day of the inauguration. Yet such was
the prevalence of ancient superstition, that a whole day was voluntarily
added to this dangerous interval, because it happened to be the
intercalation of the Bissextile. <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> At length, when the hour was
supposed to be propitious, Valentinian showed himself from a lofty
tribunal; the judicious choice was applauded; and the new prince was
solemnly invested with the diadem and the purple, amidst the acclamation
of the troops, who were disposed in martial order round the tribunal.
But when he stretched forth his hand to address the armed multitude,
a busy whisper was accidentally started in the ranks, and insensibly
swelled into a loud and imperious clamor, that he should name, without
delay, a colleague in the empire. The intrepid calmness of Valentinian
obtained silence, and commanded respect; and he thus addressed the
assembly: "A few minutes since it was in your power, fellow-soldiers,
to have left me in the obscurity of a private station. Judging, from the
testimony of my past life, that I deserved to reign, you have placed me
on the throne. It is now my duty to consult the safety and interest of
the republic. The weight of the universe is undoubtedly too great
for the hands of a feeble mortal. I am conscious of the limits of my
abilities, and the uncertainty of my life; and far from declining, I
am anxious to solicit, the assistance of a worthy colleague. But, where
discord may be fatal, the choice of a faithful friend requires mature
and serious deliberation. That deliberation shall be my care. Let your
conduct be dutiful and consistent. Retire to your quarters; refresh your
minds and bodies; and expect the accustomed donative on the accession of
a new emperor." <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> The astonished troops, with a mixture of pride, of
satisfaction, and of terror, confessed the voice of their master.
</p>
<p>
Their angry clamors subsided into silent reverence; and Valentinian,
encompassed with the eagles of the legions, and the various banners of
the cavalry and infantry, was conducted, in warlike pomp, to the palace
of Nice. As he was sensible, however, of the importance of preventing
some rash declaration of the soldiers, he consulted the assembly of
the chiefs; and their real sentiments were concisely expressed by the
generous freedom of Dagalaiphus. "Most excellent prince," said that
officer, "if you consider only your family, you have a brother; if you
love the republic, look round for the most deserving of the Romans."
<a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> The emperor, who suppressed his displeasure, without altering his
intention, slowly proceeded from Nice to Nicomedia and Constantinople.
In one of the suburbs of that capital, <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> thirty days after his own
elevation, he bestowed the title of Augustus on his brother Valens;
<a href="#note-2711" name="noteref-2711"><small>2711</small></a> and as the boldest patriots were convinced, that their opposition,
without being serviceable to their country, would be fatal to
themselves, the declaration of his absolute will was received with
silent submission. Valens was now in the thirty-sixth year of his age;
but his abilities had never been exercised in any employment, military
or civil; and his character had not inspired the world with any sanguine
expectations. He possessed, however, one quality, which recommended him
to Valentinian, and preserved the domestic peace of the empire; devout
and grateful attachment to his benefactor, whose superiority of genius,
as well as of authority, Valens humbly and cheerfully acknowledged in
every action of his life. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The Empire.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>

<p>
Before Valentinian divided the provinces, he reformed the administration
of the empire. All ranks of subjects, who had been injured or oppressed
under the reign of Julian, were invited to support their public
accusations. The silence of mankind attested the spotless integrity of
the praefect Sallust; <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> and his own pressing solicitations, that
he might be permitted to retire from the business of the state,
were rejected by Valentinian with the most honorable expressions of
friendship and esteem. But among the favorites of the late emperor,
there were many who had abused his credulity or superstition; and who
could no longer hope to be protected either by favor or justice. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a>
The greater part of the ministers of the palace, and the governors of
the provinces, were removed from their respective stations; yet the
eminent merit of some officers was distinguished from the obnoxious
crowd; and, notwithstanding the opposite clamors of zeal and resentment,
the whole proceedings of this delicate inquiry appear to have been
conducted with a reasonable share of wisdom and moderation. <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> The
festivity of a new reign received a short and suspicious interruption
from the sudden illness of the two princes; but as soon as their health
was restored, they left Constantinople in the beginning of the spring.
In the castle, or palace, of Mediana, only three miles from Naissus,
they executed the solemn and final division of the Roman empire. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a>
Valentinian bestowed on his brother the rich praefecture of the East,
from the Lower Danube to the confines of Persia; whilst he reserved for
his immediate government the warlike <a href="#note-3211" name="noteref-3211"><small>3211</small></a> praefectures of Illyricum,
Italy, and Gaul, from the extremity of Greece to the Caledonian rampart,
and from the rampart of Caledonia to the foot of Mount Atlas. The
provincial administration remained on its former basis; but a double
supply of generals and magistrates was required for two councils, and
two courts: the division was made with a just regard to their peculiar
merit and situation, and seven master-generals were soon created,
either of the cavalry or infantry. When this important business had been
amicably transacted, Valentinian and Valens embraced for the last time.
The emperor of the West established his temporary residence at Milan;
and the emperor of the East returned to Constantinople, to assume the
dominion of fifty provinces, of whose language he was totally ignorant.

</p>
<p>
The tranquility of the East was soon disturbed by rebellion; and the
throne of Valens was threatened by the daring attempts of a rival whose
affinity to the emperor Julian <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> was his sole merit, and had been his
only crime. Procopius had been hastily promoted from the obscure
station of a tribune, and a notary, to the joint command of the army of
Mesopotamia; the public opinion already named him as the successor of
a prince who was destitute of natural heirs; and a vain rumor was
propagated by his friends, or his enemies, that Julian, before the
altar of the Moon at Carrhae, had privately invested Procopius with
the Imperial purple. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> He endeavored, by his dutiful and submissive
behavior, to disarm the jealousy of Jovian; resigned, without a
contest, his military command; and retired, with his wife and family,
to cultivate the ample patrimony which he possessed in the province of
Cappadocia. These useful and innocent occupations were interrupted by
the appearance of an officer with a band of soldiers, who, in the name
of his new sovereigns, Valentinian and Valens, was despatched to conduct
the unfortunate Procopius either to a perpetual prison or an ignominious
death. His presence of mind procured him a longer respite, and a more
splendid fate. Without presuming to dispute the royal mandate, he
requested the indulgence of a few moments to embrace his weeping
family; and while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by a plentiful
entertainment, he dexterously escaped to the sea-coast of the Euxine,
from whence he passed over to the country of Bosphorus. In that
sequestered region he remained many months, exposed to the hardships of
exile, of solitude, and of want; his melancholy temper brooding over his
misfortunes, and his mind agitated by the just apprehension, that, if
any accident should discover his name, the faithless Barbarians would
violate, without much scruple, the laws of hospitality. In a moment of
impatience and despair, Procopius embarked in a merchant vessel, which
made sail for Constantinople; and boldly aspired to the rank of a
sovereign, because he was not allowed to enjoy the security of a
subject. At first he lurked in the villages of Bithynia, continually
changing his habitation and his disguise. <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> By degrees he ventured
into the capital, trusted his life and fortune to the fidelity of two
friends, a senator and a eunuch, and conceived some hopes of success,
from the intelligence which he obtained of the actual state of
public affairs. The body of the people was infected with a spirit of
discontent: they regretted the justice and the abilities of Sallust, who
had been imprudently dismissed from the praefecture of the East. They
despised the character of Valens, which was rude without vigor,
and feeble without mildness. They dreaded the influence of his
father-in-law, the patrician Petronius, a cruel and rapacious minister,
who rigorously exacted all the arrears of tribute that might remain
unpaid since the reign of the emperor Aurelian. The circumstances were
propitious to the designs of a usurper. The hostile measures of the
Persians required the presence of Valens in Syria: from the Danube
to the Euphrates the troops were in motion; and the capital was
occasionally filled with the soldiers who passed or repassed the
Thracian Bosphorus. Two cohorts of Gaul were persuaded to listen to
the secret proposals of the conspirators; which were recommended by the
promise of a liberal donative; and, as they still revered the memory
of Julian, they easily consented to support the hereditary claim of his
proscribed kinsman. At the dawn of day they were drawn up near the baths
of Anastasia; and Procopius, clothed in a purple garment, more suitable
to a player than to a monarch, appeared, as if he rose from the dead,
in the midst of Constantinople. The soldiers, who were prepared for his
reception, saluted their trembling prince with shouts of joy and vows
of fidelity. Their numbers were soon increased by a band of sturdy
peasants, collected from the adjacent country; and Procopius, shielded
by the arms of his adherents, was successively conducted to the
tribunal, the senate, and the palace. During the first moments of his
tumultuous reign, he was astonished and terrified by the gloomy silence
of the people; who were either ignorant of the cause, or apprehensive
of the event. But his military strength was superior to any actual
resistance: the malecontents flocked to the standard of rebellion; the
poor were excited by the hopes, and the rich were intimidated by the
fear, of a general pillage; and the obstinate credulity of the multitude
was once more deceived by the promised advantages of a revolution. The
magistrates were seized; the prisons and arsenals broke open; the gates,
and the entrance of the harbor, were diligently occupied; and, in a few
hours, Procopius became the absolute, though precarious, master of the
Imperial city. <a href="#note-3611" name="noteref-3611"><small>3611</small></a> The usurper improved this unexpected success with
some degree of courage and dexterity. He artfully propagated the rumors
and opinions the most favorable to his interest; while he deluded the
populace by giving audience to the frequent, but imaginary, ambassadors
of distant nations. The large bodies of troops stationed in the cities
of Thrace and the fortresses of the Lower Danube, were gradually
involved in the guilt of rebellion: and the Gothic princes consented to
supply the sovereign of Constantinople with the formidable strength of
several thousand auxiliaries. His generals passed the Bosphorus, and
subdued, without an effort, the unarmed, but wealthy provinces of
Bithynia and Asia. After an honorable defence, the city and island of
Cyzicus yielded to his power; the renowned legions of the Jovians and
Herculeans embraced the cause of the usurper, whom they were ordered to
crush; and, as the veterans were continually augmented with new levies,
he soon appeared at the head of an army, whose valor, as well as
numbers, were not unequal to the greatness of the contest. The son of
Hormisdas, <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> a youth of spirit and ability, condescended to draw his
sword against the lawful emperor of the East; and the Persian prince
was immediately invested with the ancient and extraordinary powers of
a Roman Proconsul. The alliance of Faustina, the widow of the emperor
Constantius, who intrusted herself and her daughter to the hands of
the usurper, added dignity and reputation to his cause. The princess
Constantia, who was then about five years of age, accompanied, in a
litter, the march of the army. She was shown to the multitude in the
arms of her adopted father; and, as often as she passed through the
ranks, the tenderness of the soldiers was inflamed into martial fury:
<a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> they recollected the glories of the house of Constantine, and they
declared, with loyal acclamation, that they would shed the last drop of
their blood in the defence of the royal infant. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a>

<p>
In the mean while Valentinian was alarmed and perplexed by the doubtful
intelligence of the revolt of the East. <a href="#note-3911" name="noteref-3911"><small>3911</small></a> The difficulties of a
German was forced him to confine his immediate care to the safety of
his own dominions; and, as every channel of communication was stopped or
corrupted, he listened, with doubtful anxiety, to the rumors which
were industriously spread, that the defeat and death of Valens had left
Procopius sole master of the Eastern provinces. Valens was not dead: but
on the news of the rebellion, which he received at Caesarea, he basely
despaired of his life and fortune; proposed to negotiate with the
usurper, and discovered his secret inclination to abdicate the Imperial
purple. The timid monarch was saved from disgrace and ruin by the
firmness of his ministers, and their abilities soon decided in his favor
the event of the civil war. In a season of tranquillity, Sallust
had resigned without a murmur; but as soon as the public safety was
attacked, he ambitiously solicited the preeminence of toil and danger;
and the restoration of that virtuous minister to the praefecture of the
East, was the first step which indicated the repentance of Valens, and
satisfied the minds of the people. The reign of Procopius was apparently
supported by powerful armies and obedient provinces. But many of the
principal officers, military as well as civil, had been urged, either
by motives of duty or interest, to withdraw themselves from the guilty
scene; or to watch the moment of betraying, and deserting, the cause of
the usurper. Lupicinus advanced by hasty marches, to bring the legions
of Syria to the aid of Valens. Arintheus, who, in strength, beauty, and
valor, excelled all the heroes of the age, attacked with a small troop
a superior body of the rebels. When he beheld the faces of the soldiers
who had served under his banner, he commanded them, with a loud voice,
to seize and deliver up their pretended leader; and such was the
ascendant of his genius, that this extraordinary order was instantly
obeyed. <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> Arbetio, a respectable veteran of the great Constantine,
who had been distinguished by the honors of the consulship, was
persuaded to leave his retirement, and once more to conduct an army
into the field. In the heat of action, calmly taking off his helmet, he
showed his gray hairs and venerable countenance: saluted the soldiers
of Procopius by the endearing names of children and companions, and
exhorted them no longer to support the desperate cause of a contemptible
tyrant; but to follow their old commander, who had so often led them to
honor and victory. In the two engagements of Thyatira <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> and Nacolia,
the unfortunate Procopius was deserted by his troops, who were seduced
by the instructions and example of their perfidious officers. After
wandering some time among the woods and mountains of Phyrgia, he was
betrayed by his desponding followers, conducted to the Imperial
camp, and immediately beheaded. He suffered the ordinary fate of an
unsuccessful usurper; but the acts of cruelty which were exercised by
the conqueror, under the forms of legal justice, excited the pity and
indignation of mankind. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a>

Such indeed are the common and natural fruits of despotism and
rebellion. But the inquisition into the crime of magic, <a href="#note-4211" name="noteref-4211"><small>4211</small></a> which,
under the reign of the two brothers, was so rigorously prosecuted both
at Rome and Antioch, was interpreted as the fatal symptom, either of the
displeasure of Heaven, or of the depravity of mankind. <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> Let us
not hesitate to indulge a liberal pride, that, in the present age,
the enlightened part of Europe has abolished <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> a cruel and odious
prejudice, which reigned in every climate of the globe, and adhered to
every system of religious opinions. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> The nations, and the sects, of
the Roman world, admitted with equal credulity, and similar abhorrence,
the reality of that infernal art, <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> which was able to control the
eternal order of the planets, and the voluntary operations of the human
mind. They dreaded the mysterious power of spells and incantations,
of potent herbs, and execrable rites; which could extinguish or recall
life, inflame the passions of the soul, blast the works of creation,
and extort from the reluctant daemons the secrets of futurity. They
believed, with the wildest inconsistency, that this preternatural
dominion of the air, of earth, and of hell, was exercised, from the
vilest motives of malice or gain, by some wrinkled hags and itinerant
sorcerers, who passed their obscure lives in penury and contempt. <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a>
The arts of magic were equally condemned by the public opinion, and
by the laws of Rome; but as they tended to gratify the most imperious
passions of the heart of man, they were continually proscribed, and
continually practised. <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> An imaginary cause as capable of producing
the most serious and mischievous effects. The dark predictions of the
death of an emperor, or the success of a conspiracy, were calculated
only to stimulate the hopes of ambition, and to dissolve the ties of
fidelity; and the intentional guilt of magic was aggravated by the
actual crimes of treason and sacrilege. <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> Such vain terrors disturbed
the peace of society, and the happiness of individuals; and the harmless
flame which insensibly melted a waxen image, might derive a powerful and
pernicious energy from the affrighted fancy of the person whom it was
maliciously designed to represent. <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> From the infusion of those
herbs, which were supposed to possess a supernatural influence, it was
an easy step to the use of more substantial poison; and the folly of
mankind sometimes became the instrument, and the mask, of the most
atrocious crimes. As soon as the zeal of informers was encouraged by the
ministers of Valens and Valentinian, they could not refuse to listen to
another charge, too frequently mingled in the scenes of domestic guilt;
a charge of a softer and less malignant nature, for which the pious,
though excessive, rigor of Constantine had recently decreed the
punishment of death. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> This deadly and incoherent mixture of treason
and magic, of poison and adultery, afforded infinite gradations of guilt
and innocence, of excuse and aggravation, which in these proceedings
appear to have been confounded by the angry or corrupt passions of the
judges. They easily discovered that the degree of their industry and
discernment was estimated, by the Imperial court, according to the
number of executions that were furnished from the respective tribunals.
It was not without extreme reluctance that they pronounced a sentence of
acquittal; but they eagerly admitted such evidence as was stained with
perjury, or procured by torture, to prove the most improbable charges
against the most respectable characters. The progress of the inquiry
continually opened new subjects of criminal prosecution; the audacious
informer, whose falsehood was detected, retired with impunity; but the
wretched victim, who discovered his real or pretended accomplices, were
seldom permitted to receive the price of his infamy. From the extremity
of Italy and Asia, the young, and the aged, were dragged in chains to
the tribunals of Rome and Antioch. Senators, matrons, and philosophers,
expired in ignominious and cruel tortures. The soldiers, who were
appointed to guard the prisons, declared, with a murmur of pity and
indignation, that their numbers were insufficient to oppose the flight,
or resistance, of the multitude of captives. The wealthiest families
were ruined by fines and confiscations; the most innocent citizens
trembled for their safety; and we may form some notion of the magnitude
of the evil, from the extravagant assertion of an ancient writer,
that, in the obnoxious provinces, the prisoners, the exiles, and the
fugitives, formed the greatest part of the inhabitants. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a>

</p>
<p>
When Tacitus describes the deaths of the innocent and illustrious
Romans, who were sacrificed to the cruelty of the first Caesars, the art
of the historian, or the merit of the sufferers, excites in our breast
the most lively sensations of terror, of admiration, and of pity. The
coarse and undistinguishing pencil of Ammianus has delineated his bloody
figures with tedious and disgusting accuracy. But as our attention is
no longer engaged by the contrast of freedom and servitude, of recent
greatness and of actual misery, we should turn with horror from the
frequent executions, which disgraced, both at Rome and Antioch,
the reign of the two brothers. <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> Valens was of a timid, <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> and
Valentinian of a choleric, disposition. <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> An anxious regard to
his personal safety was the ruling principle of the administration of
Valens. In the condition of a subject, he had kissed, with trembling
awe, the hand of the oppressor; and when he ascended the throne, he
reasonably expected, that the same fears, which had subdued his own
mind, would secure the patient submission of his people. The favorites
of Valens obtained, by the privilege of rapine and confiscation, the
wealth which his economy would have refused. <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> They urged, with
persuasive eloquence, that, in all cases of treason, suspicion is
equivalent to proof; that the power supposes the intention, of mischief;
that the intention is not less criminal than the act; and that a subject
no longer deserves to live, if his life may threaten the safety, or
disturb the repose, of his sovereign. The judgment of Valentinian
was sometimes deceived, and his confidence abused; but he would have
silenced the informers with a contemptuous smile, had they presumed to
alarm his fortitude by the sound of danger. They praised his inflexible
love of justice; and, in the pursuit of justice, the emperor was easily
tempted to consider clemency as a weakness, and passion as a virtue.
As long as he wrestled with his equals, in the bold competition of an
active and ambitious life, Valentinian was seldom injured, and never
insulted, with impunity: if his prudence was arraigned, his spirit was
applauded; and the proudest and most powerful generals were apprehensive
of provoking the resentment of a fearless soldier. After he became
master of the world, he unfortunately forgot, that where no resistance
can be made, no courage can be exerted; and instead of consulting the
dictates of reason and magnanimity, he indulged the furious emotions of
his temper, at a time when they were disgraceful to himself, and fatal
to the defenceless objects of his displeasure. In the government of
his household, or of his empire, slight, or even imaginary, offences&mdash;a
hasty word, a casual omission, an involuntary delay&mdash;were chastised by
a sentence of immediate death. The expressions which issued the most
readily from the mouth of the emperor of the West were, "Strike off his
head;" "Burn him alive;" "Let him be beaten with clubs till he expires;"
<a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> and his most favored ministers soon understood, that, by a
rash attempt to dispute, or suspend, the execution of his sanguinary
commands, they might involve themselves in the guilt and punishment of
disobedience. The repeated gratification of this savage justice hardened
the mind of Valentinian against pity and remorse; and the sallies of
passion were confirmed by the habits of cruelty. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> He could behold
with calm satisfaction the convulsive agonies of torture and death; he
reserved his friendship for those faithful servants whose temper was the
most congenial to his own. The merit of Maximin, who had slaughtered the
noblest families of Rome, was rewarded with the royal approbation, and
the praefecture of Gaul.
</p>
<p>
Two fierce and enormous bears, distinguished by the appellations of
Innocence, and Mica Aurea, could alone deserve to share the favor of
Maximin. The cages of those trusty guards were always placed near the
bed-chamber of Valentinian, who frequently amused his eyes with the
grateful spectacle of seeing them tear and devour the bleeding limbs
of the malefactors who were abandoned to their rage. Their diet and
exercises were carefully inspected by the Roman emperor; and when
Innocence had earned her discharge, by a long course of meritorious
service, the faithful animal was again restored to the freedom of her
native woods. <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The Empire.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>

<p>
But in the calmer moments of reflection, when the mind of Valens was not
agitated by fear, or that of Valentinian by rage, the tyrant resumed the
sentiments, or at least the conduct, of the father of his country. The
dispassionate judgment of the Western emperor could clearly perceive,
and accurately pursue, his own and the public interest; and the
sovereign of the East, who imitated with equal docility the various
examples which he received from his elder brother, was sometimes
guided by the wisdom and virtue of the praefect Sallust. Both princes
invariably retained, in the purple, the chaste and temperate simplicity
which had adorned their private life; and, under their reign, the
pleasures of the court never cost the people a blush or a sigh. They
gradually reformed many of the abuses of the times of Constantius;
judiciously adopted and improved the designs of Julian and his
successor; and displayed a style and spirit of legislation which might
inspire posterity with the most favorable opinion of their character
and government. It is not from the master of Innocence, that we should
expect the tender regard for the welfare of his subjects, which prompted
Valentinian to condemn the exposition of new-born infants; <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> and to
establish fourteen skilful physicians, with stipends and privileges, in
the fourteen quarters of Rome. The good sense of an illiterate soldier
founded a useful and liberal institution for the education of youth, and
the support of declining science. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> It was his intention, that the
arts of rhetoric and grammar should be taught in the Greek and Latin
languages, in the metropolis of every province; and as the size and
dignity of the school was usually proportioned to the importance of
the city, the academies of Rome and Constantinople claimed a just
and singular preeminence. The fragments of the literary edicts of
Valentinian imperfectly represent the school of Constantinople, which
was gradually improved by subsequent regulations. That school consisted
of thirty-one professors in different branches of learning. One
philosopher, and two lawyers; five sophists, and ten grammarians for
the Greek, and three orators, and ten grammarians for the Latin tongue;
besides seven scribes, or, as they were then styled, antiquarians, whose
laborious pens supplied the public library with fair and correct copies
of the classic writers. The rule of conduct, which was prescribed to the
students, is the more curious, as it affords the first outlines of the
form and discipline of a modern university. It was required, that they
should bring proper certificates from the magistrates of their native
province. Their names, professions, and places of abode, were regularly
entered in a public register.
</p>
<p>
The studious youth were severely prohibited from wasting their time in
feasts, or in the theatre; and the term of their education was limited
to the age of twenty. The praefect of the city was empowered to chastise
the idle and refractory by stripes or expulsion; and he was directed to
make an annual report to the master of the offices, that the knowledge
and abilities of the scholars might be usefully applied to the public
service. The institutions of Valentinian contributed to secure the
benefits of peace and plenty; and the cities were guarded by the
establishment of the Defensors; <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> freely elected as the tribunes and
advocates of the people, to support their rights, and to expose their
grievances, before the tribunals of the civil magistrates, or even
at the foot of the Imperial throne. The finances were diligently
administered by two princes, who had been so long accustomed to the
rigid economy of a private fortune; but in the receipt and application
of the revenue, a discerning eye might observe some difference between
the government of the East and of the West. Valens was persuaded, that
royal liberality can be supplied only by public oppression, and his
ambition never aspired to secure, by their actual distress, the future
strength and prosperity of his people. Instead of increasing the
weight of taxes, which, in the space of forty years, had been gradually
doubled, he reduced, in the first years of his reign, one fourth of
the tribute of the East. <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> Valentinian appears to have been less
attentive and less anxious to relieve the burdens of his people. He
might reform the abuses of the fiscal administration; but he exacted,
without scruple, a very large share of the private property; as he was
convinced, that the revenues, which supported the luxury of individuals,
would be much more advantageously employed for the defence and
improvement of the state. The subjects of the East, who enjoyed the
present benefit, applauded the indulgence of their prince. The solid
but less splendid, merit of Valentinian was felt and acknowledged by the
subsequent generation. <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a>

</p>
<p>
But the most honorable circumstance of the character of Valentinian, is
the firm and temperate impartiality which he uniformly preserved in
an age of religious contention. His strong sense, unenlightened, but
uncorrupted, by study, declined, with respectful indifference, the
subtle questions of theological debate. The government of the Earth
claimed his vigilance, and satisfied his ambition; and while he
remembered that he was the disciple of the church, he never forgot that
he was the sovereign of the clergy. Under the reign of an apostate, he
had signalized his zeal for the honor of Christianity: he allowed to his
subjects the privilege which he had assumed for himself; and they might
accept, with gratitude and confidence, the general toleration which was
granted by a prince addicted to passion, but incapable of fear or of
disguise. <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> The Pagans, the Jews, and all the various sects which
acknowledged the divine authority of Christ, were protected by the laws
from arbitrary power or popular insult; nor was any mode of worship
prohibited by Valentinian, except those secret and criminal practices,
which abused the name of religion for the dark purposes of vice and
disorder. The art of magic, as it was more cruelly punished, was more
strictly proscribed: but the emperor admitted a formal distinction to
protect the ancient methods of divination, which were approved by the
senate, and exercised by the Tuscan haruspices. He had condemned,
with the consent of the most rational Pagans, the license of nocturnal
sacrifices; but he immediately admitted the petition of Praetextatus,
proconsul of Achaia, who represented, that the life of the Greeks would
become dreary and comfortless, if they were deprived of the invaluable
blessing of the Eleusinian mysteries. Philosophy alone can boast, (and
perhaps it is no more than the boast of philosophy,) that her gentle
hand is able to eradicate from the human mind the latent and deadly
principle of fanaticism. But this truce of twelve years, which was
enforced by the wise and vigorous government of Valentinian, by
suspending the repetition of mutual injuries, contributed to soften the
manners, and abate the prejudices, of the religious factions.

</p>
<p>
The friend of toleration was unfortunately placed at a distance from the
scene of the fiercest controversies. As soon as the Christians of the
West had extricated themselves from the snares of the creed of Rimini,
they happily relapsed into the slumber of orthodoxy; and the small
remains of the Arian party, that still subsisted at Sirmium or Milan,
might be considered rather as objects of contempt than of resentment.
But in the provinces of the East, from the Euxine to the extremity of
Thebais, the strength and numbers of the hostile factions were more
equally balanced; and this equality, instead of recommending the
counsels of peace, served only to perpetuate the horrors of religious
war. The monks and bishops supported their arguments by invectives;
and their invectives were sometimes followed by blows. Athanasius still
reigned at Alexandria; the thrones of Constantinople and Antioch were
occupied by Arian prelates, and every episcopal vacancy was the
occasion of a popular tumult. The Homoousians were fortified by the
reconciliation of fifty-nine Macelonian, or Semi-Arian, bishops; but
their secret reluctance to embrace the divinity of the Holy Ghost,
clouded the splendor of the triumph; and the declaration of Valens, who,
in the first years of his reign, had imitated the impartial conduct of
his brother, was an important victory on the side of Arianism. The two
brothers had passed their private life in the condition of catechumens;
but the piety of Valens prompted him to solicit the sacrament of
baptism, before he exposed his person to the dangers of a Gothic war.
He naturally addressed himself to Eudoxus, <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> <a href="#note-6611" name="noteref-6611"><small>6611</small></a> bishop of the
Imperial city; and if the ignorant monarch was instructed by that Arian
pastor in the principles of heterodox theology, his misfortune, rather
than his guilt, was the inevitable consequence of his erroneous choice.
Whatever had been the determination of the emperor, he must have
offended a numerous party of his Christian subjects; as the leaders both
of the Homoousians and of the Arians believed, that, if they were not
suffered to reign, they were most cruelly injured and oppressed. After
he had taken this decisive step, it was extremely difficult for him to
preserve either the virtue, or the reputation of impartiality. He never
aspired, like Constantius, to the fame of a profound theologian; but
as he had received with simplicity and respect the tenets of Euxodus,
Valens resigned his conscience to the direction of his ecclesiastical
guides, and promoted, by the influence of his authority, the reunion of
the Athanasian heretics to the body of the Catholic church. At first, he
pitied their blindness; by degrees he was provoked at their obstinacy;
and he insensibly hated those sectaries to whom he was an object of
hatred. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> The feeble mind of Valens was always swayed by the persons
with whom he familiarly conversed; and the exile or imprisonment of a
private citizen are the favors the most readily granted in a despotic
court. Such punishments were frequently inflicted on the leaders of
the Homoousian party; and the misfortune of fourscore ecclesiastics of
Constantinople, who, perhaps accidentally, were burned on shipboard,
was imputed to the cruel and premeditated malice of the emperor, and his
Arian ministers. In every contest, the Catholics (if we may anticipate
that name) were obliged to pay the penalty of their own faults, and of
those of their adversaries. In every election, the claims of the Arian
candidate obtained the preference; and if they were opposed by the
majority of the people, he was usually supported by the authority of
the civil magistrate, or even by the terrors of a military force.
The enemies of Athanasius attempted to disturb the last years of his
venerable age; and his temporary retreat to his father's sepulchre has
been celebrated as a fifth exile. But the zeal of a great people, who
instantly flew to arms, intimidated the praefect: and the archbishop
was permitted to end his life in peace and in glory, after a reign
of forty-seven years. The death of Athanasius was the signal of the
persecution of Egypt; and the Pagan minister of Valens, who forcibly
seated the worthless Lucius on the archiepiscopal throne, purchased
the favor of the reigning party, by the blood and sufferings of their
Christian brethren. The free toleration of the heathen and Jewish
worship was bitterly lamented, as a circumstance which aggravated the
misery of the Catholics, and the guilt of the impious tyrant of the
East. <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a>

and the immense compilations of Tillemont, (particularly tom. vi. viii.

</p>
<p>
The triumph of the orthodox party has left a deep stain of persecution
on the memory of Valens; and the character of a prince who derived
his virtues, as well as his vices, from a feeble understanding and a
pusillanimous temper, scarcely deserves the labor of an apology. Yet
candor may discover some reasons to suspect that the ecclesiastical
ministers of Valens often exceeded the orders, or even the intentions,
of their master; and that the real measure of facts has been very
liberally magnified by the vehement declamation and easy credulity
of his antagonists. <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> 1. The silence of Valentinian may suggest a
probable argument that the partial severities, which were exercised in
the name and provinces of his colleague, amounted only to some obscure
and inconsiderable deviations from the established system of religious
toleration: and the judicious historian, who has praised the equal
temper of the elder brother, has not thought himself obliged to contrast
the tranquillity of the West with the cruel persecution of the East.
<a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> 2. Whatever credit may be allowed to vague and distant reports, the
character, or at least the behavior, of Valens, may be most distinctly
seen in his personal transactions with the eloquent Basil, archbishop
of Caesarea, who had succeeded Athanasius in the management of the
Trinitarian cause. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> The circumstantial narrative has been composed
by the friends and admirers of Basil; and as soon as we have stripped
away a thick coat of rhetoric and miracle, we shall be astonished by the
unexpected mildness of the Arian tyrant, who admired the firmness of his
character, or was apprehensive, if he employed violence, of a general
revolt in the province of Cappadocia. The archbishop, who asserted, with
inflexible pride, <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> the truth of his opinions, and the dignity of his
rank, was left in the free possession of his conscience and his throne.
The emperor devoutly assisted at the solemn service of the cathedral;
and, instead of a sentence of banishment, subscribed the donation of
a valuable estate for the use of a hospital, which Basil had lately
founded in the neighborhood of Caesarea. <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> 3. I am not able to
discover, that any law (such as Theodosius afterwards enacted against
the Arians) was published by Valens against the Athanasian sectaries;
and the edict which excited the most violent clamors, may not appear so
extremely reprehensible. The emperor had observed, that several of
his subjects, gratifying their lazy disposition under the pretence of
religion, had associated themselves with the monks of Egypt; and he
directed the count of the East to drag them from their solitude; and
to compel these deserters of society to accept the fair alternative
of renouncing their temporal possessions, or of discharging the public
duties of men and citizens. <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> The ministers of Valens seem to have
extended the sense of this penal statute, since they claimed a right
of enlisting the young and ablebodied monks in the Imperial armies. A
detachment of cavalry and infantry, consisting of three thousand men,
marched from Alexandria into the adjacent desert of Nitria, <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> which
was peopled by five thousand monks. The soldiers were conducted by Arian
priests; and it is reported, that a considerable slaughter was made in
the monasteries which disobeyed the commands of their sovereign. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The strict regulations which have been framed by the wisdom of modern
legislators to restrain the wealth and avarice of the clergy, may be
originally deduced from the example of the emperor Valentinian. His
edict, <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> addressed to Damasus, bishop of Rome, was publicly read in
the churches of the city. He admonished the ecclesiastics and monks
not to frequent the houses of widows and virgins; and menaced their
disobedience with the animadversion of the civil judge. The director was
no longer permitted to receive any gift, or legacy, or inheritance, from
the liberality of his spiritual-daughter: every testament contrary to
this edict was declared null and void; and the illegal donation was
confiscated for the use of the treasury. By a subsequent regulation, it
should seem, that the same provisions were extended to nuns and bishops;
and that all persons of the ecclesiastical order were rendered incapable
of receiving any testamentary gifts, and strictly confined to the
natural and legal rights of inheritance. As the guardian of domestic
happiness and virtue, Valentinian applied this severe remedy to the
growing evil. In the capital of the empire, the females of noble and
opulent houses possessed a very ample share of independent property: and
many of those devout females had embraced the doctrines of Christianity,
not only with the cold assent of the understanding, but with the warmth
of affection, and perhaps with the eagerness of fashion. They sacrificed
the pleasures of dress and luxury; and renounced, for the praise of
chastity, the soft endearments of conjugal society. Some ecclesiastic,
of real or apparent sanctity, was chosen to direct their timorous
conscience, and to amuse the vacant tenderness of their heart: and the
unbounded confidence, which they hastily bestowed, was often abused by
knaves and enthusiasts; who hastened from the extremities of the
East, to enjoy, on a splendid theatre, the privileges of the monastic
profession. By their contempt of the world, they insensibly acquired its
most desirable advantages; the lively attachment, perhaps of a young and
beautiful woman, the delicate plenty of an opulent household, and the
respectful homage of the slaves, the freedmen, and the clients of
a senatorial family. The immense fortunes of the Roman ladies were
gradually consumed in lavish alms and expensive pilgrimages; and the
artful monk, who had assigned himself the first, or possibly the sole
place, in the testament of his spiritual daughter, still presumed
to declare, with the smooth face of hypocrisy, that he was only the
instrument of charity, and the steward of the poor. The lucrative, but
disgraceful, trade, <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> which was exercised by the clergy to defraud
the expectations of the natural heirs, had provoked the indignation of a
superstitious age: and two of the most respectable of the Latin fathers
very honestly confess, that the ignominious edict of Valentinian was
just and necessary; and that the Christian priests had deserved to lose
a privilege, which was still enjoyed by comedians, charioteers, and the
ministers of idols. But the wisdom and authority of the legislator are
seldom victorious in a contest with the vigilant dexterity of private
interest; and Jerom, or Ambrose, might patiently acquiesce in the
justice of an ineffectual or salutary law. If the ecclesiastics were
checked in the pursuit of personal emolument, they would exert a more
laudable industry to increase the wealth of the church; and dignify
their covetousness with the specious names of piety and patriotism. <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a>

<p>
Damasus, bishop of Rome, who was constrained to stigmatize
the avarice of his clergy by the publication of the law of Valentinian,
had the good sense, or the good fortune, to engage in his service the
zeal and abilities of the learned Jerom; and the grateful saint has
celebrated the merit and purity of a very ambiguous character. <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> But
the splendid vices of the church of Rome, under the reign of Valentinian
and Damasus, have been curiously observed by the historian Ammianus, who
delivers his impartial sense in these expressive words: "The praefecture
of Juventius was accompanied with peace and plenty, but the tranquillity
of his government was soon disturbed by a bloody sedition of the
distracted people. The ardor of Damasus and Ursinus, to seize the
episcopal seat, surpassed the ordinary measure of human ambition. They
contended with the rage of party; the quarrel was maintained by the
wounds and death of their followers; and the praefect, unable to resist
or appease the tumult, was constrained, by superior violence, to retire
into the suburbs. Damasus prevailed: the well-disputed victory remained
on the side of his faction; one hundred and thirty-seven dead bodies
<a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> were found in the Basilica of Sicininus, <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a> where the Christians
hold their religious assemblies; and it was long before the angry minds
of the people resumed their accustomed tranquillity. When I consider the
splendor of the capital, I am not astonished that so valuable a prize
should inflame the desires of ambitious men, and produce the fiercest
and most obstinate contests. The successful candidate is secure, that he
will be enriched by the offerings of matrons; <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> that, as soon as his
dress is composed with becoming care and elegance, he may proceed,
in his chariot, through the streets of Rome; <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> and that the
sumptuousness of the Imperial table will not equal the profuse and
delicate entertainments provided by the taste, and at the expense,
of the Roman pontiffs. How much more rationally (continues the honest
Pagan) would those pontiffs consult their true happiness, if, instead of
alleging the greatness of the city as an excuse for their manners,
they would imitate the exemplary life of some provincial bishops,
whose temperance and sobriety, whose mean apparel and downcast looks,
recommend their pure and modest virtue to the Deity and his true
worshippers!" <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> The schism of Damasus and Ursinus was extinguished
by the exile of the latter; and the wisdom of the praefect Praetextatus
<a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> restored the tranquillity of the city. Praetextatus was a
philosophic Pagan, a man of learning, of taste, and politeness; who
disguised a reproach in the form of a jest, when he assured Damasus,
that if he could obtain the bishopric of Rome, he himself would
immediately embrace the Christian religion. <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a> This lively picture
of the wealth and luxury of the popes in the fourth century becomes
the more curious, as it represents the intermediate degree between the
humble poverty of the apostolic fishermen, and the royal state of a
temporal prince, whose dominions extend from the confines of Naples to
the banks of the Po.

<h2>
    Chapter XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The Empire.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>

<p>
When the suffrage of the generals and of the army committed the sceptre
of the Roman empire to the hands of Valentinian, his reputation in
arms, his military skill and experience, and his rigid attachment to
the forms, as well as spirit, of ancient discipline, were the principal
motives of their judicious choice.
</p>
<p>
The eagerness of the troops, who pressed him to nominate his colleague,
was justified by the dangerous situation of public affairs; and
Valentinian himself was conscious, that the abilities of the most active
mind were unequal to the defence of the distant frontiers of an invaded
monarchy. As soon as the death of Julian had relieved the Barbarians
from the terror of his name, the most sanguine hopes of rapine and
conquest excited the nations of the East, of the North, and of the
South. Their inroads were often vexatious, and sometimes formidable;
but, during the twelve years of the reign of Valentinian, his firmness
and vigilance protected his own dominions; and his powerful genius
seemed to inspire and direct the feeble counsels of his brother. Perhaps
the method of annals would more forcibly express the urgent and divided
cares of the two emperors; but the attention of the reader, likewise,
would be distracted by a tedious and desultory narrative. A separate
view of the five great theatres of war; I. Germany; II. Britain; III.
Africa; IV. The East; and, V. The Danube; will impress a more
distinct image of the military state of the empire under the reigns of
Valentinian and Valens.
</p>
<p>
I. The ambassadors of the Alemanni had been offended by the harsh and
haughty behavior of Ursacius, master of the offices; <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> who by an
act of unseasonable parsimony, had diminished the value, as well as
the quantity, of the presents to which they were entitled, either from
custom or treaty, on the accession of a new emperor. They expressed,
and they communicated to their countrymen, their strong sense of the
national affront. The irascible minds of the chiefs were exasperated
by the suspicion of contempt; and the martial youth crowded to their
standard. Before Valentinian could pass the Alps, the villages of Gaul
were in flames; before his general Degalaiphus could encounter the
Alemanni, they had secured the captives and the spoil in the forests of
Germany. In the beginning of the ensuing year, the military force of the
whole nation, in deep and solid columns, broke through the barrier of
the Rhine, during the severity of a northern winter. Two Roman counts
were defeated and mortally wounded; and the standard of the Heruli and
Batavians fell into the hands of the Heruli and Batavians fell into
the hands of the conquerors, who displayed, with insulting shouts and
menaces, the trophy of their victory. The standard was recovered; but
the Batavians had not redeemed the shame of their disgrace and flight in
the eyes of their severe judge. It was the opinion of Valentinian, that
his soldiers must learn to fear their commander, before they could cease
to fear the enemy. The troops were solemnly assembled; and the trembling
Batavians were enclosed within the circle of the Imperial army.
Valentinian then ascended his tribunal; and, as if he disdained to
punish cowardice with death, he inflicted a stain of indelible ignominy
on the officers, whose misconduct and pusillanimity were found to be
the first occasion of the defeat. The Batavians were degraded from their
rank, stripped of their arms, and condemned to be sold for slaves to the
highest bidder. At this tremendous sentence, the troops fell prostrate
on the ground, deprecated the indignation of their sovereign, and
protested, that, if he would indulge them in another trial, they would
approve themselves not unworthy of the name of Romans, and of his
soldiers. Valentinian, with affected reluctance, yielded to their
entreaties; the Batavians resumed their arms, and with their arms, the
invincible resolution of wiping away their disgrace in the blood of the
Alemanni. <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> The principal command was declined by Dagalaiphus; and
that experienced general, who had represented, perhaps with too
much prudence, the extreme difficulties of the undertaking, had the
mortification, before the end of the campaign, of seeing his rival
Jovinus convert those difficulties into a decisive advantage over the
scattered forces of the Barbarians. At the head of a well-disciplined
army of cavalry, infantry, and light troops, Jovinus advanced, with
cautious and rapid steps, to Scarponna, <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a> <a href="#note-9011" name="noteref-9011"><small>9011</small></a> in the territory of
Metz, where he surprised a large division of the Alemanni, before
they had time to run to their arms; and flushed his soldiers with the
confidence of an easy and bloodless victory. Another division, or
rather army, of the enemy, after the cruel and wanton devastation of the
adjacent country, reposed themselves on the shady banks of the Moselle.
Jovinus, who had viewed the ground with the eye of a general, made a
silent approach through a deep and woody vale, till he could distinctly
perceive the indolent security of the Germans. Some were bathing their
huge limbs in the river; others were combing their long and flaxen hair;
others again were swallowing large draughts of rich and delicious wine.
On a sudden they heard the sound of the Roman trumpet; they saw the
enemy in their camp. Astonishment produced disorder; disorder was
followed by flight and dismay; and the confused multitude of the bravest
warriors was pierced by the swords and javelins of the legionaries and
auxiliaries. The fugitives escaped to the third, and most considerable,
camp, in the Catalonian plains, near Chalons in Champagne: the
straggling detachments were hastily recalled to their standard; and
the Barbarian chiefs, alarmed and admonished by the fate of their
companions, prepared to encounter, in a decisive battle, the victorious
forces of the lieutenant of Valentinian. The bloody and obstinate
conflict lasted a whole summer's day, with equal valor, and with
alternate success. The Romans at length prevailed, with the loss of
about twelve hundred men. Six thousand of the Alemanni were slain, four
thousand were wounded; and the brave Jovinus, after chasing the flying
remnant of their host as far as the banks of the Rhine, returned to
Paris, to receive the applause of his sovereign, and the ensigns of
the consulship for the ensuing year. <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a> The triumph of the Romans was
indeed sullied by their treatment of the captive king, whom they hung
on a gibbet, without the knowledge of their indignant general. This
disgraceful act of cruelty, which might be imputed to the fury of the
troops, was followed by the deliberate murder of Withicab, the son of
Vadomair; a German prince, of a weak and sickly constitution, but of a
daring and formidable spirit. The domestic assassin was instigated and
protected by the Romans; <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> and the violation of the laws of humanity
and justice betrayed their secret apprehension of the weakness of the
declining empire. The use of the dagger is seldom adopted in public
councils, as long as they retain any confidence in the power of the
sword.

While the Alemanni appeared to be humbled by their recent calamities,
the pride of Valentinian was mortified by the unexpected surprisal of
Moguntiacum, or Mentz, the principal city of the Upper Germany. In the
unsuspicious moment of a Christian festival, <a href="#note-9211" name="noteref-9211"><small>9211</small></a> Rando, a bold and
artful chieftain, who had long meditated his attempt, suddenly passed
the Rhine; entered the defenceless town, and retired with a multitude of
captives of either sex. Valentinian resolved to execute severe vengeance
on the whole body of the nation. Count Sebastian, with the bands of
Italy and Illyricum, was ordered to invade their country, most probably
on the side of Rhaetia. The emperor in person, accompanied by his son
Gratian, passed the Rhine at the head of a formidable army, which was
supported on both flanks by Jovinus and Severus, the two masters-general
of the cavalry and infantry of the West. The Alemanni, unable to prevent
the devastation of their villages, fixed their camp on a lofty, and
almost inaccessible, mountain, in the modern duchy of Wirtemberg, and
resolutely expected the approach of the Romans. The life of Valentinian
was exposed to imminent danger by the intrepid curiosity with which
he persisted to explore some secret and unguarded path. A troop of
Barbarians suddenly rose from their ambuscade: and the emperor, who
vigorously spurred his horse down a steep and slippery descent,
was obliged to leave behind him his armor-bearer, and his helmet,
magnificently enriched with gold and precious stones. At the signal
of the general assault, the Roman troops encompassed and ascended the
mountain of Solicinium on three different sides. <a href="#note-9212" name="noteref-9212"><small>9212</small></a> Every step which
they gained, increased their ardor, and abated the resistance of the
enemy: and after their united forces had occupied the summit of the
hill, they impetuously urged the Barbarians down the northern descent,
where Count Sebastian was posted to intercept their retreat. After this
signal victory, Valentinian returned to his winter quarters at Treves;
where he indulged the public joy by the exhibition of splendid and
triumphal games. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> But the wise monarch, instead of aspiring to
the conquest of Germany, confined his attention to the important
and laborious defence of the Gallic frontier, against an enemy whose
strength was renewed by a stream of daring volunteers, which incessantly
flowed from the most distant tribes of the North. <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> The banks of the
Rhine <a href="#note-9411" name="noteref-9411"><small>9411</small></a> from its source to the straits of the ocean, were closely
planted with strong castles and convenient towers; new works, and new
arms, were invented by the ingenuity of a prince who was skilled in the
mechanical arts; and his numerous levies of Roman and Barbarian youth
were severely trained in all the exercises of war. The progress of
the work, which was sometimes opposed by modest representations, and
sometimes by hostile attempts, secured the tranquillity of Gaul during
the nine subsequent years of the administration of Valentinian. <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a>

of the Alemanni to their easy adoption of strangers. &mdash;&mdash;Note: "This
explanation," says Mr. Malthus, "only removes the difficulty a little
farther off. It makes the earth rest upon the tortoise, but does not
tell us on what the tortoise rests. We may still ask what northern
reservoir supplied this incessant stream of daring adventurers.
Montesquieu's solution of the problem will, I think, hardly be admitted,
(Grandeur et Decadence des Romains, c. 16, p. 187.) * * * The whole
difficulty, however, is at once removed, if we apply to the German
nations, at that time, a fact which is so generally known to have
occurred in America, and suppose that, when not checked by wars and
famine, they increased at a rate that would double their numbers in
twenty-five or thirty years. The propriety, and even the necessity, of
applying this rate of increase to the inhabitants of ancient Germany,
will strikingly appear from that most valuable picture of their manners
which has been left us by Tacitus, (Tac. de Mor. Germ. 16 to 20.) * *
* With these manners, and a habit of enterprise and emigration, which
would naturally remove all fears about providing for a family, it is
difficult to conceive a society with a stronger principle of increase
in it, and we see at once that prolific source of armies and colonies
against which the force of the Roman empire so long struggled with
difficulty, and under which it ultimately sunk. It is not probable that,
for two periods together, or even for one, the population within the
confines of Germany ever doubled itself in twenty-five years. Their
perpetual wars, the rude state of agriculture, and particularly the very
strange custom adopted by most of the tribes of marking their barriers
by extensive deserts, would prevent any very great actual increase of
numbers. At no one period could the country be called well peopled,
though it was often redundant in population. * * * Instead of clearing
their forests, draining their swamps, and rendering their soil fit to
support an extended population, they found it more congenial to their
martial habits and impatient dispositions to go in quest of food, of
plunder, or of glory, into other countries." Malthus on Population, i.

</p>
<p>
That prudent emperor, who diligently practised the wise maxims of
Diocletian, was studious to foment and excite the intestine divisions
of the tribes of Germany. About the middle of the fourth century, the
countries, perhaps of Lusace and Thuringia, on either side of the Elbe,
were occupied by the vague dominion of the Burgundians; a warlike and
numerous people, <a href="#note-9511" name="noteref-9511"><small>9511</small></a> of the Vandal race, <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> whose obscure name
insensibly swelled into a powerful kingdom, and has finally settled on
a flourishing province. The most remarkable circumstance in the ancient
manners of the Burgundians appears to have been the difference of their
civil and ecclesiastical constitution. The appellation of Hendinos was
given to the king or general, and the title of Sinistus to the high
priest, of the nation. The person of the priest was sacred, and his
dignity perpetual; but the temporal government was held by a very
precarious tenure. If the events of war accuses the courage or conduct
of the king, he was immediately deposed; and the injustice of his
subjects made him responsible for the fertility of the earth, and the
regularity of the seasons, which seemed to fall more properly within the
sacerdotal department. <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> The disputed possession of some salt-pits
<a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> engaged the Alemanni and the Burgundians in frequent contests:
the latter were easily tempted, by the secret solicitations and liberal
offers of the emperor; and their fabulous descent from the Roman
soldiers, who had formerly been left to garrison the fortresses of
Drusus, was admitted with mutual credulity, as it was conducive to
mutual interest. <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> An army of fourscore thousand Burgundians soon
appeared on the banks of the Rhine; and impatiently required the support
and subsidies which Valentinian had promised: but they were amused with
excuses and delays, till at length, after a fruitless expectation, they
were compelled to retire. The arms and fortifications of the Gallic
frontier checked the fury of their just resentment; and their
massacre of the captives served to imbitter the hereditary feud of the
Burgundians and the Alemanni. The inconstancy of a wise prince may,
perhaps, be explained by some alteration of circumstances; and perhaps
it was the original design of Valentinian to intimidate, rather than to
destroy; as the balance of power would have been equally overturned by
the extirpation of either of the German nations. Among the princes of
the Alemanni, Macrianus, who, with a Roman name, had assumed the arts of
a soldier and a statesman, deserved his hatred and esteem. The emperor
himself, with a light and unencumbered band, condescended to pass the
Rhine, marched fifty miles into the country, and would infallibly have
seized the object of his pursuit, if his judicious measures had not
been defeated by the impatience of the troops. Macrianus was afterwards
admitted to the honor of a personal conference with the emperor; and
the favors which he received, fixed him, till the hour of his death, a
steady and sincere friend of the republic. <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a>

<p>
The land was covered by the fortifications of Valentinian; but the
sea-coast of Gaul and Britain was exposed to the depredations of the
Saxons. That celebrated name, in which we have a dear and domestic
interest, escaped the notice of Tacitus; and in the maps of Ptolemy, it
faintly marks the narrow neck of the Cimbric peninsula, and three small
islands towards the mouth of the Elbe. <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> This contracted territory,
the present duchy of Sleswig, or perhaps of Holstein, was incapable of
pouring forth the inexhaustible swarms of Saxons who reigned over the
ocean, who filled the British island with their language, their laws,
and their colonies; and who so long defended the liberty of the North
against the arms of Charlemagne. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> The solution of this difficulty
is easily derived from the similar manners, and loose constitution,
of the tribes of Germany; which were blended with each other by the
slightest accidents of war or friendship. The situation of the native
Saxons disposed them to embrace the hazardous professions of fishermen
and pirates; and the success of their first adventures would naturally
excite the emulation of their bravest countrymen, who were impatient of
the gloomy solitude of their woods and mountains. Every tide might float
down the Elbe whole fleets of canoes, filled with hardy and intrepid
associates, who aspired to behold the unbounded prospect of the ocean,
and to taste the wealth and luxury of unknown worlds. It should seem
probable, however, that the most numerous auxiliaries of the Saxons were
furnished by the nations who dwelt along the shores of the Baltic. They
possessed arms and ships, the art of navigation, and the habits of
naval war; but the difficulty of issuing through the northern columns of
Hercules <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> (which, during several months of the year, are obstructed
with ice) confined their skill and courage within the limits of a
spacious lake. The rumor of the successful armaments which sailed from
the mouth of the Elbe, would soon provoke them to cross the narrow
isthmus of Sleswig, and to launch their vessels on the great sea. The
various troops of pirates and adventurers, who fought under the same
standard, were insensibly united in a permanent society, at first of
rapine, and afterwards of government. A military confederation was
gradually moulded into a national body, by the gentle operation of
marriage and consanguinity; and the adjacent tribes, who solicited the
alliance, accepted the name and laws, of the Saxons. If the fact were
not established by the most unquestionable evidence, we should appear to
abuse the credulity of our readers, by the description of the vessels
in which the Saxon pirates ventured to sport in the waves of the German
Ocean, the British Channel, and the Bay of Biscay. The keel of their
large flat-bottomed boats were framed of light timber, but the sides and
upper works consisted only of wicker, with a covering of strong hides.
<a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> In the course of their slow and distant navigations, they must
always have been exposed to the danger, and very frequently to the
misfortune, of shipwreck; and the naval annals of the Saxons were
undoubtedly filled with the accounts of the losses which they sustained
on the coasts of Britain and Gaul. But the daring spirit of the pirates
braved the perils both of the sea and of the shore: their skill was
confirmed by the habits of enterprise; the meanest of their mariners was
alike capable of handling an oar, of rearing a sail, or of conducting
a vessel, and the Saxons rejoiced in the appearance of a tempest, which
concealed their design, and dispersed the fleets of the enemy. <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a>
After they had acquired an accurate knowledge of the maritime provinces
of the West, they extended the scene of their depredations, and the most
sequestered places had no reason to presume on their security. The Saxon
boats drew so little water that they could easily proceed fourscore or
a hundred miles up the great rivers; their weight was so inconsiderable,
that they were transported on wagons from one river to another; and the
pirates who had entered the mouth of the Seine, or of the Rhine, might
descend, with the rapid stream of the Rhone, into the Mediterranean.
Under the reign of Valentinian, the maritime provinces of Gaul were
afflicted by the Saxons: a military count was stationed for the defence
of the sea-coast, or Armorican limit; and that officer, who found his
strength, or his abilities, unequal to the task, implored the assistance
of Severus, master-general of the infantry. The Saxons, surrounded
and outnumbered, were forced to relinquish their spoil, and to yield
a select band of their tall and robust youth to serve in the Imperial
armies. They stipulated only a safe and honorable retreat; and the
condition was readily granted by the Roman general, who meditated an act
of perfidy, <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> imprudent as it was inhuman, while a Saxon remained
alive, and in arms, to revenge the fate of their countrymen. The
premature eagerness of the infantry, who were secretly posted in a deep
valley, betrayed the ambuscade; and they would perhaps have fallen the
victims of their own treachery, if a large body of cuirassiers, alarmed
by the noise of the combat, had not hastily advanced to extricate their
companions, and to overwhelm the undaunted valor of the Saxons. Some of
the prisoners were saved from the edge of the sword, to shed their
blood in the amphitheatre; and the orator Symmachus complains, that
twenty-nine of those desperate savages, by strangling themselves with
their own hands, had disappointed the amusement of the public. Yet the
polite and philosophic citizens of Rome were impressed with the deepest
horror, when they were informed, that the Saxons consecrated to the gods
the tithe of their human spoil; and that they ascertained by lot the
objects of the barbarous sacrifice. <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a>

II. The fabulous colonies of Egyptians and Trojans, of Scandinavians and
Spaniards, which flattered the pride, and amused the credulity, of our
rude ancestors, have insensibly vanished in the light of science and
philosophy. <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a> The present age is satisfied with the simple and
rational opinion, that the islands of Great Britain and Ireland were
gradually peopled from the adjacent continent of Gaul. From the coast of
Kent, to the extremity of Caithness and Ulster, the memory of a Celtic
origin was distinctly preserved, in the perpetual resemblance of
language, of religion, and of manners; and the peculiar characters
of the British tribes might be naturally ascribed to the influence of
accidental and local circumstances. <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> The Roman Province was reduced
to the state of civilized and peaceful servitude; the rights of
savage freedom were contracted to the narrow limits of Caledonia. The
inhabitants of that northern region were divided, as early as the reign
of Constantine, between the two great tribes of the Scots and of the
Picts, <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> who have since experienced a very different fortune. The
power, and almost the memory, of the Picts have been extinguished by
their successful rivals; and the Scots, after maintaining for ages the
dignity of an independent kingdom, have multiplied, by an equal and
voluntary union, the honors of the English name. The hand of nature had
contributed to mark the ancient distinctions of the Scots and Picts. The
former were the men of the hills, and the latter those of the plain.
The eastern coast of Caledonia may be considered as a level and
fertile country, which, even in a rude state of tillage, was capable of
producing a considerable quantity of corn; and the epithet of cruitnich,
or wheat-eaters, expressed the contempt or envy of the carnivorous
highlander. The cultivation of the earth might introduce a more accurate
separation of property, and the habits of a sedentary life; but the love
of arms and rapine was still the ruling passion of the Picts; and
their warriors, who stripped themselves for a day of battle, were
distinguished, in the eyes of the Romans, by the strange fashion of
painting their naked bodies with gaudy colors and fantastic figures. The
western part of Caledonia irregularly rises into wild and barren hills,
which scarcely repay the toil of the husbandman, and are most profitably
used for the pasture of cattle. The highlanders were condemned to the
occupations of shepherds and hunters; and, as they seldom were fixed to
any permanent habitation, they acquired the expressive name of Scots,
which, in the Celtic tongue, is said to be equivalent to that of
wanderers, or vagrants. The inhabitants of a barren land were urged to
seek a fresh supply of food in the waters. The deep lakes and bays which
intersect their country, are plentifully supplied with fish; and they
gradually ventured to cast their nets in the waves of the ocean. The
vicinity of the Hebrides, so profusely scattered along the western coast
of Scotland, tempted their curiosity, and improved their skill; and they
acquired, by slow degrees, the art, or rather the habit, of managing
their boats in a tempestuous sea, and of steering their nocturnal
course by the light of the well-known stars. The two bold headlands of
Caledonia almost touch the shores of a spacious island, which obtained,
from its luxuriant vegetation, the epithet of Green; and has preserved,
with a slight alteration, the name of Erin, or Ierne, or Ireland. It is
probable, that in some remote period of antiquity, the fertile plains of
Ulster received a colony of hungry Scots; and that the strangers of the
North, who had dared to encounter the arms of the legions, spread their
conquests over the savage and unwarlike natives of a solitary island. It
is certain, that, in the declining age of the Roman empire, Caledonia,
Ireland, and the Isle of Man, were inhabited by the Scots, and that the
kindred tribes, who were often associated in military enterprise, were
deeply affected by the various accidents of their mutual fortunes. They
long cherished the lively tradition of their common name and origin;
and the missionaries of the Isle of Saints, who diffused the light of
Christianity over North Britain, established the vain opinion, that
their Irish countrymen were the natural, as well as spiritual, fathers
of the Scottish race. The loose and obscure tradition has been preserved
by the venerable Bede, who scattered some rays of light over the
darkness of the eighth century. On this slight foundation, a huge
superstructure of fable was gradually reared, by the bards and the
monks; two orders of men, who equally abused the privilege of fiction.
The Scottish nation, with mistaken pride, adopted their Irish genealogy;
and the annals of a long line of imaginary kings have been adorned by
the fancy of Boethius, and the classic elegance of Buchanan. <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a>

the Scots of Ammianus Marcellinus (A.D. 340) were already settled in
Caledonia; and that the Roman authors do not afford any hints of their
emigration from another country. 2. That all the accounts of such
emigrations, which have been asserted or received, by Irish bards,
Scotch historians, or English antiquaries, (Buchanan, Camden, Usher,
Stillingfleet, &amp;c.,) are totally fabulous. 3. That three of the Irish
tribes, which are mentioned by Ptolemy, (A.D. 150,) were of Caledonian
extraction. 4. That a younger branch of Caledonian princes, of the house
of Fingal, acquired and possessed the monarchy of Ireland. After these
concessions, the remaining difference between Mr. Whitaker and his
adversaries is minute and obscure. The genuine history, which he
produces, of a Fergus, the cousin of Ossian, who was transplanted (A.D.
320) from Ireland to Caledonia, is built on a conjectural supplement to
the Erse poetry, and the feeble evidence of Richard of Cirencester, a
monk of the fourteenth century. The lively spirit of the learned

have strenuous advocates of the Phoenician origin of the Irish, and each
of the old theories, with several new ones, maintains its partisans. It
would require several pages fairly to bring down the dispute to our own
days, and perhaps we should be no nearer to any satisfactory theory than
Gibbon was.]

<h2>
    Chapter XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The Empire.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>

<p>
Six years after the death of Constantine, the destructive inroads of the
Scots and Picts required the presence of his youngest son, who reigned
in the Western empire. Constans visited his British dominions: but we
may form some estimate of the importance of his achievements, by the
language of panegyric, which celebrates only his triumph over the
elements or, in other words, the good fortune of a safe and easy
passage from the port of Boulogne to the harbor of Sandwich. <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> The
calamities which the afflicted provincials continued to experience,
from foreign war and domestic tyranny, were aggravated by the feeble and
corrupt administration of the eunuchs of Constantius; and the transient
relief which they might obtain from the virtues of Julian, was soon
lost by the absence and death of their benefactor. The sums of gold and
silver, which had been painfully collected, or liberally transmitted,
for the payment of the troops, were intercepted by the avarice of the
commanders; discharges, or, at least, exemptions, from the military
service, were publicly sold; the distress of the soldiers, who were
injuriously deprived of their legal and scanty subsistence, provoked
them to frequent desertion; the nerves of discipline were relaxed, and
the highways were infested with robbers. <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> The oppression of the
good, and the impunity of the wicked, equally contributed to diffuse
through the island a spirit of discontent and revolt; and every
ambitious subject, every desperate exile, might entertain a reasonable
hope of subverting the weak and distracted government of Britain. The
hostile tribes of the North, who detested the pride and power of the
King of the World, suspended their domestic feuds; and the Barbarians
of the land and sea, the Scots, the Picts, and the Saxons, spread
themselves with rapid and irresistible fury, from the wall of Antoninus
to the shores of Kent. Every production of art and nature, every object
of convenience and luxury, which they were incapable of creating by
labor or procuring by trade, was accumulated in the rich and fruitful
province of Britain. <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> A philosopher may deplore the eternal
discords of the human race, but he will confess, that the desire of
spoil is a more rational provocation than the vanity of conquest.
From the age of Constantine to the Plantagenets, this rapacious spirit
continued to instigate the poor and hardy Caledonians; but the same
people, whose generous humanity seems to inspire the songs of Ossian,
was disgraced by a savage ignorance of the virtues of peace, and of
the laws of war. Their southern neighbors have felt, and perhaps
exaggerated, the cruel depredations of the Scots and Picts; <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> and
a valiant tribe of Caledonia, the Attacotti, <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> the enemies, and
afterwards the soldiers, of Valentinian, are accused, by an eye-witness,
of delighting in the taste of human flesh. When they hunted the woods
for prey, it is said, that they attacked the shepherd rather than his
flock; and that they curiously selected the most delicate and brawny
parts, both of males and females, which they prepared for their horrid
repasts. <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> If, in the neighborhood of the commercial and literary
town of Glasgow, a race of cannibals has really existed, we may
contemplate, in the period of the Scottish history, the opposite
extremes of savage and civilized life. Such reflections tend to enlarge
the circle of our ideas; and to encourage the pleasing hope, that
New Zealand may produce, in some future age, the Hume of the Southern
Hemisphere.

agree to the new version, which, in my opinion, is directly contrary
both to the meaning of the words, and the general sense of the passage.
But I would suggest, did Jerom, as a boy, accompany these savages in
any of their hunting expeditions? If he did not, how could he be an
eye-witness of this practice? The Attacotti in Gaul must have been
in the service of Rome. Were they permitted to indulge these cannibal
propensities at the expense, not of the flocks, but of the shepherds of
the provinces? These sanguinary trophies of plunder would scarce'y have
been publicly exhibited in a Roman city or a Roman camp. I must leave

veracity of St. Jerom.]

<p>
Every messenger who escaped across the British Channel, conveyed the
most melancholy and alarming tidings to the ears of Valentinian; and
the emperor was soon informed that the two military commanders of the
province had been surprised and cut off by the Barbarians. Severus,
count of the domestics, was hastily despatched, and as suddenly
recalled, by the court of Treves. The representations of Jovinus served
only to indicate the greatness of the evil; and, after a long and
serious consultation, the defence, or rather the recovery, of Britain
was intrusted to the abilities of the brave Theodosius. The exploits of
that general, the father of a line of emperors, have been celebrated,
with peculiar complacency, by the writers of the age: but his real merit
deserved their applause; and his nomination was received, by the army
and province, as a sure presage of approaching victory. He seized the
favorable moment of navigation, and securely landed the numerous and
veteran bands of the Heruli and Batavians, the Jovians and the Victors.
In his march from Sandwich to London, Theodosius defeated several
parties of the Barbarians, released a multitude of captives, and, after
distributing to his soldiers a small portion of the spoil, established
the fame of disinterested justice, by the restitution of the remainder
to the rightful proprietors. The citizens of London, who had almost
despaired of their safety, threw open their gates; and as soon as
Theodosius had obtained from the court of Treves the important aid of a
military lieutenant, and a civil governor, he executed, with wisdom and
vigor, the laborious task of the deliverance of Britain. The vagrant
soldiers were recalled to their standard; an edict of amnesty dispelled
the public apprehensions; and his cheerful example alleviated the
rigor of martial discipline. The scattered and desultory warfare of the
Barbarians, who infested the land and sea, deprived him of the glory
of a signal victory; but the prudent spirit, and consummate art, of the
Roman general, were displayed in the operations of two campaigns, which
successively rescued every part of the province from the hands of a
cruel and rapacious enemy. The splendor of the cities, and the security
of the fortifications, were diligently restored, by the paternal care of
Theodosius; who with a strong hand confined the trembling Caledonians
to the northern angle of the island; and perpetuated, by the name and
settlement of the new province of Valentia, the glories of the reign of
Valentinian. <a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a> The voice of poetry and panegyric may add, perhaps
with some degree of truth, that the unknown regions of Thule were
stained with the blood of the Picts; that the oars of Theodosius dashed
the waves of the Hyperborean ocean; and that the distant Orkneys were
the scene of his naval victory over the Saxon pirates. <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a> He left
the province with a fair, as well as splendid, reputation; and was
immediately promoted to the rank of master-general of the cavalry, by
a prince who could applaud, without envy, the merit of his servants.
In the important station of the Upper Danube, the conqueror of Britain
checked and defeated the armies of the Alemanni, before he was chosen to
suppress the revolt of Africa.

III. The prince who refuses to be the judge, instructs the people to
consider him as the accomplice, of his ministers. The military command
of Africa had been long exercised by Count Romanus, and his abilities
were not inadequate to his station; but, as sordid interest was the sole
motive of his conduct, he acted, on most occasions, as if he had been
the enemy of the province, and the friend of the Barbarians of the
desert. The three flourishing cities of Oea, Leptis, and Sobrata, which,
under the name of Tripoli, had long constituted a federal union, <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a>
were obliged, for the first time, to shut their gates against a hostile
invasion; several of their most honorable citizens were surprised and
massacred; the villages, and even the suburbs, were pillaged; and the
vines and fruit trees of that rich territory were extirpated by the
malicious savages of Getulia. The unhappy provincials implored the
protection of Romanus; but they soon found that their military governor
was not less cruel and rapacious than the Barbarians. As they were
incapable of furnishing the four thousand camels, and the exorbitant
present, which he required, before he would march to the assistance of
Tripoli; his demand was equivalent to a refusal, and he might justly be
accused as the author of the public calamity. In the annual assembly
of the three cities, they nominated two deputies, to lay at the feet of
Valentinian the customary offering of a gold victory; and to accompany
this tribute of duty, rather than of gratitude, with their humble
complaint, that they were ruined by the enemy, and betrayed by their
governor. If the severity of Valentinian had been rightly directed, it
would have fallen on the guilty head of Romanus. But the count, long
exercised in the arts of corruption, had despatched a swift and trusty
messenger to secure the venal friendship of Remigius, master of the
offices. The wisdom of the Imperial council was deceived by artifice;
and their honest indignation was cooled by delay. At length, when the
repetition of complaint had been justified by the repetition of public
misfortunes, the notary Palladius was sent from the court of Treves,
to examine the state of Africa, and the conduct of Romanus. The rigid
impartiality of Palladius was easily disarmed: he was tempted to reserve
for himself a part of the public treasure, which he brought with him for
the payment of the troops; and from the moment that he was conscious
of his own guilt, he could no longer refuse to attest the innocence and
merit of the count. The charge of the Tripolitans was declared to be
false and frivolous; and Palladius himself was sent back from Treves to
Africa, with a special commission to discover and prosecute the authors
of this impious conspiracy against the representatives of the sovereign.
His inquiries were managed with so much dexterity and success, that he
compelled the citizens of Leptis, who had sustained a recent siege of
eight days, to contradict the truth of their own decrees, and to censure
the behavior of their own deputies. A bloody sentence was pronounced,
without hesitation, by the rash and headstrong cruelty of Valentinian.
The president of Tripoli, who had presumed to pity the distress of the
province, was publicly executed at Utica; four distinguished citizens
were put to death, as the accomplices of the imaginary fraud; and the
tongues of two others were cut out, by the express order of the emperor.
Romanus, elated by impunity, and irritated by resistance, was still
continued in the military command; till the Africans were provoked, by
his avarice, to join the rebellious standard of Firmus, the Moor. <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a>

His father Nabal was one of the richest and most powerful of the Moorish
princes, who acknowledged the supremacy of Rome. But as he left, either
by his wives or concubines, a very numerous posterity, the wealthy
inheritance was eagerly disputed; and Zamma, one of his sons, was slain
in a domestic quarrel by his brother Firmus. The implacable zeal, with
which Romanus prosecuted the legal revenge of this murder, could be
ascribed only to a motive of avarice, or personal hatred; but, on this
occasion, his claims were just; his influence was weighty; and Firmus
clearly understood, that he must either present his neck to the
executioner, or appeal from the sentence of the Imperial consistory, to
his sword, and to the people. <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> He was received as the deliverer
of his country; and, as soon as it appeared that Romanus was formidable
only to a submissive province, the tyrant of Africa became the object of
universal contempt. The ruin of Caesarea, which was plundered and burnt
by the licentious Barbarians, convinced the refractory cities of the
danger of resistance; the power of Firmus was established, at least in
the provinces of Mauritania and Numidia; and it seemed to be his only
doubt whether he should assume the diadem of a Moorish king, or the
purple of a Roman emperor. But the imprudent and unhappy Africans soon
discovered, that, in this rash insurrection, they had not sufficiently
consulted their own strength, or the abilities of their leader. Before
he could procure any certain intelligence, that the emperor of the West
had fixed the choice of a general, or that a fleet of transports was
collected at the mouth of the Rhone, he was suddenly informed that
the great Theodosius, with a small band of veterans, had landed near
Igilgilis, or Gigeri, on the African coast; and the timid usurper
sunk under the ascendant of virtue and military genius. Though Firmus
possessed arms and treasures, his despair of victory immediately reduced
him to the use of those arts, which, in the same country, and in a
similar situation, had formerly been practised by the crafty Jugurtha.
He attempted to deceive, by an apparent submission, the vigilance of the
Roman general; to seduce the fidelity of his troops; and to protract the
duration of the war, by successively engaging the independent tribes
of Africa to espouse his quarrel, or to protect his flight. Theodosius
imitated the example, and obtained the success, of his predecessor
Metellus. When Firmus, in the character of a suppliant, accused his
own rashness, and humbly solicited the clemency of the emperor, the
lieutenant of Valentinian received and dismissed him with a friendly
embrace: but he diligently required the useful and substantial pledges
of a sincere repentance; nor could he be persuaded, by the assurances
of peace, to suspend, for an instant, the operations of an active war.
A dark conspiracy was detected by the penetration of Theodosius; and he
satisfied, without much reluctance, the public indignation, which he
had secretly excited. Several of the guilty accomplices of Firmus were
abandoned, according to ancient custom, to the tumult of a military
execution; many more, by the amputation of both their hands, continued
to exhibit an instructive spectacle of horror; the hatred of the rebels
was accompanied with fear; and the fear of the Roman soldiers was
mingled with respectful admiration. Amidst the boundless plains of
Getulia, and the innumerable valleys of Mount Atlas, it was impossible
to prevent the escape of Firmus; and if the usurper could have tired
the patience of his antagonist, he would have secured his person in
the depth of some remote solitude, and expected the hopes of a future
revolution. He was subdued by the perseverance of Theodosius; who had
formed an inflexible determination, that the war should end only by the
death of the tyrant; and that every nation of Africa, which presumed
to support his cause, should be involved in his ruin. At the head of a
small body of troops, which seldom exceeded three thousand five hundred
men, the Roman general advanced, with a steady prudence, devoid of
rashness or of fear, into the heart of a country, where he was sometimes
attacked by armies of twenty thousand Moors. The boldness of his
charge dismayed the irregular Barbarians; they were disconcerted by his
seasonable and orderly retreats; they were continually baffled by the
unknown resources of the military art; and they felt and confessed the
just superiority which was assumed by the leader of a civilized nation.
When Theodosius entered the extensive dominions of Igmazen, king of the
Isaflenses, the haughty savage required, in words of defiance, his
name, and the object of his expedition. "I am," replied the stern and
disdainful count, "I am the general of Valentinian, the lord of the
world; who has sent me hither to pursue and punish a desperate robber.
Deliver him instantly into my hands; and be assured, that if thou dost
not obey the commands of my invincible sovereign, thou, and the people
over whom thou reignest, shall be utterly extirpated." <a href="#note-12211" name="noteref-12211"><small>12211</small></a> As soon
as Igmazen was satisfied, that his enemy had strength and resolution to
execute the fatal menace, he consented to purchase a necessary peace
by the sacrifice of a guilty fugitive. The guards that were placed to
secure the person of Firmus deprived him of the hopes of escape; and
the Moorish tyrant, after wine had extinguished the sense of danger,
disappointed the insulting triumph of the Romans, by strangling himself
in the night. His dead body, the only present which Igmazen could offer
to the conqueror, was carelessly thrown upon a camel; and Theodosius,
leading back his victorious troops to Sitifi, was saluted by the warmest
acclamations of joy and loyalty. <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a>

Africa had been lost by the vices of Romanus; it was restored by the
virtues of Theodosius; and our curiosity may be usefully directed to the
inquiry of the respective treatment which the two generals received from
the Imperial court. The authority of Count Romanus had been suspended
by the master-general of the cavalry; and he was committed to safe and
honorable custody till the end of the war. His crimes were proved by the
most authentic evidence; and the public expected, with some impatience,
the decree of severe justice. But the partial and powerful favor of
Mellobaudes encouraged him to challenge his legal judges, to obtain
repeated delays for the purpose of procuring a crowd of friendly
witnesses, and, finally, to cover his guilty conduct, by the additional
guilt of fraud and forgery. About the same time, the restorer of
Britain and Africa, on a vague suspicion that his name and services
were superior to the rank of a subject, was ignominiously beheaded at
Carthage. Valentinian no longer reigned; and the death of Theodosius,
as well as the impunity of Romanus, may justly be imputed to the arts of
the ministers, who abused the confidence, and deceived the inexperienced
youth, of his sons. <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a>

<p>
If the geographical accuracy of Ammianus had been fortunately bestowed
on the British exploits of Theodosius, we should have traced, with eager
curiosity, the distinct and domestic footsteps of his march. But the
tedious enumeration of the unknown and uninteresting tribes of Africa
may be reduced to the general remark, that they were all of the swarthy
race of the Moors; that they inhabited the back settlements of the
Mauritanian and Numidian province, the country, as they have since been
termed by the Arabs, of dates and of locusts; <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a> and that, as the
Roman power declined in Africa, the boundary of civilized manners and
cultivated land was insensibly contracted. Beyond the utmost limits of
the Moors, the vast and inhospitable desert of the South extends above
a thousand miles to the banks of the Niger. The ancients, who had a very
faint and imperfect knowledge of the great peninsula of Africa, were
sometimes tempted to believe, that the torrid zone must ever remain
destitute of inhabitants; <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> and they sometimes amused their fancy
by filling the vacant space with headless men, or rather monsters; <a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a>
with horned and cloven-footed satyrs; <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> with fabulous centaurs;
<a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a> and with human pygmies, who waged a bold and doubtful warfare
against the cranes. <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> Carthage would have trembled at the strange
intelligence that the countries on either side of the equator were
filled with innumerable nations, who differed only in their color from
the ordinary appearance of the human species: and the subjects of
the Roman empire might have anxiously expected, that the swarms of
Barbarians, which issued from the North, would soon be encountered
from the South by new swarms of Barbarians, equally fierce and equally
formidable. These gloomy terrors would indeed have been dispelled by a
more intimate acquaintance with the character of their African enemies.
The inaction of the negroes does not seem to be the effect either of
their virtue or of their pusillanimity. They indulge, like the rest
of mankind, their passions and appetites; and the adjacent tribes are
engaged in frequent acts of hostility. <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a> But their rude ignorance
has never invented any effectual weapons of defence, or of destruction;
they appear incapable of forming any extensive plans of government, or
conquest; and the obvious inferiority of their mental faculties has
been discovered and abused by the nations of the temperate zone. Sixty
thousand blacks are annually embarked from the coast of Guinea, never to
return to their native country; but they are embarked in chains; <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a>
and this constant emigration, which, in the space of two centuries,
might have furnished armies to overrun the globe, accuses the guilt of
Europe, and the weakness of Africa.

<h2>
    Chapter XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The Empire.&mdash;Part VI.
</h2>

<p>
IV. The ignominious treaty, which saved the army of Jovian, had been
faithfully executed on the side of the Romans; and as they had solemnly
renounced the sovereignty and alliance of Armenia and Iberia, those
tributary kingdoms were exposed, without protection, to the arms of the
Persian monarch. <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> Sapor entered the Armenian territories at the
head of a formidable host of cuirassiers, of archers, and of mercenary
foot; but it was the invariable practice of Sapor to mix war and
negotiation, and to consider falsehood and perjury as the most powerful
instruments of regal policy. He affected to praise the prudent and
moderate conduct of the king of Armenia; and the unsuspicious Tiranus
was persuaded, by the repeated assurances of insidious friendship, to
deliver his person into the hands of a faithless and cruel enemy. In the
midst of a splendid entertainment, he was bound in chains of silver,
as an honor due to the blood of the Arsacides; and, after a short
confinement in the Tower of Oblivion at Ecbatana, he was released
from the miseries of life, either by his own dagger, or by that of an
assassin. <a href="#note-13311" name="noteref-13311"><small>13311</small></a> The kingdom of Armenia was reduced to the state of a
Persian province; the administration was shared between a distinguished
satrap and a favorite eunuch; and Sapor marched, without delay, to
subdue the martial spirit of the Iberians. Sauromaces, who reigned
in that country by the permission of the emperors, was expelled by a
superior force; and, as an insult on the majesty of Rome, the king of
kings placed a diadem on the head of his abject vassal Aspacuras. The
city of Artogerassa <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a> was the only place of Armenia <a href="#note-13411" name="noteref-13411"><small>13411</small></a> which
presumed to resist the efforts of his arms. The treasure deposited in
that strong fortress tempted the avarice of Sapor; but the danger of
Olympias, the wife or widow of the Armenian king, excited the public
compassion, and animated the desperate valor of her subjects and
soldiers. <a href="#note-13412" name="noteref-13412"><small>13412</small></a> The Persians were surprised and repulsed under
the walls of Artogerassa, by a bold and well-concerted sally of
the besieged. But the forces of Sapor were continually renewed and
increased; the hopeless courage of the garrison was exhausted; the
strength of the walls yielded to the assault; and the proud conqueror,
after wasting the rebellious city with fire and sword, led away captive
an unfortunate queen; who, in a more auspicious hour, had been the
destined bride of the son of Constantine. <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a> Yet if Sapor already
triumphed in the easy conquest of two dependent kingdoms, he soon felt,
that a country is unsubdued as long as the minds of the people are
actuated by a hostile and contumacious spirit. The satraps, whom he
was obliged to trust, embraced the first opportunity of regaining the
affection of their countrymen, and of signalizing their immortal hatred
to the Persian name. Since the conversion of the Armenians and Iberians,
these nations considered the Christians as the favorites, and the
Magians as the adversaries, of the Supreme Being: the influence of the
clergy, over a superstitious people was uniformly exerted in the cause
of Rome; and as long as the successors of Constantine disputed with
those of Artaxerxes the sovereignty of the intermediate provinces, the
religious connection always threw a decisive advantage into the scale
of the empire. A numerous and active party acknowledged Para, the son of
Tiranus, as the lawful sovereign of Armenia, and his title to the throne
was deeply rooted in the hereditary succession of five hundred years. By
the unanimous consent of the Iberians, the country was equally divided
between the rival princes; and Aspacuras, who owed his diadem to
the choice of Sapor, was obliged to declare, that his regard for his
children, who were detained as hostages by the tyrant, was the only
consideration which prevented him from openly renouncing the alliance of
Persia. The emperor Valens, who respected the obligations of the treaty,
and who was apprehensive of involving the East in a dangerous war,
ventured, with slow and cautious measures, to support the Roman party
in the kingdoms of Iberia and Armenia. <a href="#note-13511" name="noteref-13511"><small>13511</small></a> Twelve legions established
the authority of Sauromaces on the banks of the Cyrus. The Euphrates was
protected by the valor of Arintheus. A powerful army, under the command
of Count Trajan, and of Vadomair, king of the Alemanni, fixed their
camp on the confines of Armenia. But they were strictly enjoined not to
commit the first hostilities, which might be understood as a breach of
the treaty: and such was the implicit obedience of the Roman general,
that they retreated, with exemplary patience, under a shower of Persian
arrows till they had clearly acquired a just title to an honorable and
legitimate victory. Yet these appearances of war insensibly subsided in
a vain and tedious negotiation. The contending parties supported their
claims by mutual reproaches of perfidy and ambition; and it should seem,
that the original treaty was expressed in very obscure terms, since they
were reduced to the necessity of making their inconclusive appeal to the
partial testimony of the generals of the two nations, who had assisted
at the negotiations. <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a> The invasion of the Goths and Huns which
soon afterwards shook the foundations of the Roman empire, exposed
the provinces of Asia to the arms of Sapor. But the declining age,
and perhaps the infirmities, of the monarch suggested new maxims of
tranquillity and moderation. His death, which happened in the full
maturity of a reign of seventy years, changed in a moment the court and
councils of Persia; and their attention was most probably engaged by
domestic troubles, and the distant efforts of a Carmanian war. <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a> The
remembrance of ancient injuries was lost in the enjoyment of peace.
The kingdoms of Armenia and Iberia were permitted, by the mutual,though
tacit consent of both empires, to resume their doubtful neutrality. In
the first years of the reign of Theodosius, a Persian embassy arrived
at Constantinople, to excuse the unjustifiable measures of the former
reign; and to offer, as the tribute of friendship, or even of respect, a
splendid present of gems, of silk, and of Indian elephants. <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a>

<p>
In the general picture of the affairs of the East under the reign
of Valens, the adventures of Para form one of the most striking and
singular objects. The noble youth, by the persuasion of his mother
Olympias, had escaped through the Persian host that besieged
Artogerassa, and implored the protection of the emperor of the East. By
his timid councils, Para was alternately supported, and recalled, and
restored, and betrayed. The hopes of the Armenians were sometimes raised
by the presence of their natural sovereign, <a href="#note-13811" name="noteref-13811"><small>13811</small></a> and the ministers of
Valens were satisfied, that they preserved the integrity of the public
faith, if their vassal was not suffered to assume the diadem and
title of King. But they soon repented of their own rashness. They were
confounded by the reproaches and threats of the Persian monarch.
They found reason to distrust the cruel and inconstant temper of Para
himself; who sacrificed, to the slightest suspicions, the lives of his
most faithful servants, and held a secret and disgraceful correspondence
with the assassin of his father and the enemy of his country. Under the
specious pretence of consulting with the emperor on the subject of their
common interest, Para was persuaded to descend from the mountains of
Armenia, where his party was in arms, and to trust his independence and
safety to the discretion of a perfidious court. The king of Armenia,
for such he appeared in his own eyes and in those of his nation, was
received with due honors by the governors of the provinces through which
he passed; but when he arrived at Tarsus in Cilicia, his progress
was stopped under various pretences; his motions were watched with
respectful vigilance, and he gradually discovered, that he was a
prisoner in the hands of the Romans. Para suppressed his indignation,
dissembled his fears, and after secretly preparing his escape, mounted
on horseback with three hundred of his faithful followers. The officer
stationed at the door of his apartment immediately communicated his
flight to the consular of Cilicia, who overtook him in the suburbs, and
endeavored without success, to dissuade him from prosecuting his rash
and dangerous design. A legion was ordered to pursue the royal fugitive;
but the pursuit of infantry could not be very alarming to a body of
light cavalry; and upon the first cloud of arrows that was discharged
into the air, they retreated with precipitation to the gates of Tarsus.
After an incessant march of two days and two nights, Para and his
Armenians reached the banks of the Euphrates; but the passage of the
river which they were obliged to swim, <a href="#note-13812" name="noteref-13812"><small>13812</small></a> was attended with some
delay and some loss. The country was alarmed; and the two roads, which
were only separated by an interval of three miles had been occupied by
a thousand archers on horseback, under the command of a count and a
tribune. Para must have yielded to superior force, if the accidental
arrival of a friendly traveller had not revealed the danger and the
means of escape. A dark and almost impervious path securely conveyed
the Armenian troop through the thicket; and Para had left behind him the
count and the tribune, while they patiently expected his approach along
the public highways. They returned to the Imperial court to excuse their
want of diligence or success; and seriously alleged, that the king of
Armenia, who was a skilful magician, had transformed himself and his
followers, and passed before their eyes under a borrowed shape. 
<a href="#note-13813" name="noteref-13813"><small>13813</small></a>
After his return to his native kingdom, Para still continued to profess
himself the friend and ally of the Romans: but the Romans had injured
him too deeply ever to forgive, and the secret sentence of his death was
signed in the council of Valens. The execution of the bloody deed was
committed to the subtle prudence of Count Trajan; and he had the merit
of insinuating himself into the confidence of the credulous prince,
that he might find an opportunity of stabbing him to the heart Para was
invited to a Roman banquet, which had been prepared with all the pomp
and sensuality of the East; the hall resounded with cheerful music, and
the company was already heated with wine; when the count retired for an

desperate Barbarian instantly rushed on the king of Armenia; and though
he bravely defended his life with the first weapon that chance offered
to his hand, the table of the Imperial general was stained with the
royal blood of a guest, and an ally. Such were the weak and wicked
maxims of the Roman administration, that, to attain a doubtful object
of political interest the laws of nations, and the sacred rights of
hospitality were inhumanly violated in the face of the world. <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a>

V. During a peaceful interval of thirty years, the Romans secured their
frontiers, and the Goths extended their dominions. The victories of the
great Hermanric, <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a> king of the Ostrogoths, and the most noble of
the race of the Amali, have been compared, by the enthusiasm of his
countrymen, to the exploits of Alexander; with this singular, and almost
incredible, difference, that the martial spirit of the Gothic hero,
instead of being supported by the vigor of youth, was displayed with
glory and success in the extreme period of human life, between the age
of fourscore and one hundred and ten years. The independent tribes were
persuaded, or compelled, to acknowledge the king of the Ostrogoths as
the sovereign of the Gothic nation: the chiefs of the Visigoths, or
Thervingi, renounced the royal title, and assumed the more humble
appellation of Judges; and, among those judges, Athanaric, Fritigern,
and Alavivus, were the most illustrious, by their personal merit,
as well as by their vicinity to the Roman provinces. These domestic
conquests, which increased the military power of Hermanric, enlarged his
ambitious designs. He invaded the adjacent countries of the North; and
twelve considerable nations, whose names and limits cannot be accurately
defined, successively yielded to the superiority of the Gothic arms
<a href="#note-141" name="noteref-141"><small>141</small></a> The Heruli, who inhabited the marshy lands near the lake Maeotis,
were renowned for their strength and agility; and the assistance of
their light infantry was eagerly solicited, and highly esteemed, in
all the wars of the Barbarians. But the active spirit of the Heruli was
subdued by the slow and steady perseverance of the Goths; and, after a
bloody action, in which the king was slain, the remains of that warlike
tribe became a useful accession to the camp of Hermanric.
</p>
<p>
He then marched against the Venedi; unskilled in the use of arms, and
formidable only by their numbers, which filled the wide extent of the
plains of modern Poland. The victorious Goths, who were not inferior
in numbers, prevailed in the contest, by the decisive advantages
of exercise and discipline. After the submission of the Venedi, the
conqueror advanced, without resistance, as far as the confines of the
Aestii; <a href="#note-142" name="noteref-142"><small>142</small></a> an ancient people, whose name is still preserved in the
province of Esthonia. Those distant inhabitants of the Baltic coast were
supported by the labors of agriculture, enriched by the trade of amber,
and consecrated by the peculiar worship of the Mother of the Gods. But
the scarcity of iron obliged the Aestian warriors to content themselves
with wooden clubs; and the reduction of that wealthy country is ascribed
to the prudence, rather than to the arms, of Hermanric. His dominions,
which extended from the Danube to the Baltic, included the native seats,
and the recent acquisitions, of the Goths; and he reigned over the
greatest part of Germany and Scythia with the authority of a conqueror,
and sometimes with the cruelty of a tyrant. But he reigned over a part
of the globe incapable of perpetuating and adorning the glory of its
heroes. The name of Hermanric is almost buried in oblivion; his exploits
are imperfectly known; and the Romans themselves appeared unconscious
of the progress of an aspiring power which threatened the liberty of the
North, and the peace of the empire. <a href="#note-143" name="noteref-143"><small>143</small></a>

The Goths had contracted an hereditary attachment for the Imperial house
of Constantine, of whose power and liberality they had received so many
signal proofs. They respected the public peace; and if a hostile band
sometimes presumed to pass the Roman limit, their irregular conduct was
candidly ascribed to the ungovernable spirit of the Barbarian youth.
Their contempt for two new and obscure princes, who had been raised to
the throne by a popular election, inspired the Goths with bolder hopes;
and, while they agitated some design of marching their confederate force
under the national standard, <a href="#note-144" name="noteref-144"><small>144</small></a> they were easily tempted to embrace
the party of Procopius; and to foment, by their dangerous aid, the civil
discord of the Romans. The public treaty might stipulate no more than
ten thousand auxiliaries; but the design was so zealously adopted by the
chiefs of the Visigoths, that the army which passed the Danube amounted
to the number of thirty thousand men. <a href="#note-145" name="noteref-145"><small>145</small></a> They marched with the proud
confidence, that their invincible valor would decide the fate of the
Roman empire; and the provinces of Thrace groaned under the weight
of the Barbarians, who displayed the insolence of masters and the
licentiousness of enemies. But the intemperance which gratified their
appetites, retarded their progress; and before the Goths could receive
any certain intelligence of the defeat and death of Procopius, they
perceived, by the hostile state of the country, that the civil and
military powers were resumed by his successful rival. A chain of posts
and fortifications, skilfully disposed by Valens, or the generals of
Valens, resisted their march, prevented their retreat, and intercepted
their subsistence. The fierceness of the Barbarians was tamed and
suspended by hunger; they indignantly threw down their arms at the
feet of the conqueror, who offered them food and chains: the numerous
captives were distributed in all the cities of the East; and the
provincials, who were soon familiarized with their savage appearance,
ventured, by degrees, to measure their own strength with these
formidable adversaries, whose name had so long been the object of their
terror. The king of Scythia (and Hermanric alone could deserve so lofty
a title) was grieved and exasperated by this national calamity. His
ambassadors loudly complained, at the court of Valens, of the infraction
of the ancient and solemn alliance, which had so long subsisted between
the Romans and the Goths. They alleged, that they had fulfilled the duty
of allies, by assisting the kinsman and successor of the emperor Julian;
they required the immediate restitution of the noble captives; and they
urged a very singular claim, that the Gothic generals marching in
arms, and in hostile array, were entitled to the sacred character and
privileges of ambassadors. The decent, but peremptory, refusal of
these extravagant demands, was signified to the Barbarians by Victor,
master-general of the cavalry; who expressed, with force and dignity,
the just complaints of the emperor of the East. <a href="#note-146" name="noteref-146"><small>146</small></a> The negotiation
was interrupted; and the manly exhortations of Valentinian encouraged

<p>
The splendor and magnitude of this Gothic war are celebrated by a
contemporary historian: <a href="#note-148" name="noteref-148"><small>148</small></a> but the events scarcely deserve the
attention of posterity, except as the preliminary steps of the
approaching decline and fall of the empire. Instead of leading the
nations of Germany and Scythia to the banks of the Danube, or even to
the gates of Constantinople, the aged monarch of the Goths resigned to
the brave Athanaric the danger and glory of a defensive war, against an
enemy, who wielded with a feeble hand the powers of a mighty state. A
bridge of boats was established upon the Danube; the presence of Valens
animated his troops; and his ignorance of the art of war was compensated
by personal bravery, and a wise deference to the advice of Victor
and Arintheus, his masters-general of the cavalry and infantry. The
operations of the campaign were conducted by their skill and experience;
but they found it impossible to drive the Visigoths from their strong
posts in the mountains; and the devastation of the plains obliged the
Romans themselves to repass the Danube on the approach of winter. The
incessant rains, which swelled the waters of the river, produced a tacit
suspension of arms, and confined the emperor Valens, during the whole
course of the ensuing summer, to his camp of Marcianopolis. The third
year of the war was more favorable to the Romans, and more pernicious
to the Goths. The interruption of trade deprived the Barbarians of the
objects of luxury, which they already confounded with the necessaries of
life; and the desolation of a very extensive tract of country threatened
them with the horrors of famine. Athanaric was provoked, or compelled,
to risk a battle, which he lost, in the plains; and the pursuit was
rendered more bloody by the cruel precaution of the victorious generals,
who had promised a large reward for the head of every Goth that was
brought into the Imperial camp. The submission of the Barbarians
appeased the resentment of Valens and his council: the emperor listened
with satisfaction to the flattering and eloquent remonstrance of the
senate of Constantinople, which assumed, for the first time, a share in
the public deliberations; and the same generals, Victor and Arintheus,
who had successfully directed the conduct of the war, were empowered to
regulate the conditions of peace. The freedom of trade, which the Goths
had hitherto enjoyed, was restricted to two cities on the Danube; the
rashness of their leaders was severely punished by the suppression of
their pensions and subsidies; and the exception, which was stipulated
in favor of Athanaric alone, was more advantageous than honorable to
the Judge of the Visigoths. Athanaric, who, on this occasion, appears to
have consulted his private interest, without expecting the orders of
his sovereign, supported his own dignity, and that of his tribe, in the
personal interview which was proposed by the ministers of Valens. He
persisted in his declaration, that it was impossible for him, without
incurring the guilt of perjury, ever to set his foot on the territory
of the empire; and it is more than probable, that his regard for the
sanctity of an oath was confirmed by the recent and fatal examples of
Roman treachery. The Danube, which separated the dominions of the two
independent nations, was chosen for the scene of the conference. The
emperor of the East, and the Judge of the Visigoths, accompanied by an
equal number of armed followers, advanced in their respective barges to
the middle of the stream. After the ratification of the treaty, and the
delivery of hostages, Valens returned in triumph to Constantinople; and
the Goths remained in a state of tranquillity about six years; till they
were violently impelled against the Roman empire by an innumerable
host of Scythians, who appeared to issue from the frozen regions of the
North. <a href="#note-149" name="noteref-149"><small>149</small></a>

<p>
The emperor of the West, who had resigned to his brother the command
of the Lower Danube, reserved for his immediate care the defence of
the Rhaetian and Illyrian provinces, which spread so many hundred
miles along the greatest of the European rivers. The active policy of
Valentinian was continually employed in adding new fortifications to the
security of the frontier: but the abuse of this policy provoked the just
resentment of the Barbarians. The Quadi complained, that the ground for
an intended fortress had been marked out on their territories; and their
complaints were urged with so much reason and moderation, that Equitius,
master-general of Illyricum, consented to suspend the prosecution of
the work, till he should be more clearly informed of the will of his
sovereign. This fair occasion of injuring a rival, and of advancing the
fortune of his son, was eagerly embraced by the inhuman Maximin, the
praefect, or rather tyrant, of Gaul. The passions of Valentinian were
impatient of control; and he credulously listened to the assurances of
his favorite, that if the government of Valeria, and the direction of
the work, were intrusted to the zeal of his son Marcellinus, the emperor
should no longer be importuned with the audacious remonstrances of
the Barbarians. The subjects of Rome, and the natives of Germany,
were insulted by the arrogance of a young and worthless minister, who
considered his rapid elevation as the proof and reward of his superior
merit. He affected, however, to receive the modest application of
Gabinius, king of the Quadi, with some attention and regard: but this
artful civility concealed a dark and bloody design, and the credulous
prince was persuaded to accept the pressing invitation of Marcellinus.
I am at a loss how to vary the narrative of similar crimes; or how to
relate, that, in the course of the same year, but in remote parts of the
empire, the inhospitable table of two Imperial generals was stained with
the royal blood of two guests and allies, inhumanly murdered by their
order, and in their presence. The fate of Gabinius, and of Para, was
the same: but the cruel death of their sovereign was resented in a very
different manner by the servile temper of the Armenians, and the free
and daring spirit of the Germans. The Quadi were much declined from that
formidable power, which, in the time of Marcus Antoninus, had spread
terror to the gates of Rome. But they still possessed arms and courage;
their courage was animated by despair, and they obtained the usual
reenforcement of the cavalry of their Sarmatian allies. So improvident
was the assassin Marcellinus, that he chose the moment when the bravest
veterans had been drawn away, to suppress the revolt of Firmus; and the
whole province was exposed, with a very feeble defence, to the rage
of the exasperated Barbarians. They invaded Pannonia in the season of
harvest; unmercifully destroyed every object of plunder which they could
not easily transport; and either disregarded, or demolished, the empty
fortifications. The princess Constantia, the daughter of the emperor
Constantius, and the granddaughter of the great Constantine, very
narrowly escaped. That royal maid, who had innocently supported the
revolt of Procopius, was now the destined wife of the heir of the
Western empire. She traversed the peaceful province with a splendid and
unarmed train. Her person was saved from danger, and the republic from
disgrace, by the active zeal of Messala, governor of the provinces.
As soon as he was informed that the village, where she stopped only to
dine, was almost encompassed by the Barbarians, he hastily placed her
in his own chariot, and drove full speed till he reached the gates
of Sirmium, which were at the distance of six-and-twenty miles. Even
Sirmium might not have been secure, if the Quadi and Sarmatians had
diligently advanced during the general consternation of the magistrates
and people. Their delay allowed Probus, the Praetorian praefect,
sufficient time to recover his own spirits, and to revive the courage
of the citizens. He skilfully directed their strenuous efforts to repair
and strengthen the decayed fortifications; and procured the seasonable
and effectual assistance of a company of archers, to protect the capital
of the Illyrian provinces. Disappointed in their attempts against the
walls of Sirmium, the indignant Barbarians turned their arms against
the master general of the frontier, to whom they unjustly attributed the
murder of their king. Equitius could bring into the field no more than
two legions; but they contained the veteran strength of the Maesian and
Pannonian bands. The obstinacy with which they disputed the vain honors
of rank and precedency, was the cause of their destruction; and
while they acted with separate forces and divided councils, they were
surprised and slaughtered by the active vigor of the Sarmatian horse.
The success of this invasion provoked the emulation of the bordering
tribes; and the province of Maesia would infallibly have been lost, if
young Theodosius, the duke, or military commander, of the frontier, had
not signalized, in the defeat of the public enemy, an intrepid genius,
worthy of his illustrious father, and of his future greatness. <a href="#note-150" name="noteref-150"><small>150</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXV: Reigns Of Jovian And Valentinian, Division Of The Empire.&mdash;Part VII.
</h2>

<p>
The mind of Valentinian, who then resided at Treves, was deeply affected
by the calamities of Illyricum; but the lateness of the season suspended
the execution of his designs till the ensuing spring. He marched in
person, with a considerable part of the forces of Gaul, from the banks
of the Moselle: and to the suppliant ambassadors of the Sarmatians, who
met him on the way, he returned a doubtful answer, that, as soon as he
reached the scene of action, he should examine, and pronounce. When he
arrived at Sirmium, he gave audience to the deputies of the Illyrian
provinces; who loudly congratulated their own felicity under the
auspicious government of Probus, his Praetorian praefect. <a href="#note-151" name="noteref-151"><small>151</small></a>
Valentinian, who was flattered by these demonstrations of their
loyalty and gratitude, imprudently asked the deputy of Epirus, a Cynic
philosopher of intrepid sincerity, <a href="#note-152" name="noteref-152"><small>152</small></a> whether he was freely sent by
the wishes of the province. "With tears and groans am I sent," replied
Iphicles, "by a reluctant people." The emperor paused: but the impunity
of his ministers established the pernicious maxim, that they might
oppress his subjects, without injuring his service. A strict inquiry
into their conduct would have relieved the public discontent. The severe
condemnation of the murder of Gabinius, was the only measure which could
restore the confidence of the Germans, and vindicate the honor of the
Roman name. But the haughty monarch was incapable of the magnanimity
which dares to acknowledge a fault. He forgot the provocation,
remembered only the injury, and advanced into the country of the Quadi
with an insatiate thirst of blood and revenge. The extreme devastation,
and promiscuous massacre, of a savage war, were justified, in the eyes
of the emperor, and perhaps in those of the world, by the cruel equity
of retaliation: <a href="#note-153" name="noteref-153"><small>153</small></a> and such was the discipline of the Romans, and the
consternation of the enemy, that Valentinian repassed the Danube without
the loss of a single man. As he had resolved to complete the destruction
of the Quadi by a second campaign, he fixed his winter quarters at
Bregetio, on the Danube, near the Hungarian city of Presburg. While the
operations of war were suspended by the severity of the weather, the
Quadi made an humble attempt to deprecate the wrath of their conqueror;
and, at the earnest persuasion of Equitius, their ambassadors were
introduced into the Imperial council. They approached the throne with
bended bodies and dejected countenances; and without daring to complain
of the murder of their king, they affirmed, with solemn oaths, that the
late invasion was the crime of some irregular robbers, which the public
council of the nation condemned and abhorred. The answer of the emperor
left them but little to hope from his clemency or compassion. He
reviled, in the most intemperate language, their baseness, their
ingratitude, their insolence. His eyes, his voice, his color, his
gestures, expressed the violence of his ungoverned fury; and while his
whole frame was agitated with convulsive passion, a large blood vessel
suddenly burst in his body; and Valentinian fell speechless into the
arms of his attendants. Their pious care immediately concealed his
situation from the crowd; but, in a few minutes, the emperor of the West
expired in an agony of pain, retaining his senses till the last; and
struggling, without success, to declare his intentions to the generals
and ministers, who surrounded the royal couch. Valentinian was about
fifty-four years of age; and he wanted only one hundred days to
accomplish the twelve years of his reign. <a href="#note-154" name="noteref-154"><small>154</small></a>

<p>
The polygamy of Valentinian is seriously attested by an ecclesiastical
historian. <a href="#note-155" name="noteref-155"><small>155</small></a> "The empress Severa (I relate the fable) admitted into
her familiar society the lovely Justina, the daughter of an Italian
governor: her admiration of those naked charms, which she had often seen
in the bath, was expressed with such lavish and imprudent praise, that
the emperor was tempted to introduce a second wife into his bed; and
his public edict extended to all the subjects of the empire the same
domestic privilege which he had assumed for himself." But we may be
assured, from the evidence of reason as well as history, that the
two marriages of Valentinian, with Severa, and with Justina, were
successively contracted; and that he used the ancient permission of
divorce, which was still allowed by the laws, though it was condemned by
the church Severa was the mother of Gratian, who seemed to unite every
claim which could entitle him to the undoubted succession of the Western
empire. He was the eldest son of a monarch whose glorious reign had
confirmed the free and honorable choice of his fellow-soldiers. Before
he had attained the ninth year of his age, the royal youth received from
the hands of his indulgent father the purple robe and diadem, with the
title of Augustus; the election was solemnly ratified by the consent and
applause of the armies of Gaul; <a href="#note-156" name="noteref-156"><small>156</small></a> and the name of Gratian was added
to the names of Valentinian and Valens, in all the legal transactions
of the Roman government. By his marriage with the granddaughter of
Constantine, the son of Valentinian acquired all the hereditary rights
of the Flavian family; which, in a series of three Imperial generations,
were sanctified by time, religion, and the reverence of the people. At
the death of his father, the royal youth was in the seventeenth year of
his age; and his virtues already justified the favorable opinion of the
army and the people. But Gratian resided, without apprehension, in
the palace of Treves; whilst, at the distance of many hundred miles,
Valentinian suddenly expired in the camp of Bregetio. The passions,
which had been so long suppressed by the presence of a master,
immediately revived in the Imperial council; and the ambitious design of
reigning in the name of an infant, was artfully executed by Mellobaudes
and Equitius, who commanded the attachment of the Illyrian and Italian
bands. They contrived the most honorable pretences to remove the popular
leaders, and the troops of Gaul, who might have asserted the claims of
the lawful successor; they suggested the necessity of extinguishing the
hopes of foreign and domestic enemies, by a bold and decisive measure.
The empress Justina, who had been left in a palace about one hundred
miles from Bregetio, was respectively invited to appear in the camp,
with the son of the deceased emperor. On the sixth day after the death
of Valentinian, the infant prince of the same name, who was only four
years old, was shown, in the arms of his mother, to the legions; and
solemnly invested, by military acclamation, with the titles and ensigns
of supreme power. The impending dangers of a civil war were seasonably
prevented by the wise and moderate conduct of the emperor Gratian. He
cheerfully accepted the choice of the army; declared that he should
always consider the son of Justina as a brother, not as a rival; and
advised the empress, with her son Valentinian to fix their residence at
Milan, in the fair and peaceful province of Italy; while he assumed
the more arduous command of the countries beyond the Alps. Gratian
dissembled his resentment till he could safely punish, or disgrace,
the authors of the conspiracy; and though he uniformly behaved with
tenderness and regard to his infant colleague, he gradually confounded,
in the administration of the Western empire, the office of a guardian
with the authority of a sovereign. The government of the Roman world
was exercised in the united names of Valens and his two nephews; but
the feeble emperor of the East, who succeeded to the rank of his elder
brother, never obtained any weight or influence in the councils of the
West. <a href="#note-157" name="noteref-157"><small>157</small></a>

[ Socrates (l. iv. c. 31) is the only original witness of
this foolish story, so repugnant to the laws and manners of the Romans,
that it scarcely deserved the formal and elaborate dissertation of M.
Bonamy, (Mem. de l'Academie, tom. xxx. p. 394-405.) Yet I would preserve
the natural circumstance of the bath; instead of following Zosimus who
represents Justina as an old woman, the widow of Magnentius.]

has proved (Hist. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 707-709) that Gratian
reignea in Italy, Africa, and Illyricum. I have endeavored to express
his authority over his brother's dominions, as he used it, in an
ambiguous style.]
