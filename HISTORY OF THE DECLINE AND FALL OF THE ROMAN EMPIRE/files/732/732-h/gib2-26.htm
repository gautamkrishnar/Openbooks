<p>
In the second year of the reign of Valentinian and Valens, on the
morning of the twenty-first day of July, the greatest part of the Roman
world was shaken by a violent and destructive earthquake. The impression
was communicated to the waters; the shores of the Mediterranean were
left dry, by the sudden retreat of the sea; great quantities of fish
were caught with the hand; large vessels were stranded on the mud; and
a curious spectator <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> amused his eye, or rather his fancy, by
contemplating the various appearance of valleys and mountains, which had
never, since the formation of the globe, been exposed to the sun. But
the tide soon returned, with the weight of an immense and irresistible
deluge, which was severely felt on the coasts of Sicily, of Dalmatia,
of Greece, and of Egypt: large boats were transported, and lodged on
the roofs of houses, or at the distance of two miles from the shore; the
people, with their habitations, were swept away by the waters; and the
city of Alexandria annually commemorated the fatal day, on which fifty
thousand persons had lost their lives in the inundation. This calamity,
the report of which was magnified from one province to another,
astonished and terrified the subjects of Rome; and their affrighted
imagination enlarged the real extent of a momentary evil. They
recollected the preceding earthquakes, which had subverted the cities
of Palestine and Bithynia: they considered these alarming strokes as the
prelude only of still more dreadful calamities, and their fearful
vanity was disposed to confound the symptoms of a declining empire and
a sinking world. <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> It was the fashion of the times to attribute every
remarkable event to the particular will of the Deity; the alterations
of nature were connected, by an invisible chain, with the moral and
metaphysical opinions of the human mind; and the most sagacious
divines could distinguish, according to the color of their respective
prejudices, that the establishment of heresy tended to produce an
earthquake; or that a deluge was the inevitable consequence of the
progress of sin and error. Without presuming to discuss the truth or
propriety of these lofty speculations, the historian may content himself
with an observation, which seems to be justified by experience, that man
has much more to fear from the passions of his fellow-creatures, than
from the convulsions of the elements. <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> The mischievous effects of an
earthquake, or deluge, a hurricane, or the eruption of a volcano, bear
a very inconsiderable portion to the ordinary calamities of war, as they
are now moderated by the prudence or humanity of the princes of Europe,
who amuse their own leisure, and exercise the courage of their subjects,
in the practice of the military art. But the laws and manners of modern
nations protect the safety and freedom of the vanquished soldier; and
the peaceful citizen has seldom reason to complain, that his life,
or even his fortune, is exposed to the rage of war. In the disastrous
period of the fall of the Roman empire, which may justly be dated from
the reign of Valens, the happiness and security of each individual were
personally attacked; and the arts and labors of ages were rudely defaced
by the Barbarians of Scythia and Germany. The invasion of the Huns
precipitated on the provinces of the West the Gothic nation, which
advanced, in less than forty years, from the Danube to the Atlantic, and
opened a way, by the success of their arms, to the inroads of so many
hostile tribes, more savage than themselves. The original principle
of motion was concealed in the remote countries of the North; and
the curious observation of the pastoral life of the Scythians, <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a>
or Tartars, <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> will illustrate the latent cause of these destructive
emigrations.

[ The Tatars, or Tartars, were a primitive tribe, the rivals,
and at length the subjects, of the Moguls. In the victorious armies of
Zingis Khan, and his successors, the Tartars formed the vanguard; and
the name, which first reached the ears of foreigners, was applied to the
whole nation, (Freret, in the Hist. de l'Academie, tom. xviii. p. 60.)
In speaking of all, or any of the northern shepherds of Europe, or Asia,
I indifferently use the appellations of Scythians or Tartars. * Note:
The Moguls, (Mongols,) according to M. Klaproth, are a tribe of the
Tartar nation. Tableaux Hist. de l'Asie, p. 154.&mdash;M.]
</p>
<p>
The different characters that mark the civilized nations of the globe,
may be ascribed to the use, and the abuse, of reason; which so variously
shapes, and so artificially composes, the manners and opinions of a
European, or a Chinese. But the operation of instinct is more sure and
simple than that of reason: it is much easier to ascertain the appetites
of a quadruped than the speculations of a philosopher; and the savage
tribes of mankind, as they approach nearer to the condition of animals,
preserve a stronger resemblance to themselves and to each other. The
uniform stability of their manners is the natural consequence of the
imperfection of their faculties. Reduced to a similar situation, their
wants, their desires, their enjoyments, still continue the same: and
the influence of food or climate, which, in a more improved state
of society, is suspended, or subdued, by so many moral causes, most
powerfully contributes to form, and to maintain, the national character
of Barbarians. In every age, the immense plains of Scythia, or Tartary,
have been inhabited by vagrant tribes of hunters and shepherds, whose
indolence refuses to cultivate the earth, and whose restless spirit
disdains the confinement of a sedentary life. In every age, the
Scythians, and Tartars, have been renowned for their invincible courage
and rapid conquests. The thrones of Asia have been repeatedly overturned
by the shepherds of the North; and their arms have spread terror and
devastation over the most fertile and warlike countries of Europe. <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a>
On this occasion, as well as on many others, the sober historian is
forcibly awakened from a pleasing vision; and is compelled, with some
reluctance, to confess, that the pastoral manners, which have been
adorned with the fairest attributes of peace and innocence, are much
better adapted to the fierce and cruel habits of a military life. To
illustrate this observation, I shall now proceed to consider a nation of
shepherds and of warriors, in the three important articles of, I. Their
diet; II. Their habitations; and, III. Their exercises. The narratives
of antiquity are justified by the experience of modern times; <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> and
the banks of the Borysthenes, of the Volga, or of the Selinga, will
indifferently present the same uniform spectacle of similar and native
manners. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a>

[ The fourth book of Herodotus affords a curious though
imperfect, portrait of the Scythians. Among the moderns, who describe
the uniform scene, the Khan of Khowaresm, Abulghazi Bahadur, expresses
his native feelings; and his genealogical history of the Tartars has
been copiously illustrated by the French and English editors. Carpin,
Ascelin, and Rubruquis (in the Hist. des Voyages, tom. vii.) represent
the Moguls of the fourteenth century. To these guides I have added
Gerbillon, and the other Jesuits, (Description de la China par du Halde,
tom. iv.,) who accurately surveyed the Chinese Tartary; and that honest
and intelligent traveller, Bell, of Antermony, (two volumes in 4to.
Glasgow, 1763.) * Note: Of the various works published since the time of
Gibbon, which throw fight on the nomadic population of Central Asia, may
be particularly remarked the Travels and Dissertations of Pallas; and
above all, the very curious work of Bergman, Nomadische Streifereyen.

I. The corn, or even the rice, which constitutes the ordinary and
wholesome food of a civilized people, can be obtained only by the
patient toil of the husbandman. Some of the happy savages, who dwell
between the tropics, are plentifully nourished by the liberality of
nature; but in the climates of the North, a nation of shepherds is
reduced to their flocks and herds. The skilful practitioners of the
medical art will determine (if they are able to determine) how far the
temper of the human mind may be affected by the use of animal, or of
vegetable, food; and whether the common association of carniverous
and cruel deserves to be considered in any other light than that of an
innocent, perhaps a salutary, prejudice of humanity. <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> Yet, if it be
true, that the sentiment of compassion is imperceptibly weakened by the
sight and practice of domestic cruelty, we may observe, that the horrid
objects which are disguised by the arts of European refinement, are
exhibited in their naked and most disgusting simplicity in the tent of
a Tartarian shepherd. The ox, or the sheep, are slaughtered by the same
hand from which they were accustomed to receive their daily food; and
the bleeding limbs are served, with very little preparation, on the
table of their unfeeling murderer. In the military profession, and
especially in the conduct of a numerous army, the exclusive use of
animal food appears to be productive of the most solid advantages. Corn
is a bulky and perishable commodity; and the large magazines, which
are indispensably necessary for the subsistence of our troops, must be
slowly transported by the labor of men or horses. But the flocks and
herds, which accompany the march of the Tartars, afford a sure and
increasing supply of flesh and milk: in the far greater part of the
uncultivated waste, the vegetation of the grass is quick and luxuriant;
and there are few places so extremely barren, that the hardy cattle of
the North cannot find some tolerable pasture.
</p>
<p>
The supply is multiplied and prolonged by the undistinguishing appetite,
and patient abstinence, of the Tartars. They indifferently feed on the
flesh of those animals that have been killed for the table, or have
died of disease. Horseflesh, which in every age and country has been
proscribed by the civilized nations of Europe and Asia, they devour with
peculiar greediness; and this singular taste facilitates the success
of their military operations. The active cavalry of Scythia is always
followed, in their most distant and rapid incursions, by an adequate
number of spare horses, who may be occasionally used, either to redouble
the speed, or to satisfy the hunger, of the Barbarians. Many are the
resources of courage and poverty. When the forage round a camp of
Tartars is almost consumed, they slaughter the greatest part of their
cattle, and preserve the flesh, either smoked, or dried in the sun. On
the sudden emergency of a hasty march, they provide themselves with a
sufficient quantity of little balls of cheese, or rather of hard curd,
which they occasionally dissolve in water; and this unsubstantial diet
will support, for many days, the life, and even the spirits, of the
patient warrior. But this extraordinary abstinence, which the Stoic
would approve, and the hermit might envy, is commonly succeeded by the
most voracious indulgence of appetite. The wines of a happier climate
are the most grateful present, or the most valuable commodity, that can
be offered to the Tartars; and the only example of their industry seems
to consist in the art of extracting from mare's milk a fermented liquor,
which possesses a very strong power of intoxication. Like the animals
of prey, the savages, both of the old and new world, experience the
alternate vicissitudes of famine and plenty; and their stomach is inured
to sustain, without much inconvenience, the opposite extremes of hunger
and of intemperance.

[ Il est certain que les grands mangeurs de viande sont en
general cruels et feroces plus que les autres hommes. Cette observation
est de tous les lieux, et de tous les temps: la barbarie Angloise est
connue, &amp;c. Emile de Rousseau, tom. i. p. 274. Whatever we may think
of the general observation, we shall not easily allow the truth of
his example. The good-natured complaints of Plutarch, and the pathetic
lamentations of Ovid, seduce our reason, by exciting our sensibility.]
</p>
<p>
II. In the ages of rustic and martial simplicity, a people of soldiers
and husbandmen are dispersed over the face of an extensive and
cultivated country; and some time must elapse before the warlike youth
of Greece or Italy could be assembled under the same standard, either to
defend their own confines, or to invade the territories of the adjacent
tribes. The progress of manufactures and commerce insensibly collects
a large multitude within the walls of a city: but these citizens are no
longer soldiers; and the arts which adorn and improve the state of civil
society, corrupt the habits of the military life. The pastoral manners
of the Scythians seem to unite the different advantages of simplicity
and refinement. The individuals of the same tribe are constantly
assembled, but they are assembled in a camp; and the native spirit of
these dauntless shepherds is animated by mutual support and emulation.
The houses of the Tartars are no more than small tents, of an oval form,
which afford a cold and dirty habitation, for the promiscuous youth of
both sexes. The palaces of the rich consist of wooden huts, of such a
size that they may be conveniently fixed on large wagons, and drawn by
a team perhaps of twenty or thirty oxen. The flocks and herds, after
grazing all day in the adjacent pastures, retire, on the approach of
night, within the protection of the camp. The necessity of preventing
the most mischievous confusion, in such a perpetual concourse of men and
animals, must gradually introduce, in the distribution, the order, and
the guard, of the encampment, the rudiments of the military art. As soon
as the forage of a certain district is consumed, the tribe, or rather
army, of shepherds, makes a regular march to some fresh pastures; and
thus acquires, in the ordinary occupations of the pastoral life,
the practical knowledge of one of the most important and difficult
operations of war. The choice of stations is regulated by the difference
of the seasons: in the summer, the Tartars advance towards the North,
and pitch their tents on the banks of a river, or, at least, in the
neighborhood of a running stream. But in the winter, they return to the
South, and shelter their camp, behind some convenient eminence, against
the winds, which are chilled in their passage over the bleak and icy
regions of Siberia. These manners are admirably adapted to diffuse,
among the wandering tribes, the spirit of emigration and conquest.
The connection between the people and their territory is of so frail a
texture, that it may be broken by the slightest accident. The camp, and
not the soil, is the native country of the genuine Tartar. Within the
precincts of that camp, his family, his companions, his property,
are always included; and, in the most distant marches, he is still
surrounded by the objects which are dear, or valuable, or familiar in
his eyes. The thirst of rapine, the fear, or the resentment of injury,
the impatience of servitude, have, in every age, been sufficient causes
to urge the tribes of Scythia boldly to advance into some unknown
countries, where they might hope to find a more plentiful subsistence
or a less formidable enemy. The revolutions of the North have frequently
determined the fate of the South; and in the conflict of hostile
nations, the victor and the vanquished have alternately drove, and been
driven, from the confines of China to those of Germany. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> These great
emigrations, which have been sometimes executed with almost incredible
diligence, were rendered more easy by the peculiar nature of the
climate. It is well known that the cold of Tartary is much more severe
than in the midst of the temperate zone might reasonably be expected;
this uncommon rigor is attributed to the height of the plains, which
rise, especially towards the East, more than half a mile above the level
of the sea; and to the quantity of saltpetre with which the soil is
deeply impregnated. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> In the winter season, the broad and rapid
rivers, that discharge their waters into the Euxine, the Caspian, or the
Icy Sea, are strongly frozen; the fields are covered with a bed of snow;
and the fugitive, or victorious, tribes may securely traverse, with
their families, their wagons, and their cattle, the smooth and hard
surface of an immense plain.

[ A plain in the Chinese Tartary, only eighty leagues from
the great wall, was found by the missionaries to be three thousand
geometrical paces above the level of the sea. Montesquieu, who has used,
and abused, the relations of travellers, deduces the revolutions of
Asia from this important circumstance, that heat and cold, weakness and
strength, touch each other without any temperate zone, (Esprit des Loix,
l. xvii. c. 3.)]
</p>
<p>
III. The pastoral life, compared with the labors of agriculture and
manufactures, is undoubtedly a life of idleness; and as the most
honorable shepherds of the Tartar race devolve on their captives the
domestic management of the cattle, their own leisure is seldom disturbed
by any servile and assiduous cares. But this leisure, instead of being
devoted to the soft enjoyments of love and harmony, is use fully spent
in the violent and sanguinary exercise of the chase. The plains of
Tartary are filled with a strong and serviceable breed of horses, which
are easily trained for the purposes of war and hunting. The Scythians of
every age have been celebrated as bold and skilful riders; and constant
practice had seated them so firmly on horseback, that they were supposed
by strangers to perform the ordinary duties of civil life, to eat, to
drink, and even to sleep, without dismounting from their steeds. They
excel in the dexterous management of the lance; the long Tartar bow
is drawn with a nervous arm; and the weighty arrow is directed to its
object with unerring aim and irresistible force. These arrows are often
pointed against the harmless animals of the desert, which increase and
multiply in the absence of their most formidable enemy; the hare, the
goat, the roebuck, the fallow-deer, the stag, the elk, and the antelope.
The vigor and patience, both of the men and horses, are continually
exercised by the fatigues of the chase; and the plentiful supply of game
contributes to the subsistence, and even luxury, of a Tartar camp.
But the exploits of the hunters of Scythia are not confined to the
destruction of timid or innoxious beasts; they boldly encounter the
angry wild boar, when he turns against his pursuers, excite the sluggish
courage of the bear, and provoke the fury of the tiger, as he slumbers
in the thicket. Where there is danger, there may be glory; and the mode
of hunting, which opens the fairest field to the exertions of valor,
may justly be considered as the image, and as the school, of war. The
general hunting matches, the pride and delight of the Tartar princes,
compose an instructive exercise for their numerous cavalry. A circle
is drawn, of many miles in circumference, to encompass the game of
an extensive district; and the troops that form the circle regularly
advance towards a common centre; where the captive animals, surrounded
on every side, are abandoned to the darts of the hunters. In this march,
which frequently continues many days, the cavalry are obliged to climb
the hills, to swim the rivers, and to wind through the valleys, without
interrupting the prescribed order of their gradual progress. They
acquire the habit of directing their eye, and their steps, to a remote
object; of preserving their intervals of suspending or accelerating
their pace, according to the motions of the troops on their right and
left; and of watching and repeating the signals of their leaders. Their
leaders study, in this practical school, the most important lesson
of the military art; the prompt and accurate judgment of ground, of
distance, and of time. To employ against a human enemy the same patience
and valor, the same skill and discipline, is the only alteration which
is required in real war; and the amusements of the chase serve as a
prelude to the conquest of an empire. <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a>

<p>
The political society of the ancient Germans has the appearance of
a voluntary alliance of independent warriors. The tribes of Scythia,
distinguished by the modern appellation of Hords, assume the form of
a numerous and increasing family; which, in the course of successive
generations, has been propagated from the same original stock. The
meanest, and most ignorant, of the Tartars, preserve, with conscious
pride, the inestimable treasure of their genealogy; and whatever
distinctions of rank may have been introduced, by the unequal
distribution of pastoral wealth, they mutually respect themselves, and
each other, as the descendants of the first founder of the tribe. The
custom, which still prevails, of adopting the bravest and most faithful
of the captives, may countenance the very probable suspicion, that this
extensive consanguinity is, in a great measure, legal and fictitious.
But the useful prejudice, which has obtained the sanction of time and
opinion, produces the effects of truth; the haughty Barbarians yield a
cheerful and voluntary obedience to the head of their blood; and their
chief, or mursa, as the representative of their great father, exercises
the authority of a judge in peace, and of a leader in war. In the
original state of the pastoral world, each of the mursas (if we may
continue to use a modern appellation) acted as the independent chief
of a large and separate family; and the limits of their peculiar
territories were gradually fixed by superior force, or mutual consent.
But the constant operation of various and permanent causes contributed
to unite the vagrant Hords into national communities, under the command
of a supreme head. The weak were desirous of support, and the strong
were ambitious of dominion; the power, which is the result of union,
oppressed and collected the divided force of the adjacent tribes;
and, as the vanquished were freely admitted to share the advantages of
victory, the most valiant chiefs hastened to range themselves and their
followers under the formidable standard of a confederate nation. The
most successful of the Tartar princes assumed the military command, to
which he was entitled by the superiority, either of merit or of power.
He was raised to the throne by the acclamations of his equals; and the
title of Khan expresses, in the language of the North of Asia, the full
extent of the regal dignity. The right of hereditary succession was long
confined to the blood of the founder of the monarchy; and at this moment
all the Khans, who reign from Crimea to the wall of China, are the
lineal descendants of the renowned Zingis. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> But, as it is the
indispensable duty of a Tartar sovereign to lead his warlike subjects
into the field, the claims of an infant are often disregarded; and some
royal kinsman, distinguished by his age and valor, is intrusted with the
sword and sceptre of his predecessor. Two distinct and regular taxes are
levied on the tribes, to support the dignity of the national monarch,
and of their peculiar chief; and each of those contributions amounts
to the tithe, both of their property, and of their spoil. A Tartar
sovereign enjoys the tenth part of the wealth of his people; and as
his own domestic riches of flocks and herds increase in a much larger
proportion, he is able plentifully to maintain the rustic splendor of
his court, to reward the most deserving, or the most favored of his
followers, and to obtain, from the gentle influence of corruption, the
obedience which might be sometimes refused to the stern mandates of
authority. The manners of his subjects, accustomed, like himself, to
blood and rapine, might excuse, in their eyes, such partial acts of
tyranny, as would excite the horror of a civilized people; but the power
of a despot has never been acknowledged in the deserts of Scythia. The
immediate jurisdiction of the khan is confined within the limits of his
own tribe; and the exercise of his royal prerogative has been moderated
by the ancient institution of a national council. The Coroulai, <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> or
Diet, of the Tartars, was regularly held in the spring and autumn, in
the midst of a plain; where the princes of the reigning family, and the
mursas of the respective tribes, may conveniently assemble on horseback,
with their martial and numerous trains; and the ambitious monarch, who
reviewed the strength, must consult the inclination of an armed
people. The rudiments of a feudal government may be discovered in
the constitution of the Scythian or Tartar nations; but the perpetual
conflict of those hostile nations has sometimes terminated in the
establishment of a powerful and despotic empire. The victor, enriched
by the tribute, and fortified by the arms of dependent kings, has spread
his conquests over Europe or Asia: the successful shepherds of the North
have submitted to the confinement of arts, of laws, and of cities; and
the introduction of luxury, after destroying the freedom of the people,
has undermined the foundations of the throne. <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a>

The memory of past events cannot long be preserved in the frequent and
remote emigrations of illiterate Barbarians. The modern Tartars are
ignorant of the conquests of their ancestors; <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> and our knowledge of
the history of the Scythians is derived from their intercourse with the
learned and civilized nations of the South, the Greeks, the Persians,
and the Chinese. The Greeks, who navigated the Euxine, and planted their
colonies along the sea-coast, made the gradual and imperfect discovery
of Scythia; from the Danube, and the confines of Thrace, as far as the
frozen Maeotis, the seat of eternal winter, and Mount Caucasus, which,
in the language of poetry, was described as the utmost boundary of
the earth. They celebrated, with simple credulity, the virtues of the
pastoral life: <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> they entertained a more rational apprehension of the
strength and numbers of the warlike Barbarians, <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> who contemptuously
baffled the immense armament of Darius, the son of Hystaspes. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> The
Persian monarchs had extended their western conquests to the banks of
the Danube, and the limits of European Scythia. The eastern provinces of
their empire were exposed to the Scythians of Asia; the wild inhabitants
of the plains beyond the Oxus and the Jaxartes, two mighty rivers, which
direct their course towards the Caspian Sea. The long and memorable
quarrel of Iran and Touran is still the theme of history or romance: the
famous, perhaps the fabulous, valor of the Persian heroes, Rustan and
Asfendiar, was signalized, in the defence of their country, against
the Afrasiabs of the North; <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> and the invincible spirit of the same
Barbarians resisted, on the same ground, the victorious arms of Cyrus
and Alexander. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> In the eyes of the Greeks and Persians, the real
geography of Scythia was bounded, on the East, by the mountains
of Imaus, or Caf; and their distant prospect of the extreme and
inaccessible parts of Asia was clouded by ignorance, or perplexed by
fiction. But those inaccessible regions are the ancient residence of
a powerful and civilized nation, <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> which ascends, by a probable
tradition, above forty centuries; <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> and which is able to verify
a series of near two thousand years, by the perpetual testimony of
accurate and contemporary historians. <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> The annals of China <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a>
illustrate the state and revolutions of the pastoral tribes, which
may still be distinguished by the vague appellation of Scythians, or
Tartars; the vassals, the enemies, and sometimes the conquerors, of a
great empire; whose policy has uniformly opposed the blind and impetuous
valor of the Barbarians of the North. From the mouth of the Danube to
the Sea of Japan, the whole longitude of Scythia is about one hundred
and ten degrees, which, in that parallel, are equal to more than five
thousand miles. The latitude of these extensive deserts cannot be so
easily, or so accurately, measured; but, from the fortieth degree, which
touches the wall of China, we may securely advance above a thousand
miles to the northward, till our progress is stopped by the excessive
cold of Siberia. In that dreary climate, instead of the animated picture
of a Tartar camp, the smoke that issues from the earth, or rather from
the snow, betrays the subterraneous dwellings of the Tongouses, and the
Samoides: the want of horses and oxen is imperfectly supplied by the
use of reindeer, and of large dogs; and the conquerors of the earth
insensibly degenerate into a race of deformed and diminutive savages,
who tremble at the sound of arms. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXVI: Progress of The Huns.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
The Huns, who under the reign of Valens threatened the empire of Rome,
had been formidable, in a much earlier period, to the empire of China.
<a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> Their ancient, perhaps their original, seat was an extensive,
though dry and barren, tract of country, immediately on the north side
of the great wall. Their place is at present occupied by the forty-nine
Hords or Banners of the Mongous, a pastoral nation, which consists of
about two hundred thousand families. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a> But the valor of the Huns had
extended the narrow limits of their dominions; and their rustic chiefs,
who assumed the appellation of Tanjou, gradually became the conquerors,
and the sovereigns of a formidable empire. Towards the East, their
victorious arms were stopped only by the ocean; and the tribes, which
are thinly scattered between the Amoor and the extreme peninsula of
Corea, adhered, with reluctance, to the standard of the Huns. On the
West, near the head of the Irtish, in the valleys of Imaus, they found
a more ample space, and more numerous enemies. One of the lieutenants
of the Tanjou subdued, in a single expedition, twenty-six nations; the
Igours, <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> distinguished above the Tartar race by the use of letters,
were in the number of his vassals; and, by the strange connection of
human events, the flight of one of those vagrant tribes recalled the
victorious Parthians from the invasion of Syria. <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> On the side of
the North, the ocean was assigned as the limit of the power of the Huns.
Without enemies to resist their progress, or witnesses to contradict
their vanity, they might securely achieve a real, or imaginary, conquest
of the frozen regions of Siberia. The Northren Sea was fixed as the
remote boundary of their empire. But the name of that sea, on whose
shores the patriot Sovou embraced the life of a shepherd and an exile,
<a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> may be transferred, with much more probability, to the Baikal, a
capacious basin, above three hundred miles in length, which disdains the
modest appellation of a lake <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> and which actually communicates with
the seas of the North, by the long course of the Angara, the Tongusha,
and the Jenissea. The submission of so many distant nations might
flatter the pride of the Tanjou; but the valor of the Huns could be
rewarded only by the enjoyment of the wealth and luxury of the empire of
the South. In the third century <a href="#note-3211" name="noteref-3211"><small>3211</small></a> before the Christian aera, a
wall of fifteen hundred miles in length was constructed, to defend
the frontiers of China against the inroads of the Huns; <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> but this
stupendous work, which holds a conspicuous place in the map of the
world, has never contributed to the safety of an unwarlike people.
The cavalry of the Tanjou frequently consisted of two or three hundred
thousand men, formidable by the matchless dexterity with which they
managed their bows and their horses: by their hardy patience in
supporting the inclemency of the weather; and by the incredible speed of
their march, which was seldom checked by torrents, or precipices, by the
deepest rivers, or by the most lofty mountains. They spread themselves
at once over the face of the country; and their rapid impetuosity
surprised, astonished, and disconcerted the grave and elaborate tactics
of a Chinese army. The emperor Kaoti, <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> a soldier of fortune, whose
personal merit had raised him to the throne, marched against the Huns
with those veteran troops which had been trained in the civil wars of
China. But he was soon surrounded by the Barbarians; and, after a siege
of seven days, the monarch, hopeless of relief, was reduced to purchase
his deliverance by an ignominious capitulation. The successors of Kaoti,
whose lives were dedicated to the arts of peace, or the luxury of
the palace, submitted to a more permanent disgrace. They too hastily
confessed the insufficiency of arms and fortifications. They were too
easily convinced, that while the blazing signals announced on every side
the approach of the Huns, the Chinese troops, who slept with the helmet
on their head, and the cuirass on their back, were destroyed by the
incessant labor of ineffectual marches. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> A regular payment of money,
and silk, was stipulated as the condition of a temporary and precarious
peace; and the wretched expedient of disguising a real tribute, under
the names of a gift or subsidy, was practised by the emperors of China
as well as by those of Rome. But there still remained a more disgraceful
article of tribute, which violated the sacred feelings of humanity and
nature. The hardships of the savage life, which destroy in their infancy
the children who are born with a less healthy and robust constitution,
introduced a remarkable disproportion between the numbers of the two
sexes. The Tartars are an ugly and even deformed race; and while they
consider their own women as the instruments of domestic labor, their
desires, or rather their appetites, are directed to the enjoyment of
more elegant beauty. A select band of the fairest maidens of China was
annually devoted to the rude embraces of the Huns; <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> and the alliance
of the haughty Tanjous was secured by their marriage with the genuine,
or adopted, daughters of the Imperial family, which vainly attempted
to escape the sacrilegious pollution. The situation of these unhappy
victims is described in the verses of a Chinese princess, who laments
that she had been condemned by her parents to a distant exile, under a
Barbarian husband; who complains that sour milk was her only drink, raw
flesh her only food, a tent her only palace; and who expresses, in
a strain of pathetic simplicity, the natural wish, that she were
transformed into a bird, to fly back to her dear country; the object of
her tender and perpetual regret. <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a>

[ M. de Guignes (tom. ii. p. 1&mdash;124) has given the original
history of the ancient Hiong-nou, or Huns. The Chinese geography of
their country (tom. i. part. p. lv.&mdash;lxiii.) seems to comprise a part of
their conquests. * Note: The theory of De Guignes on the early history
of the Huns is, in general, rejected by modern writers. De Guignes
advanced no valid proof of the identity of the Hioung-nou of the
Chinese writers with the Huns, except the similarity of name. Schlozer,
(Allgemeine Nordische Geschichte, p. 252,) Klaproth, (Tableaux
Historiques de l'Asie, p. 246,) St. Martin, iv. 61, and A. Remusat,
(Recherches sur les Langues Tartares, D. P. xlvi, and p. 328; though in
the latter passage he considers the theory of De Guignes not absolutely
disproved,) concur in considering the Huns as belonging to the Finnish
stock, distinct from the Moguls the Mandscheus, and the Turks. The
Hiong-nou, according to Klaproth, were Turks. The names of the Hunnish
chiefs could not be pronounced by a Turk; and, according to the same
author, the Hioung-nou, which is explained in Chinese as detestable
slaves, as early as the year 91 J. C., were dispersed by the Chinese,
and assumed the name of Yue-po or Yue-pan. M. St. Martin does not
consider it impossible that the appellation of Hioung-nou may have
belonged to the Huns. But all agree in considering the Madjar or Magyar
of modern Hungary the descendants of the Huns. Their language (compare
Gibbon, c. lv. n. 22) is nearly related to the Lapponian and Vogoul. The
noble forms of the modern Hungarians, so strongly contrasted with the
hideous pictures which the fears and the hatred of the Romans give
of the Huns, M. Klaproth accounts for by the intermingling with other
races, Turkish and Slavonian. The present state of the question is
thus stated in the last edition of Malte Brun, and a new and ingenious
hypothesis suggested to resolve all the difficulties of the question.
Were the Huns Finns? This obscure question has not been debated till
very recently, and is yet very far from being decided. We are of opinion
that it will be so hereafter in the same manner as that with regard to
the Scythians. We shall trace in the portrait of Attila a dominant tribe
or Mongols, or Kalmucks, with all the hereditary ugliness of that race;
but in the mass of the Hunnish army and nation will be recognized the
Chuni and the Ounni of the Greek Geography. the Kuns of the Hungarians,
the European Huns, and a race in close relationship with the Flemish
stock. Malte Brun, vi. p. 94. This theory is more fully and ably
developed, p. 743. Whoever has seen the emperor of Austria's Hungarian
guard, will not readily admit their descent from the Huns described by
Sidonius Appolinaris.&mdash;M]

<p>
The conquest of China has been twice achieved by the pastoral tribes of
the North: the forces of the Huns were not inferior to those of the
Moguls, or of the Mantcheoux; and their ambition might entertain the
most sanguine hopes of success. But their pride was humbled, and their
progress was checked, by the arms and policy of Vouti, <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> the fifth
emperor of the powerful dynasty of the Han. In his long reign of fifty-
four years, the Barbarians of the southern provinces submitted to the
laws and manners of China; and the ancient limits of the monarchy were
enlarged, from the great river of Kiang, to the port of Canton. Instead
of confining himself to the timid operations of a defensive war, his
lieutenants penetrated many hundred miles into the country of the Huns.
In those boundless deserts, where it is impossible to form magazines,
and difficult to transport a sufficient supply of provisions, the armies
of Vouti were repeatedly exposed to intolerable hardships: and, of one
hundred and forty thousand soldiers, who marched against the Barbarians,
thirty thousand only returned in safety to the feet of their master.
These losses, however, were compensated by splendid and decisive
success. The Chinese generals improved the superiority which they
derived from the temper of their arms, their chariots of war, and the
service of their Tartar auxiliaries. The camp of the Tanjou was
surprised in the midst of sleep and intemperance; and, though the
monarch of the Huns bravely cut his way through the ranks of the enemy,
he left above fifteen thousand of his subjects on the field of battle.
Yet this signal victory, which was preceded and followed by many bloody
engagements, contributed much less to the destruction of the power of
the Huns than the effectual policy which was employed to detach the
tributary nations from their obedience. Intimidated by the arms, or
allured by the promises, of Vouti and his successors, the most
considerable tribes, both of the East and of the West, disclaimed the
authority of the Tanjou. While some acknowledged themselves the allies
or vassals of the empire, they all became the implacable enemies of the
Huns; and the numbers of that haughty people, as soon as they were
reduced to their native strength, might, perhaps, have been contained
within the walls of one of the great and populous cities of China. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a>
The desertion of his subjects, and the perplexity of a civil war, at
length compelled the Tanjou himself to renounce the dignity of an
independent sovereign, and the freedom of a warlike and high-spirited
nation. He was received at Sigan, the capital of the monarchy, by the
troops, the mandarins, and the emperor himself, with all the honors that
could adorn and disguise the triumph of Chinese vanity. <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> A
magnificent palace was prepared for his reception; his place was
assigned above all the princes of the royal family; and the patience of
the Barbarian king was exhausted by the ceremonies of a banquet, which
consisted of eight courses of meat, and of nine solemn pieces of music.
But he performed, on his knees, the duty of a respectful homage to the
emperor of China; pronounced, in his own name, and in the name of his
successors, a perpetual oath of fidelity; and gratefully accepted a
seal, which was bestowed as the emblem of his regal dependence. After
this humiliating submission, the Tanjous sometimes departed from their
allegiance and seized the favorable moments of war and rapine; but the
monarchy of the Huns gradually declined, till it was broken, by civil
dissension, into two hostile and separate kingdoms. One of the princes
of the nation was urged, by fear and ambition, to retire towards the
South with eight hords, which composed between forty and fifty thousand
families. He obtained, with the title of Tanjou, a convenient territory
on the verge of the Chinese provinces; and his constant attachment to
the service of the empire was secured by weakness, and the desire of
revenge. From the time of this fatal schism, the Huns of the North
continued to languish about fifty years; till they were oppressed on
every side by their foreign and domestic enemies. The proud inscription
<a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> of a column, erected on a lofty mountain, announced to posterity,
that a Chinese army had marched seven hundred miles into the heart of
their country. The Sienpi, <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> a tribe of Oriental Tartars, retaliated
the injuries which they had formerly sustained; and the power of the
Tanjous, after a reign of thirteen hundred years, was utterly destroyed
before the end of the first century of the Christian aera. <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The fate of the vanquished Huns was diversified by the various influence
of character and situation. <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> Above one hundred thousand persons,
the poorest, indeed, and the most pusillanimous of the people, were
contented to remain in their native country, to renounce their peculiar
name and origin, and to mingle with the victorious nation of the Sienpi.
Fifty-eight hords, about two hundred thousand men, ambitious of a more
honorable servitude, retired towards the South; implored the protection
of the emperors of China; and were permitted to inhabit, and to guard,
the extreme frontiers of the province of Chansi and the territory of
Ortous. But the most warlike and powerful tribes of the Huns maintained,
in their adverse fortune, the undaunted spirit of their ancestors. The
Western world was open to their valor; and they resolved, under the
conduct of their hereditary chieftains, to conquer and subdue some
remote country, which was still inaccessible to the arms of the Sienpi,
and to the laws of China. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> The course of their emigration soon
carried them beyond the mountains of Imaus, and the limits of the
Chinese geography; but we are able to distinguish the two great
divisions of these formidable exiles, which directed their march towards
the Oxus, and towards the Volga. The first of these colonies established
their dominion in the fruitful and extensive plains of Sogdiana, on the
eastern side of the Caspian; where they preserved the name of Huns,
with the epithet of Euthalites, or Nepthalites. <a href="#note-4511" name="noteref-4511"><small>4511</small></a> Their manners
were softened, and even their features were insensibly improved, by
the mildness of the climate, and their long residence in a flourishing
province, <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a> which might still retain a faint impression of the arts
of Greece. <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> The white Huns, a name which they derived from the
change of their complexions, soon abandoned the pastoral life of
Scythia. Gorgo, which, under the appellation of Carizme, has since
enjoyed a temporary splendor, was the residence of the king, who
exercised a legal authority over an obedient people. Their luxury was
maintained by the labor of the Sogdians; and the only vestige of their
ancient barbarism, was the custom which obliged all the companions,
perhaps to the number of twenty, who had shared the liberality of a
wealthy lord, to be buried alive in the same grave. <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> The vicinity
of the Huns to the provinces of Persia, involved them in frequent and
bloody contests with the power of that monarchy. But they respected,
in peace, the faith of treaties; in war, she dictates of humanity;
and their memorable victory over Peroses, or Firuz, displayed the
moderation, as well as the valor, of the Barbarians. The second division
of their countrymen, the Huns, who gradually advanced towards the
North-west, were exercised by the hardships of a colder climate, and a
more laborious march. Necessity compelled them to exchange the silks of
China for the furs of Siberia; the imperfect rudiments of civilized life
were obliterated; and the native fierceness of the Huns was exasperated
by their intercourse with the savage tribes, who were compared, with
some propriety, to the wild beasts of the desert. Their independent
spirit soon rejected the hereditary succession of the Tanjous; and while
each horde was governed by its peculiar mursa, their tumultuary council
directed the public measures of the whole nation. As late as the
thirteenth century, their transient residence on the eastern banks of
the Volga was attested by the name of Great Hungary. <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> In the winter,
they descended with their flocks and herds towards the mouth of that
mighty river; and their summer excursions reached as high as the
latitude of Saratoff, or perhaps the conflux of the Kama. Such at least
were the recent limits of the black Calmucks, <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> who remained about a
century under the protection of Russia; and who have since returned to
their native seats on the frontiers of the Chinese empire. The march,
and the return, of those wandering Tartars, whose united camp consists
of fifty thousand tents or families, illustrate the distant emigrations
of the ancient Huns. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a>

It is impossible to fill the dark interval of time, which elapsed, after
the Huns of the Volga were lost in the eyes of the Chinese, and before
they showed themselves to those of the Romans. There is some reason,
however, to apprehend, that the same force which had driven them from
their native seats, still continued to impel their march towards the
frontiers of Europe. The power of the Sienpi, their implacable enemies,
which extended above three thousand miles from East to West, <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> must
have gradually oppressed them by the weight and terror of a formidable
neighborhood; and the flight of the tribes of Scythia would inevitably
tend to increase the strength or to contract the territories, of the
Huns. The harsh and obscure appellations of those tribes would offend
the ear, without informing the understanding, of the reader; but I
cannot suppress the very natural suspicion, that the Huns of the North
derived a considerable reenforcement from the ruin of the dynasty of
the South, which, in the course of the third century, submitted to the
dominion of China; that the bravest warriors marched away in search
of their free and adventurous countrymen; and that, as they had been
divided by prosperity, they were easily reunited by the common hardships
of their adverse fortune. <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> The Huns, with their flocks and herds,
their wives and children, their dependents and allies, were transported
to the west of the Volga, and they boldly advanced to invade the country
of the Alani, a pastoral people, who occupied, or wasted, an extensive
tract of the deserts of Scythia. The plains between the Volga and the
Tanais were covered with the tents of the Alani, but their name and
manners were diffused over the wide extent of their conquests; and the
painted tribes of the Agathyrsi and Geloni were confounded among their
vassals. Towards the North, they penetrated into the frozen regions of
Siberia, among the savages who were accustomed, in their rage or hunger,
to the taste of human flesh; and their Southern inroads were pushed as
far as the confines of Persia and India. The mixture of Samartic and
German blood had contributed to improve the features of the Alani, <a href="#note-5311" name="noteref-5311"><small>5311</small></a>
to whiten their swarthy complexions, and to tinge their hair with a
yellowish cast, which is seldom found in the Tartar race. They were less
deformed in their persons, less brutish in their manners, than the Huns;
but they did not yield to those formidable Barbarians in their martial
and independent spirit; in the love of freedom, which rejected even the
use of domestic slaves; and in the love of arms, which considered war
and rapine as the pleasure and the glory of mankind. A naked cimeter,
fixed in the ground, was the only object of their religious worship; the
scalps of their enemies formed the costly trappings of their horses;
and they viewed, with pity and contempt, the pusillanimous warriors, who
patiently expected the infirmities of age, and the tortures of lingering
disease. <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> On the banks of the Tanais, the military power of the Huns
and the Alani encountered each other with equal valor, but with unequal
success. The Huns prevailed in the bloody contest; the king of the Alani
was slain; and the remains of the vanquished nation were dispersed
by the ordinary alternative of flight or submission. <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> A colony of
exiles found a secure refuge in the mountains of Caucasus, between the
Euxine and the Caspian, where they still preserve their name and their
independence. Another colony advanced, with more intrepid courage,
towards the shores of the Baltic; associated themselves with the
Northern tribes of Germany; and shared the spoil of the Roman provinces
of Gaul and Spain. But the greatest part of the nation of the Alani
embraced the offers of an honorable and advantageous union; and the
Huns, who esteemed the valor of their less fortunate enemies, proceeded,
with an increase of numbers and confidence, to invade the limits of the
Gothic empire.

The great Hermanric, whose dominions extended from the Baltic to the
Euxine, enjoyed, in the full maturity of age and reputation, the fruit
of his victories, when he was alarmed by the formidable approach of
a host of unknown enemies, <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a> on whom his barbarous subjects might,
without injustice, bestow the epithet of Barbarians. The numbers, the
strength, the rapid motions, and the implacable cruelty of the Huns,
were felt, and dreaded, and magnified, by the astonished Goths; who
beheld their fields and villages consumed with flames, and deluged with
indiscriminate slaughter. To these real terrors they added the surprise
and abhorrence which were excited by the shrill voice, the uncouth
gestures, and the strange deformity of the Huns. <a href="#note-5611" name="noteref-5611"><small>5611</small></a> These savages
of Scythia were compared (and the picture had some resemblance) to
the animals who walk very awkwardly on two legs and to the misshapen
figures, the Termini, which were often placed on the bridges of
antiquity. They were distinguished from the rest of the human species by
their broad shoulders, flat noses, and small black eyes, deeply buried
in the head; and as they were almost destitute of beards, they never
enjoyed either the manly grace of youth, or the venerable aspect of age.
<a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> A fabulous origin was assigned, worthy of their form and manners;
that the witches of Scythia, who, for their foul and deadly practices,
had been driven from society, had copulated in the desert with infernal
spirits; and that the Huns were the offspring of this execrable
conjunction. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> The tale, so full of horror and absurdity, was
greedily embraced by the credulous hatred of the Goths; but, while it
gratified their hatred, it increased their fear, since the posterity
of daemons and witches might be supposed to inherit some share of the
praeternatural powers, as well as of the malignant temper, of their
parents. Against these enemies, Hermanric prepared to exert the united
forces of the Gothic state; but he soon discovered that his vassal
tribes, provoked by oppression, were much more inclined to second, than
to repel, the invasion of the Huns. One of the chiefs of the Roxolani
<a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> had formerly deserted the standard of Hermanric, and the cruel
tyrant had condemned the innocent wife of the traitor to be torn asunder
by wild horses. The brothers of that unfortunate woman seized the
favorable moment of revenge.

<p>
The aged king of the Goths languished some time after the dangerous
wound which he received from their daggers; but the conduct of the war
was retarded by his infirmities; and the public councils of the nation
were distracted by a spirit of jealousy and discord. His death, which
has been imputed to his own despair, left the reins of government in
the hands of Withimer, who, with the doubtful aid of some Scythian
mercenaries, maintained the unequal contest against the arms of the Huns
and the Alani, till he was defeated and slain in a decisive battle. The
Ostrogoths submitted to their fate; and the royal race of the Amali will
hereafter be found among the subjects of the haughty Attila. But the
person of Witheric, the infant king, was saved by the diligence of
Alatheus and Saphrax; two warriors of approved valor and fiedlity, who,
by cautious marches, conducted the independent remains of the nation of
the Ostrogoths towards the Danastus, or Niester; a considerable river,
which now separates the Turkish dominions from the empire of Russia. On
the banks of the Niester, the prudent Athanaric, more attentive to his
own than to the general safety, had fixed the camp of the Visigoths;
with the firm resolution of opposing the victorious Barbarians, whom he
thought it less advisable to provoke. The ordinary speed of the Huns was
checked by the weight of baggage, and the encumbrance of captives;
but their military skill deceived, and almost destroyed, the army of
Athanaric. While the Judge of the Visigoths defended the banks of the
Niester, he was encompassed and attacked by a numerous detachment
of cavalry, who, by the light of the moon, had passed the river in a
fordable place; and it was not without the utmost efforts of courage
and conduct, that he was able to effect his retreat towards the hilly
country. The undaunted general had already formed a new and judicious
plan of defensive war; and the strong lines, which he was preparing to
construct between the mountains, the Pruth, and the Danube, would have
secured the extensive and fertile territory that bears the modern name
of Walachia, from the destructive inroads of the Huns. <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> But the
hopes and measures of the Judge of the Visigoths was soon disappointed,
by the trembling impatience of his dismayed countrymen; who were
persuaded by their fears, that the interposition of the Danube was the
only barrier that could save them from the rapid pursuit, and invincible
valor, of the Barbarians of Scythia. Under the command of Fritigern and
Alavivus, <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> the body of the nation hastily advanced to the banks of

<h2>
    Chapter XXVI: Progress of The Huns.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
After Valens had terminated the Gothic war with some appearance of glory
and success, he made a progress through his dominions of Asia, and at
length fixed his residence in the capital of Syria. The five years <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a>
which he spent at Antioch was employed to watch, from a secure distance,
the hostile designs of the Persian monarch; to check the depredations of
the Saracens and Isaurians; <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> to enforce, by arguments more prevalent
than those of reason and eloquence, the belief of the Arian theology;
and to satisfy his anxious suspicions by the promiscuous execution of
the innocent and the guilty. But the attention of the emperor was most
seriously engaged, by the important intelligence which he received from
the civil and military officers who were intrusted with the defence of
the Danube. He was informed, that the North was agitated by a furious
tempest; that the irruption of the Huns, an unknown and monstrous race
of savages, had subverted the power of the Goths; and that the suppliant
multitudes of that warlike nation, whose pride was now humbled in the
dust, covered a space of many miles along the banks of the river. With
outstretched arms, and pathetic lamentations, they loudly deplored their
past misfortunes and their present danger; acknowledged that their only
hope of safety was in the clemency of the Roman government; and most
solemnly protested, that if the gracious liberality of the emperor would
permit them to cultivate the waste lands of Thrace, they should
ever hold themselves bound, by the strongest obligations of duty and
gratitude, to obey the laws, and to guard the limits, of the republic.
These assurances were confirmed by the ambassadors of the Goths, <a href="#note-6411" name="noteref-6411"><small>6411</small></a>
who impatiently expected from the mouth of Valens an answer that must
finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen. The emperor of
the East was no longer guided by the wisdom and authority of his elder
brother, whose death happened towards the end of the preceding year;
and as the distressful situation of the Goths required an instant and
peremptory decision, he was deprived of the favorite resources of feeble
and timid minds, who consider the use of dilatory and ambiguous measures
as the most admirable efforts of consummate prudence. As long as the
same passions and interests subsist among mankind, the questions of war
and peace, of justice and policy, which were debated in the councils of
antiquity, will frequently present themselves as the subject of modern
deliberation. But the most experienced statesman of Europe has never
been summoned to consider the propriety, or the danger, of admitting,
or rejecting, an innumerable multitude of Barbarians, who are driven
by despair and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories of
a civilized nation. When that important proposition, so essentially
connected with the public safety, was referred to the ministers of
Valens, they were perplexed and divided; but they soon acquiesced in the
flattering sentiment which seemed the most favorable to the pride, the
indolence, and the avarice of their sovereign. The slaves, who were
decorated with the titles of praefects and generals, dissembled or
disregarded the terrors of this national emigration; so extremely
different from the partial and accidental colonies, which had been
received on the extreme limits of the empire. But they applauded the
liberality of fortune, which had conducted, from the most distant
countries of the globe, a numerous and invincible army of strangers, to
defend the throne of Valens; who might now add to the royal treasures
the immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to compensate their
annual proportion of recruits. The prayers of the Goths were granted,
and their service was accepted by the Imperial court: and orders were
immediately despatched to the civil and military governors of the
Thracian diocese, to make the necessary preparations for the passage and
subsistence of a great people, till a proper and sufficient territory
could be allotted for their future residence. The liberality of
the emperor was accompanied, however, with two harsh and rigorous
conditions, which prudence might justify on the side of the Romans; but
which distress alone could extort from the indignant Goths. Before they
passed the Danube, they were required to deliver their arms: and it was
insisted, that their children should be taken from them, and dispersed
through the provinces of Asia; where they might be civilized by the
arts of education, and serve as hostages to secure the fidelity of their
parents.

During the suspense of a doubtful and distant negotiation, the impatient
Goths made some rash attempts to pass the Danube, without the permission
of the government, whose protection they had implored. Their motions
were strictly observed by the vigilance of the troops which were
stationed along the river and their foremost detachments were defeated
with considerable slaughter; yet such were the timid councils of the
reign of Valens, that the brave officers who had served their country
in the execution of their duty, were punished by the loss of their
employments, and narrowly escaped the loss of their heads. The Imperial
mandate was at length received for transporting over the Danube the
whole body of the Gothic nation; <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> but the execution of this order
was a task of labor and difficulty. The stream of the Danube, which in
those parts is above a mile broad, <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> had been swelled by incessant
rains; and in this tumultuous passage, many were swept away, and
drowned, by the rapid violence of the current. A large fleet of vessels,
of boats, and of canoes, was provided; many days and nights they passed
and repassed with indefatigable toil; and the most strenuous diligence
was exerted by the officers of Valens, that not a single Barbarian, of
those who were reserved to subvert the foundations of Rome, should be
left on the opposite shore. It was thought expedient that an accurate
account should be taken of their numbers; but the persons who were
employed soon desisted, with amazement and dismay, from the prosecution
of the endless and impracticable task: <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> and the principal historian
of the age most seriously affirms, that the prodigious armies of Darius
and Xerxes, which had so long been considered as the fables of vain and
credulous antiquity, were now justified, in the eyes of mankind, by
the evidence of fact and experience. A probable testimony has fixed the
number of the Gothic warriors at two hundred thousand men: and if we can
venture to add the just proportion of women, of children, and of slaves,
the whole mass of people which composed this formidable emigration, must
have amounted to near a million of persons, of both sexes, and of all
ages. The children of the Goths, those at least of a distinguished rank,
were separated from the multitude. They were conducted, without delay,
to the distant seats assigned for their residence and education; and as
the numerous train of hostages or captives passed through the cities,
their gay and splendid apparel, their robust and martial figure, excited
the surprise and envy of the Provincials. <a href="#note-6711" name="noteref-6711"><small>6711</small></a> But the stipulation, the
most offensive to the Goths, and the most important to the Romans, was
shamefully eluded. The Barbarians, who considered their arms as the
ensigns of honor and the pledges of safety, were disposed to offer a
price, which the lust or avarice of the Imperial officers was easily
tempted to accept. To preserve their arms, the haughty warriors
consented, with some reluctance, to prostitute their wives or their
daughters; the charms of a beauteous maid, or a comely boy, secured the
connivance of the inspectors; who sometimes cast an eye of covetousness
on the fringed carpets and linen garments of their new allies, <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> or
who sacrificed their duty to the mean consideration of filling their
farms with cattle, and their houses with slaves. The Goths, with arms in
their hands, were permitted to enter the boats; and when their strength
was collected on the other side of the river, the immense camp which
was spread over the plains and the hills of the Lower Maesia, assumed
a threatening and even hostile aspect. The leaders of the Ostrogoths,
Alatheus and Saphrax, the guardians of their infant king, appeared
soon afterwards on the Northern banks of the Danube; and immediately
despatched their ambassadors to the court of Antioch, to solicit, with
the same professions of allegiance and gratitude, the same favor which
had been granted to the suppliant Visigoths. The absolute refusal of
Valens suspended their progress, and discovered the repentance, the
suspicions, and the fears, of the Imperial council.

appears to me to have been misunderstood by M. Mai, to whom we owe its
discovery. The substance is as follows: "The Goths transported over
the river their native deities, with their priests of both sexes; but
concerning their rites they maintained a deep and 'adamantine silence.'
To the Romans they pretended to be generally Christians, and placed
certain persons to represent bishops in a conspicuous manner on their
wagons. There was even among them a sort of what are called monks,
persons whom it was not difficult to mimic; it was enough to wear
black raiment, to be wicked, and held in respect." (Eunapius hated the
"black-robed monks," as appears in another passage, with the cordial
detestation of a heathen philosopher.) "Thus, while they faithfully but
secretly adhered to their own religion, the Romans were weak enough to
suppose them perfect Christians." Mai, 277. Eunapius in Niebuhr, 82.&mdash;M]

</p>
<p>
An undisciplined and unsettled nation of Barbarians required the firmest
temper, and the most dexterous management. The daily subsistence of near
a million of extraordinary subjects could be supplied only by constant
and skilful diligence, and might continually be interrupted by mistake
or accident. The insolence, or the indignation, of the Goths, if they
conceived themselves to be the objects either of fear or of contempt,
might urge them to the most desperate extremities; and the fortune of
the state seemed to depend on the prudence, as well as the integrity,
of the generals of Valens. At this important crisis, the military
government of Thrace was exercised by Lupicinus and Maximus, in whose
venal minds the slightest hope of private emolument outweighed every
consideration of public advantage; and whose guilt was only alleviated
by their incapacity of discerning the pernicious effects of their rash
and criminal administration.
</p>
<p>
Instead of obeying the orders of their sovereign, and satisfying, with
decent liberality, the demands of the Goths, they levied an ungenerous
and oppressive tax on the wants of the hungry Barbarians. The vilest
food was sold at an extravagant price; and, in the room of wholesome and
substantial provisions, the markets were filled with the flesh of dogs,
and of unclean animals, who had died of disease. To obtain the valuable
acquisition of a pound of bread, the Goths resigned the possession of an
expensive, though serviceable, slave; and a small quantity of meat was
greedily purchased with ten pounds of a precious, but useless metal,
<a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> when their property was exhausted, they continued this necessary
traffic by the sale of their sons and daughters; and notwithstanding the
love of freedom, which animated every Gothic breast, they submitted
to the humiliating maxim, that it was better for their children to be
maintained in a servile condition, than to perish in a state of wretched
and helpless independence. The most lively resentment is excited by
the tyranny of pretended benefactors, who sternly exact the debt of
gratitude which they have cancelled by subsequent injuries: a spirit of
discontent insensibly arose in the camp of the Barbarians, who pleaded,
without success, the merit of their patient and dutiful behavior; and
loudly complained of the inhospitable treatment which they had received
from their new allies. They beheld around them the wealth and plenty of
a fertile province, in the midst of which they suffered the intolerable
hardships of artificial famine. But the means of relief, and even of
revenge, were in their hands; since the rapaciousness of their tyrants
had left to an injured people the possession and the use of arms. The
clamors of a multitude, untaught to disguise their sentiments, announced
the first symptoms of resistance, and alarmed the timid and guilty minds
of Lupicinus and Maximus. Those crafty ministers, who substituted the
cunning of temporary expedients to the wise and salutary counsels of
general policy, attempted to remove the Goths from their dangerous
station on the frontiers of the empire; and to disperse them, in
separate quarters of cantonment, through the interior provinces. As they
were conscious how ill they had deserved the respect, or confidence, of
the Barbarians, they diligently collected, from every side, a military
force, that might urge the tardy and reluctant march of a people, who
had not yet renounced the title, or the duties, of Roman subjects. But
the generals of Valens, while their attention was solely directed to
the discontented Visigoths, imprudently disarmed the ships and the
fortifications which constituted the defence of the Danube. The fatal
oversight was observed, and improved, by Alatheus and Saphrax, who
anxiously watched the favorable moment of escaping from the pursuit
of the Huns. By the help of such rafts and vessels as could be hastily
procured, the leaders of the Ostrogoths transported, without opposition,
their king and their army; and boldly fixed a hostile and independent
camp on the territories of the empire. <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a>

Under the name of Judges, Alavivus and Fritigern were the leaders of the
Visigoths in peace and war; and the authority which they derived from
their birth was ratified by the free consent of the nation. In a season
of tranquility, their power might have been equal, as well as their
rank; but, as soon as their countrymen were exasperated by hunger and
oppression, the superior abilities of Fritigern assumed the military
command, which he was qualified to exercise for the public welfare. He
restrained the impatient spirit of the Visigoths till the injuries and
the insults of their tyrants should justify their resistance in the
opinion of mankind: but he was not disposed to sacrifice any solid
advantages for the empty praise of justice and moderation. Sensible
of the benefits which would result from the union of the Gothic powers
under the same standard, he secretly cultivated the friendship of the
Ostrogoths; and while he professed an implicit obedience to the
orders of the Roman generals, he proceeded by slow marches towards
Marcianopolis, the capital of the Lower Maesia, about seventy miles from
the banks of the Danube. On that fatal spot, the flames of discord and
mutual hatred burst forth into a dreadful conflagration. Lupicinus had
invited the Gothic chiefs to a splendid entertainment; and their martial
train remained under arms at the entrance of the palace. But the gates
of the city were strictly guarded, and the Barbarians were sternly
excluded from the use of a plentiful market, to which they asserted
their equal claim of subjects and allies. Their humble prayers were
rejected with insolence and derision; and as their patience was now
exhausted, the townsmen, the soldiers, and the Goths, were soon involved
in a conflict of passionate altercation and angry reproaches. A blow was
imprudently given; a sword was hastily drawn; and the first blood that
was spilt in this accidental quarrel, became the signal of a long
and destructive war. In the midst of noise and brutal intemperance,
Lupicinus was informed, by a secret messenger, that many of his soldiers
were slain, and despoiled of their arms; and as he was already inflamed
by wine, and oppressed by sleep he issued a rash command, that their
death should be revenged by the massacre of the guards of Fritigern and
Alavivus.
</p>
<p>
The clamorous shouts and dying groans apprised Fritigern of his extreme
danger; and, as he possessed the calm and intrepid spirit of a hero, he
saw that he was lost if he allowed a moment of deliberation to the man
who had so deeply injured him. "A trifling dispute," said the Gothic
leader, with a firm but gentle tone of voice, "appears to have arisen
between the two nations; but it may be productive of the most dangerous
consequences, unless the tumult is immediately pacified by the assurance
of our safety, and the authority of our presence." At these words,
Fritigern and his companions drew their swords, opened their passage
through the unresisting crowd, which filled the palace, the streets,
and the gates, of Marcianopolis, and, mounting their horses, hastily
vanished from the eyes of the astonished Romans. The generals of the
Goths were saluted by the fierce and joyful acclamations of the camp;
war was instantly resolved, and the resolution was executed without
delay: the banners of the nation were displayed according to the custom
of their ancestors; and the air resounded with the harsh and mournful
music of the Barbarian trumpet. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> The weak and guilty Lupicinus,
who had dared to provoke, who had neglected to destroy, and who still
presumed to despise, his formidable enemy, marched against the Goths, at
the head of such a military force as could be collected on this sudden
emergency. The Barbarians expected his approach about nine miles from
Marcianopolis; and on this occasion the talents of the general were
found to be of more prevailing efficacy than the weapons and discipline
of the troops. The valor of the Goths was so ably directed by the genius
of Fritigern, that they broke, by a close and vigorous attack, the
ranks of the Roman legions. Lupicinus left his arms and standards, his
tribunes and his bravest soldiers, on the field of battle; and their
useless courage served only to protect the ignominious flight of
their leader. "That successful day put an end to the distress of the
Barbarians, and the security of the Romans: from that day, the Goths,
renouncing the precarious condition of strangers and exiles, assumed the
character of citizens and masters, claimed an absolute dominion over the
possessors of land, and held, in their own right, the northern provinces
of the empire, which are bounded by the Danube." Such are the words
of the Gothic historian, <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> who celebrates, with rude eloquence,
the glory of his countrymen. But the dominion of the Barbarians was
exercised only for the purposes of rapine and destruction. As they had
been deprived, by the ministers of the emperor, of the common benefits
of nature, and the fair intercourse of social life, they retaliated the
injustice on the subjects of the empire; and the crimes of Lupicinus
were expiated by the ruin of the peaceful husbandmen of Thrace, the
conflagration of their villages, and the massacre, or captivity, of
their innocent families. The report of the Gothic victory was soon
diffused over the adjacent country; and while it filled the minds of the
Romans with terror and dismay, their own hasty imprudence contributed
to increase the forces of Fritigern, and the calamities of the province.
Some time before the great emigration, a numerous body of Goths, under
the command of Suerid and Colias, had been received into the protection
and service of the empire. <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> They were encamped under the walls of
Hadrianople; but the ministers of Valens were anxious to remove them
beyond the Hellespont, at a distance from the dangerous temptation which
might so easily be communicated by the neighborhood, and the success, of
their countrymen. The respectful submission with which they yielded
to the order of their march, might be considered as a proof of their
fidelity; and their moderate request of a sufficient allowance of
provisions, and of a delay of only two days was expressed in the most
dutiful terms. But the first magistrate of Hadrianople, incensed by some
disorders which had been committed at his country-house, refused this
indulgence; and arming against them the inhabitants and manufacturers
of a populous city, he urged, with hostile threats, their instant
departure. The Barbarians stood silent and amazed, till they were
exasperated by the insulting clamors, and missile weapons, of the
populace: but when patience or contempt was fatigued, they crushed the
undisciplined multitude, inflicted many a shameful wound on the backs
of their flying enemies, and despoiled them of the splendid armor, <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a>
which they were unworthy to bear. The resemblance of their sufferings
and their actions soon united this victorious detachment to the nation
of the Visigoths; the troops of Colias and Suerid expected the approach
of the great Fritigern, ranged themselves under his standard, and
signalized their ardor in the siege of Hadrianople. But the resistance
of the garrison informed the Barbarians, that in the attack of regular
fortifications, the efforts of unskillful courage are seldom effectual.
Their general acknowledged his error, raised the siege, declared that
"he was at peace with stone walls," <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> and revenged his disappointment
on the adjacent country. He accepted, with pleasure, the useful
reenforcement of hardy workmen, who labored in the gold mines of Thrace,
<a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a> for the emolument, and under the lash, of an unfeeling master: <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a>
and these new associates conducted the Barbarians, through the secret
paths, to the most sequestered places, which had been chosen to secure
the inhabitants, the cattle, and the magazines of corn. With the
assistance of such guides, nothing could remain impervious or
inaccessible; resistance was fatal; flight was impracticable; and the
patient submission of helpless innocence seldom found mercy from the
Barbarian conqueror. In the course of these depredations, a great number
of the children of the Goths, who had been sold into captivity, were
restored to the embraces of their afflicted parents; but these tender
interviews, which might have revived and cherished in their minds some
sentiments of humanity, tended only to stimulate their native fierceness
by the desire of revenge. They listened, with eager attention, to the
complaints of their captive children, who had suffered the most cruel
indignities from the lustful or angry passions of their masters, and the
same cruelties, the same indignities, were severely retaliated on the
sons and daughters of the Romans. <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The imprudence of Valens and his ministers had introduced into the heart
of the empire a nation of enemies; but the Visigoths might even yet have
been reconciled, by the manly confession of past errors, and the sincere
performance of former engagements. These healing and temperate measures
seemed to concur with the timorous disposition of the sovereign of
the East: but, on this occasion alone, Valens was brave; and his
unseasonable bravery was fatal to himself and to his subjects. He
declared his intention of marching from Antioch to Constantinople, to
subdue this dangerous rebellion; and, as he was not ignorant of the
difficulties of the enterprise, he solicited the assistance of his
nephew, the emperor Gratian, who commanded all the forces of the West.
The veteran troops were hastily recalled from the defence of Armenia;
that important frontier was abandoned to the discretion of Sapor;
and the immediate conduct of the Gothic war was intrusted, during
the absence of Valens, to his lieutenants Trajan and Profuturus, two
generals who indulged themselves in a very false and favorable opinion
of their own abilities. On their arrival in Thrace, they were joined by
Richomer, count of the domestics; and the auxiliaries of the West, that
marched under his banner, were composed of the Gallic legions, reduced
indeed, by a spirit of desertion, to the vain appearances of strength
and numbers. In a council of war, which was influenced by pride,
rather than by reason, it was resolved to seek, and to encounter, the
Barbarians, who lay encamped in the spacious and fertile meadows, near
the most southern of the six mouths of the Danube. <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> Their camp
was surrounded by the usual fortification of wagons; <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> and the
Barbarians, secure within the vast circle of the enclosure, enjoyed the
fruits of their valor, and the spoils of the province. In the midst of
riotous intemperance, the watchful Fritigern observed the motions, and
penetrated the designs, of the Romans. He perceived, that the numbers
of the enemy were continually increasing: and, as he understood their
intention of attacking his rear, as soon as the scarcity of forage
should oblige him to remove his camp, he recalled to their standard his
predatory detachments, which covered the adjacent country. As soon as
they descried the flaming beacons, <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> they obeyed, with incredible
speed, the signal of their leader: the camp was filled with the martial
crowd of Barbarians; their impatient clamors demanded the battle, and
their tumultuous zeal was approved and animated by the spirit of
their chiefs. The evening was already far advanced; and the two armies
prepared themselves for the approaching combat, which was deferred only
till the dawn of day.
</p>
<p>
While the trumpets sounded to arms, the undaunted courage of the Goths
was confirmed by the mutual obligation of a solemn oath; and as they
advanced to meet the enemy, the rude songs, which celebrated the glory
of their forefathers, were mingled with their fierce and dissonant
outcries, and opposed to the artificial harmony of the Roman shout. Some
military skill was displayed by Fritigern to gain the advantage of a
commanding eminence; but the bloody conflict, which began and ended with
the light, was maintained on either side, by the personal and obstinate
efforts of strength, valor, and agility. The legions of Armenia
supported their fame in arms; but they were oppressed by the
irresistible weight of the hostile multitude the left wing of the Romans
was thrown into disorder and the field was strewed with their mangled
carcasses. This partial defeat was balanced, however, by partial
success; and when the two armies, at a late hour of the evening,
retreated to their respective camps, neither of them could claim the
honors, or the effects, of a decisive victory. The real loss was more
severely felt by the Romans, in proportion to the smallness of their
numbers; but the Goths were so deeply confounded and dismayed by this
vigorous, and perhaps unexpected, resistance, that they remained seven
days within the circle of their fortifications. Such funeral rites, as
the circumstances of time and place would admit, were piously discharged
to some officers of distinguished rank; but the indiscriminate vulgar
was left unburied on the plain. Their flesh was greedily devoured by
the birds of prey, who in that age enjoyed very frequent and delicious
feasts; and several years afterwards the white and naked bones, which
covered the wide extent of the fields, presented to the eyes of Ammianus
a dreadful monument of the battle of Salices. <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The progress of the Goths had been checked by the doubtful event of
that bloody day; and the Imperial generals, whose army would have been
consumed by the repetition of such a contest, embraced the more rational
plan of destroying the Barbarians by the wants and pressure of their own
multitudes. They prepared to confine the Visigoths in the narrow angle
of land between the Danube, the desert of Scythia, and the mountains of
Haemus, till their strength and spirit should be insensibly wasted by
the inevitable operation of famine. The design was prosecuted with
some conduct and success: the Barbarians had almost exhausted their
own magazines, and the harvests of the country; and the diligence of
Saturninus, the master-general of the cavalry, was employed to improve
the strength, and to contract the extent, of the Roman fortifications.
His labors were interrupted by the alarming intelligence, that new
swarms of Barbarians had passed the unguarded Danube, either to
support the cause, or to imitate the example, of Fritigern. The just
apprehension, that he himself might be surrounded, and overwhelmed,
by the arms of hostile and unknown nations, compelled Saturninus to
relinquish the siege of the Gothic camp; and the indignant Visigoths,
breaking from their confinement, satiated their hunger and revenge by
the repeated devastation of the fruitful country, which extends above
three hundred miles from the banks of the Danube to the straits of the
Hellespont. <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> The sagacious Fritigern had successfully appealed to
the passions, as well as to the interest, of his Barbarian allies; and
the love of rapine, and the hatred of Rome, seconded, or even prevented,
the eloquence of his ambassadors. He cemented a strict and useful
alliance with the great body of his countrymen, who obeyed Alatheus and
Saphrax as the guardians of their infant king: the long animosity of
rival tribes was suspended by the sense of their common interest; the
independent part of the nation was associated under one standard; and
the chiefs of the Ostrogoths appear to have yielded to the superior
genius of the general of the Visigoths. He obtained the formidable aid
of the Taifalae, <a href="#note-8311" name="noteref-8311"><small>8311</small></a> whose military renown was disgraced and polluted
by the public infamy of their domestic manners. Every youth, on his
entrance into the world, was united by the ties of honorable friendship,
and brutal love, to some warrior of the tribe; nor could he hope to
be released from this unnatural connection, till he had approved his
manhood by slaying, in single combat, a huge bear, or a wild boar of the
forest. <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> But the most powerful auxiliaries of the Goths were drawn
from the camp of those enemies who had expelled them from their native
seats. The loose subordination, and extensive possessions, of the Huns
and the Alani, delayed the conquests, and distracted the councils, of
that victorious people. Several of the hords were allured by the liberal
promises of Fritigern; and the rapid cavalry of Scythia added weight and
energy to the steady and strenuous efforts of the Gothic infantry.
The Sarmatians, who could never forgive the successor of Valentinian,
enjoyed and increased the general confusion; and a seasonable irruption
of the Alemanni, into the provinces of Gaul, engaged the attention, and
diverted the forces, of the emperor of the West. <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXVI: Progress of The Huns.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
One of the most dangerous inconveniences of the introduction of the
Barbarians into the army and the palace, was sensibly felt in their
correspondence with their hostile countrymen; to whom they imprudently,
or maliciously, revealed the weakness of the Roman empire. A soldier, of
the lifeguards of Gratian, was of the nation of the Alemanni, and of the
tribe of the Lentienses, who dwelt beyond the Lake of Constance. Some
domestic business obliged him to request a leave of absence. In a
short visit to his family and friends, he was exposed to their curious
inquiries: and the vanity of the loquacious soldier tempted him to
display his intimate acquaintance with the secrets of the state, and the
designs of his master. The intelligence, that Gratian was preparing to
lead the military force of Gaul, and of the West, to the assistance of
his uncle Valens, pointed out to the restless spirit of the Alemanni the
moment, and the mode, of a successful invasion. The enterprise of some
light detachments, who, in the month of February, passed the Rhine upon
the ice, was the prelude of a more important war. The boldest hopes
of rapine, perhaps of conquest, outweighed the considerations of timid
prudence, or national faith. Every forest, and every village, poured
forth a band of hardy adventurers; and the great army of the Alemanni,
which, on their approach, was estimated at forty thousand men by the
fears of the people, was afterwards magnified to the number of seventy
thousand by the vain and credulous flattery of the Imperial court. The
legions, which had been ordered to march into Pannonia, were immediately
recalled, or detained, for the defence of Gaul; the military command
was divided between Nanienus and Mellobaudes; and the youthful emperor,
though he respected the long experience and sober wisdom of the former,
was much more inclined to admire, and to follow, the martial ardor of
his colleague; who was allowed to unite the incompatible characters of
count of the domestics, and of king of the Franks. His rival Priarius,
king of the Alemanni, was guided, or rather impelled, by the same
headstrong valor; and as their troops were animated by the spirit of
their leaders, they met, they saw, they encountered each other, near the
town of Argentaria, or Colmar, <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> in the plains of Alsace. The
glory of the day was justly ascribed to the missile weapons, and
well-practised evolutions, of the Roman soldiers; the Alemanni, who long
maintained their ground, were slaughtered with unrelenting fury; five
thousand only of the Barbarians escaped to the woods and mountains; and
the glorious death of their king on the field of battle saved him from
the reproaches of the people, who are always disposed to accuse the
justice, or policy, of an unsuccessful war. After this signal victory,
which secured the peace of Gaul, and asserted the honor of the Roman
arms, the emperor Gratian appeared to proceed without delay on his
Eastern expedition; but as he approached the confines of the Alemanni,
he suddenly inclined to the left, surprised them by his unexpected
passage of the Rhine, and boldly advanced into the heart of their
country. The Barbarians opposed to his progress the obstacles of
nature and of courage; and still continued to retreat, from one hill to
another, till they were satisfied, by repeated trials, of the power and
perseverance of their enemies. Their submission was accepted as a proof,
not indeed of their sincere repentance, but of their actual distress;
and a select number of their brave and robust youth was exacted from
the faithless nation, as the most substantial pledge of their future
moderation. The subjects of the empire, who had so often experienced
that the Alemanni could neither be subdued by arms, nor restrained
by treaties, might not promise themselves any solid or lasting
tranquillity: but they discovered, in the virtues of their young
sovereign, the prospect of a long and auspicious reign. When the legions
climbed the mountains, and scaled the fortifications of the Barbarians,
the valor of Gratian was distinguished in the foremost ranks; and the
gilt and variegated armor of his guards was pierced and shattered by the
blows which they had received in their constant attachment to the person
of their sovereign. At the age of nineteen, the son of Valentinian
seemed to possess the talents of peace and war; and his personal success
against the Alemanni was interpreted as a sure presage of his Gothic
triumphs. <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a>

</p>
<p>
While Gratian deserved and enjoyed the applause of his subjects, the
emperor Valens, who, at length, had removed his court and army from
Antioch, was received by the people of Constantinople as the author
of the public calamity. Before he had reposed himself ten days in the
capital, he was urged by the licentious clamors of the Hippodrome to
march against the Barbarians, whom he had invited into his dominions;
and the citizens, who are always brave at a distance from any real
danger, declared, with confidence, that, if they were supplied with
arms, they alone would undertake to deliver the province from the
ravages of an insulting foe. <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> The vain reproaches of an ignorant
multitude hastened the downfall of the Roman empire; they provoked the
desperate rashness of Valens; who did not find, either in his reputation
or in his mind, any motives to support with firmness the public
contempt. He was soon persuaded, by the successful achievements of his
lieutenants, to despise the power of the Goths, who, by the diligence
of Fritigern, were now collected in the neighborhood of Hadrianople. The
march of the Taifalae had been intercepted by the valiant Frigeric:
the king of those licentious Barbarians was slain in battle; and the
suppliant captives were sent into distant exile to cultivate the
lands of Italy, which were assigned for their settlement in the vacant
territories of Modena and Parma. <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> The exploits of Sebastian, <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a>
who was recently engaged in the service of Valens, and promoted to the
rank of master-general of the infantry, were still more honorable to
himself, and useful to the republic. He obtained the permission of
selecting three hundred soldiers from each of the legions; and this
separate detachment soon acquired the spirit of discipline, and the
exercise of arms, which were almost forgotten under the reign of Valens.
By the vigor and conduct of Sebastian, a large body of the Goths were
surprised in their camp; and the immense spoil, which was recovered from
their hands, filled the city of Hadrianople, and the adjacent plain. The
splendid narratives, which the general transmitted of his own exploits,
alarmed the Imperial court by the appearance of superior merit; and
though he cautiously insisted on the difficulties of the Gothic war,
his valor was praised, his advice was rejected; and Valens, who listened
with pride and pleasure to the flattering suggestions of the eunuchs
of the palace, was impatient to seize the glory of an easy and assured
conquest. His army was strengthened by a numerous reenforcement of
veterans; and his march from Constantinople to Hadrianople was conducted
with so much military skill, that he prevented the activity of the
Barbarians, who designed to occupy the intermediate defiles, and to
intercept either the troops themselves, or their convoys of provisions.
The camp of Valens, which he pitched under the walls of Hadrianople,
was fortified, according to the practice of the Romans, with a ditch and
rampart; and a most important council was summoned, to decide the fate
of the emperor and of the empire. The party of reason and of delay was
strenuously maintained by Victor, who had corrected, by the lessons
of experience, the native fierceness of the Sarmatian character; while
Sebastian, with the flexible and obsequious eloquence of a courtier,
represented every precaution, and every measure, that implied a doubt
of immediate victory, as unworthy of the courage and majesty of their
invincible monarch. The ruin of Valens was precipitated by the deceitful
arts of Fritigern, and the prudent admonitions of the emperor of the
West. The advantages of negotiating in the midst of war were
perfectly understood by the general of the Barbarians; and a Christian
ecclesiastic was despatched, as the holy minister of peace, to
penetrate, and to perplex, the councils of the enemy. The misfortunes,
as well as the provocations, of the Gothic nation, were forcibly and
truly described by their ambassador; who protested, in the name of
Fritigern, that he was still disposed to lay down his arms, or to employ
them only in the defence of the empire; if he could secure for his
wandering countrymen a tranquil settlement on the waste lands of Thrace,
and a sufficient allowance of corn and cattle. But he added, in a
whisper of confidential friendship, that the exasperated Barbarians were
averse to these reasonable conditions; and that Fritigern was doubtful
whether he could accomplish the conclusion of the treaty, unless he
found himself supported by the presence and terrors of an Imperial army.
About the same time, Count Richomer returned from the West to announce
the defeat and submission of the Alemanni, to inform Valens that
his nephew advanced by rapid marches at the head of the veteran and
victorious legions of Gaul, and to request, in the name of Gratian and
of the republic, that every dangerous and decisive measure might be
suspended, till the junction of the two emperors should insure the
success of the Gothic war. But the feeble sovereign of the East was
actuated only by the fatal illusions of pride and jealousy. He disdained
the importunate advice; he rejected the humiliating aid; he secretly
compared the ignominious, at least the inglorious, period of his own
reign, with the fame of a beardless youth; and Valens rushed into
the field, to erect his imaginary trophy, before the diligence of his
colleague could usurp any share of the triumphs of the day.

On the ninth of August, a day which has deserved to be marked among
the most inauspicious of the Roman Calendar, <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a> the emperor Valens,
leaving, under a strong guard, his baggage and military treasure,
marched from Hadrianople to attack the Goths, who were encamped about
twelve miles from the city. <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> By some mistake of the orders, or some
ignorance of the ground, the right wing, or column of cavalry arrived
in sight of the enemy, whilst the left was still at a considerable
distance; the soldiers were compelled, in the sultry heat of summer, to
precipitate their pace; and the line of battle was formed with tedious
confusion and irregular delay. The Gothic cavalry had been detached
to forage in the adjacent country; and Fritigern still continued to
practise his customary arts. He despatched messengers of peace, made
proposals, required hostages, and wasted the hours, till the Romans,
exposed without shelter to the burning rays of the sun, were exhausted
by thirst, hunger, and intolerable fatigue. The emperor was persuaded to
send an ambassador to the Gothic camp; the zeal of Richomer, who alone
had courage to accept the dangerous commission, was applauded; and
the count of the domestics, adorned with the splendid ensigns of his
dignity, had proceeded some way in the space between the two armies,
when he was suddenly recalled by the alarm of battle. The hasty and
imprudent attack was made by Bacurius the Iberian, who commanded a body
of archers and targeteers; and as they advanced with rashness, they
retreated with loss and disgrace. In the same moment, the flying
squadrons of Alatheus and Saphrax, whose return was anxiously expected
by the general of the Goths, descended like a whirlwind from the hills,
swept across the plain, and added new terrors to the tumultuous, but
irresistible charge of the Barbarian host. The event of the battle of
Hadrianople, so fatal to Valens and to the empire, may be described in
a few words: the Roman cavalry fled; the infantry was abandoned,
surrounded, and cut in pieces. The most skilful evolutions, the
firmest courage, are scarcely sufficient to extricate a body of foot,
encompassed, on an open plain, by superior numbers of horse; but the
troops of Valens, oppressed by the weight of the enemy and their own
fears, were crowded into a narrow space, where it was impossible for
them to extend their ranks, or even to use, with effect, their swords
and javelins. In the midst of tumult, of slaughter, and of dismay, the
emperor, deserted by his guards and wounded, as it was supposed, with
an arrow, sought protection among the Lancearii and the Mattiarii,
who still maintained their ground with some appearance of order and
firmness. His faithful generals, Trajan and Victor, who perceived his
danger, loudly exclaimed that all was lost, unless the person of the
emperor could be saved. Some troops, animated by their exhortation,
advanced to his relief: they found only a bloody spot, covered with a
heap of broken arms and mangled bodies, without being able to discover
their unfortunate prince, either among the living or the dead. Their
search could not indeed be successful, if there is any truth in the
circumstances with which some historians have related the death of the
emperor.
</p>
<p>
By the care of his attendants, Valens was removed from the field of
battle to a neighboring cottage, where they attempted to dress his
wound, and to provide for his future safety. But this humble retreat was
instantly surrounded by the enemy: they tried to force the door, they
were provoked by a discharge of arrows from the roof, till at length,
impatient of delay, they set fire to a pile of dry magots, and consumed
the cottage with the Roman emperor and his train. Valens perished in
the flames; and a youth, who dropped from the window, alone escaped, to
attest the melancholy tale, and to inform the Goths of the inestimable
prize which they had lost by their own rashness. A great number of brave
and distinguished officers perished in the battle of Hadrianople,
which equalled in the actual loss, and far surpassed in the fatal
consequences, the misfortune which Rome had formerly sustained in the
fields of Cannae. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> Two master-generals of the cavalry and infantry,
two great officers of the palace, and thirty-five tribunes, were found
among the slain; and the death of Sebastian might satisfy the world,
that he was the victim, as well as the author, of the public calamity.
Above two thirds of the Roman army were destroyed: and the darkness of
the night was esteemed a very favorable circumstance, as it served to
conceal the flight of the multitude, and to protect the more orderly
retreat of Victor and Richomer, who alone, amidst the general
consternation, maintained the advantage of calm courage and regular
discipline. <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a>

While the impressions of grief and terror were still recent in the minds
of men, the most celebrated rhetorician of the age composed the funeral
oration of a vanquished army, and of an unpopular prince, whose throne
was already occupied by a stranger. "There are not wanting," says the
candid Libanius, "those who arraign the prudence of the emperor, or who
impute the public misfortune to the want of courage and discipline in
the troops. For my own part, I reverence the memory of their former
exploits: I reverence the glorious death, which they bravely received,
standing, and fighting in their ranks: I reverence the field of battle,
stained with their blood, and the blood of the Barbarians. Those
honorable marks have been already washed away by the rains; but the
lofty monuments of their bones, the bones of generals, of centurions,
and of valiant warriors, claim a longer period of duration. The king
himself fought and fell in the foremost ranks of the battle. His
attendants presented him with the fleetest horses of the Imperial
stable, that would soon have carried him beyond the pursuit of the
enemy. They vainly pressed him to reserve his important life for the
future service of the republic. He still declared that he was unworthy
to survive so many of the bravest and most faithful of his subjects; and
the monarch was nobly buried under a mountain of the slain. Let none,
therefore, presume to ascribe the victory of the Barbarians to the fear,
the weakness, or the imprudence, of the Roman troops. The chiefs and
the soldiers were animated by the virtue of their ancestors, whom they
equalled in discipline and the arts of war. Their generous emulation was
supported by the love of glory, which prompted them to contend at the
same time with heat and thirst, with fire and the sword; and cheerfully
to embrace an honorable death, as their refuge against flight and
infamy. The indignation of the gods has been the only cause of the
success of our enemies." The truth of history may disclaim some parts of
this panegyric, which cannot strictly be reconciled with the character
of Valens, or the circumstances of the battle: but the fairest
commendation is due to the eloquence, and still more to the generosity,
of the sophist of Antioch. <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a>

The pride of the Goths was elated by this memorable victory; but their
avarice was disappointed by the mortifying discovery, that the richest
part of the Imperial spoil had been within the walls of Hadrianople.
They hastened to possess the reward of their valor; but they were
encountered by the remains of a vanquished army, with an intrepid
resolution, which was the effect of their despair, and the only hope of
their safety. The walls of the city, and the ramparts of the adjacent
camp, were lined with military engines, that threw stones of an enormous
weight; and astonished the ignorant Barbarians by the noise, and
velocity, still more than by the real effects, of the discharge. The
soldiers, the citizens, the provincials, the domestics of the palace,
were united in the danger, and in the defence: the furious assault of
the Goths was repulsed; their secret arts of treachery and treason were
discovered; and, after an obstinate conflict of many hours, they retired
to their tents; convinced, by experience, that it would be far more
advisable to observe the treaty, which their sagacious leader had
tacitly stipulated with the fortifications of great and populous cities.
After the hasty and impolitic massacre of three hundred deserters, an
act of justice extremely useful to the discipline of the Roman armies,
the Goths indignantly raised the siege of Hadrianople. The scene of war
and tumult was instantly converted into a silent solitude: the multitude
suddenly disappeared; the secret paths of the woods and mountains were
marked with the footsteps of the trembling fugitives, who sought
a refuge in the distant cities of Illyricum and Macedonia; and the
faithful officers of the household, and the treasury, cautiously
proceeded in search of the emperor, of whose death they were still
ignorant. The tide of the Gothic inundation rolled from the walls
of Hadrianople to the suburbs of Constantinople. The Barbarians were
surprised with the splendid appearance of the capital of the East, the
height and extent of the walls, the myriads of wealthy and affrighted
citizens who crowded the ramparts, and the various prospect of the sea
and land. While they gazed with hopeless desire on the inaccessible
beauties of Constantinople, a sally was made from one of the gates by a
party of Saracens, <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> who had been fortunately engaged in the service
of Valens. The cavalry of Scythia was forced to yield to the admirable
swiftness and spirit of the Arabian horses: their riders were skilled
in the evolutions of irregular war; and the Northern Barbarians were
astonished and dismayed, by the inhuman ferocity of the Barbarians of
the South.

A Gothic soldier was slain by the dagger of an Arab; and the hairy,
naked savage, applying his lips to the wound, expressed a horrid

army of the Goths, laden with the spoils of the wealthy suburbs and the
adjacent territory, slowly moved, from the Bosphorus, to the mountains
which form the western boundary of Thrace. The important pass of
Succi was betrayed by the fear, or the misconduct, of Maurus; and the
Barbarians, who no longer had any resistance to apprehend from the
scattered and vanquished troops of the East, spread themselves over
the face of a fertile and cultivated country, as far as the confines of
Italy and the Hadriatic Sea. <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a>

The Romans, who so coolly, and so concisely, mention the acts of justice
which were exercised by the legions, <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> reserve their compassion,
and their eloquence, for their own sufferings, when the provinces were
invaded, and desolated, by the arms of the successful Barbarians. The
simple circumstantial narrative (did such a narrative exist) of the ruin
of a single town, of the misfortunes of a single family, <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> might
exhibit an interesting and instructive picture of human manners: but the
tedious repetition of vague and declamatory complaints would fatigue the
attention of the most patient reader. The same censure may be applied,
though not perhaps in an equal degree, to the profane, and the
ecclesiastical, writers of this unhappy period; that their minds were
inflamed by popular and religious animosity; and that the true size and
color of every object is falsified by the exaggerations of their corrupt
eloquence. The vehement Jerom <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> might justly deplore the calamities
inflicted by the Goths, and their barbarous allies, on his native
country of Pannonia, and the wide extent of the provinces, from the
walls of Constantinople to the foot of the Julian Alps; the rapes, the
massacres, the conflagrations; and, above all, the profanation of the
churches, that were turned into stables, and the contemptuous treatment
of the relics of holy martyrs. But the Saint is surely transported
beyond the limits of nature and history, when he affirms, "that, in
those desert countries, nothing was left except the sky and the earth;
that, after the destruction of the cities, and the extirpation of the
human race, the land was overgrown with thick forests and inextricable
brambles; and that the universal desolation, announced by the prophet
Zephaniah, was accomplished, in the scarcity of the beasts, the birds,
and even of the fish." These complaints were pronounced about twenty
years after the death of Valens; and the Illyrian provinces, which were
constantly exposed to the invasion and passage of the Barbarians, still
continued, after a calamitous period of ten centuries, to supply new
materials for rapine and destruction. Could it even be supposed, that
a large tract of country had been left without cultivation and without
inhabitants, the consequences might not have been so fatal to the
inferior productions of animated nature. The useful and feeble animals,
which are nourished by the hand of man, might suffer and perish, if
they were deprived of his protection; but the beasts of the forest,
his enemies or his victims, would multiply in the free and undisturbed
possession of their solitary domain. The various tribes that people the
air, or the waters, are still less connected with the fate of the human
species; and it is highly probable that the fish of the Danube would
have felt more terror and distress, from the approach of a voracious
pike, than from the hostile inroad of a Gothic army.

Whatever may have been the just measure of the calamities of Europe,
there was reason to fear that the same calamities would soon extend
to the peaceful countries of Asia. The sons of the Goths had been
judiciously distributed through the cities of the East; and the arts of
education were employed to polish, and subdue, the native fierceness
of their temper. In the space of about twelve years, their numbers had
continually increased; and the children, who, in the first emigration,
were sent over the Hellespont, had attained, with rapid growth, the
strength and spirit of perfect manhood. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> It was impossible to
conceal from their knowledge the events of the Gothic war; and, as
those daring youths had not studied the language of dissimulation, they
betrayed their wish, their desire, perhaps their intention, to emulate
the glorious example of their fathers The danger of the times seemed to
justify the jealous suspicions of the provincials; and these suspicions
were admitted as unquestionable evidence, that the Goths of Asia had
formed a secret and dangerous conspiracy against the public safety. The
death of Valens had left the East without a sovereign; and Julius, who
filled the important station of master-general of the troops, with a
high reputation of diligence and ability, thought it his duty to consult
the senate of Constantinople; which he considered, during the vacancy of
the throne, as the representative council of the nation. As soon as he
had obtained the discretionary power of acting as he should judge most
expedient for the good of the republic, he assembled the principal
officers, and privately concerted effectual measures for the execution
of his bloody design. An order was immediately promulgated, that, on a
stated day, the Gothic youth should assemble in the capital cities
of their respective provinces; and, as a report was industriously
circulated, that they were summoned to receive a liberal gift of lands
and money, the pleasing hope allayed the fury of their resentment, and,
perhaps, suspended the motions of the conspiracy. On the appointed day,
the unarmed crowd of the Gothic youth was carefully collected in the
square or Forum; the streets and avenues were occupied by the Roman
troops, and the roofs of the houses were covered with archers and
slingers. At the same hour, in all the cities of the East, the signal
was given of indiscriminate slaughter; and the provinces of Asia were
delivered by the cruel prudence of Julius, from a domestic enemy, who,
in a few months, might have carried fire and sword from the Hellespont
to the Euphrates. <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a> The urgent consideration of the public safety
may undoubtedly authorize the violation of every positive law. How far
that, or any other, consideration may operate to dissolve the natural
obligations of humanity and justice, is a doctrine of which I still
desire to remain ignorant.

The emperor Gratian was far advanced on his march towards the plains
of Hadrianople, when he was informed, at first by the confused voice
of fame, and afterwards by the more accurate reports of Victor and
Richomer, that his impatient colleague had been slain in battle, and
that two thirds of the Roman army were exterminated by the sword of the
victorious Goths. Whatever resentment the rash and jealous vanity of his
uncle might deserve, the resentment of a generous mind is easily subdued
by the softer emotions of grief and compassion; and even the sense of
pity was soon lost in the serious and alarming consideration of the
state of the republic. Gratian was too late to assist, he was too weak
to revenge, his unfortunate colleague; and the valiant and modest youth
felt himself unequal to the support of a sinking world. A formidable
tempest of the Barbarians of Germany seemed ready to burst over the
provinces of Gaul; and the mind of Gratian was oppressed and distracted
by the administration of the Western empire. In this important crisis,
the government of the East, and the conduct of the Gothic war, required
the undivided attention of a hero and a statesman. A subject invested
with such ample command would not long have preserved his fidelity to a
distant benefactor; and the Imperial council embraced the wise and manly
resolution of conferring an obligation, rather than of yielding to an
insult. It was the wish of Gratian to bestow the purple as the reward
of virtue; but, at the age of nineteen, it is not easy for a prince,
educated in the supreme rank, to understand the true characters of his
ministers and generals. He attempted to weigh, with an impartial hand,
their various merits and defects; and, whilst he checked the rash
confidence of ambition, he distrusted the cautious wisdom which
despaired of the republic. As each moment of delay diminished something
of the power and resources of the future sovereign of the East, the
situation of the times would not allow a tedious debate. The choice of
Gratian was soon declared in favor of an exile, whose father, only three
years before, had suffered, under the sanction of his authority, an
unjust and ignominious death. The great Theodosius, a name celebrated
in history, and dear to the Catholic church, <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> was summoned to
the Imperial court, which had gradually retreated from the confines
of Thrace to the more secure station of Sirmium. Five months after
the death of Valens, the emperor Gratian produced before the assembled
troops his colleague and their master; who, after a modest, perhaps
a sincere, resistance, was compelled to accept, amidst the general
acclamations, the diadem, the purple, and the equal title of Augustus.
<a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a> The provinces of Thrace, Asia, and Egypt, over which Valens had
reigned, were resigned to the administration of the new emperor; but,
as he was specially intrusted with the conduct of the Gothic war, the
Illyrian praefecture was dismembered; and the two great dioceses of
Dacia and Macedonia were added to the dominions of the Eastern empire.

and severe discipline of his father. <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> Under the standard of such a
leader, young Theodosius sought glory and knowledge, in the most distant
scenes of military action; inured his constitution to the difference
of seasons and climates; distinguished his valor by sea and land; and
observed the various warfare of the Scots, the Saxons, and the Moors.
His own merit, and the recommendation of the conqueror of Africa, soon
raised him to a separate command; and, in the station of Duke of Misaea,
he vanquished an army of Sarmatians; saved the province; deserved the
love of the soldiers; and provoked the envy of the court. <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> His
rising fortunes were soon blasted by the disgrace and execution of his
illustrious father; and Theodosius obtained, as a favor, the permission
of retiring to a private life in his native province of Spain. He
displayed a firm and temperate character in the ease with which he
adapted himself to this new situation. His time was almost equally
divided between the town and country; the spirit, which had animated his
public conduct, was shown in the active and affectionate performance
of every social duty; and the diligence of the soldier was profitably
converted to the improvement of his ample patrimony, <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a> which lay
between Valladolid and Segovia, in the midst of a fruitful district,
still famous for a most exquisite breed of sheep. <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> From the
innocent, but humble labors of his farm, Theodosius was transported,
in less than four months, to the throne of the Eastern empire; and
the whole period of the history of the world will not perhaps afford
a similar example, of an elevation at the same time so pure and so
honorable. The princes who peaceably inherit the sceptre of their
fathers, claim and enjoy a legal right, the more secure as it is
absolutely distinct from the merits of their personal characters. The
subjects, who, in a monarchy, or a popular state, acquire the possession
of supreme power, may have raised themselves, by the superiority either
of genius or virtue, above the heads of their equals; but their
virtue is seldom exempt from ambition; and the cause of the successful
candidate is frequently stained by the guilt of conspiracy, or civil
war. Even in those governments which allow the reigning monarch to
declare a colleague or a successor, his partial choice, which may be
influenced by the blindest passions, is often directed to an unworthy
object But the most suspicious malignity cannot ascribe to Theodosius,
in his obscure solitude of Caucha, the arts, the desires, or even the
hopes, of an ambitious statesman; and the name of the Exile would long
since have been forgotten, if his genuine and distinguished virtues had
not left a deep impression in the Imperial court. During the season
of prosperity, he had been neglected; but, in the public distress, his
superior merit was universally felt and acknowledged. What confidence
must have been reposed in his integrity, since Gratian could trust, that
a pious son would forgive, for the sake of the republic, the murder of
his father! What expectations must have been formed of his abilities
to encourage the hope, that a single man could save, and restore, the
empire of the East! Theodosius was invested with the purple in the
thirty-third year of his age. The vulgar gazed with admiration on the
manly beauty of his face, and the graceful majesty of his person, which
they were pleased to compare with the pictures and medals of the emperor
Trajan; whilst intelligent observers discovered, in the qualities of his
heart and understanding, a more important resemblance to the best and
greatest of the Roman princes.

</p>
<p>
It is not without the most sincere regret, that I must now take leave of
an accurate and faithful guide, who has composed the history of his
own times, without indulging the prejudices and passions, which usually
affect the mind of a contemporary. Ammianus Marcellinus, who terminates
his useful work with the defeat and death of Valens, recommends the
more glorious subject of the ensuing reign to the youthful vigor and
eloquence of the rising generation. <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a> The rising generation was not
disposed to accept his advice or to imitate his example; <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> and, in
the study of the reign of Theodosius, we are reduced to illustrate the
partial narrative of Zosimus, by the obscure hints of fragments and
chronicles, by the figurative style of poetry or panegyric, and by the
precarious assistance of the ecclesiastical writers, who, in the heat of
religious faction, are apt to despise the profane virtues of sincerity
and moderation. Conscious of these disadvantages, which will continue
to involve a considerable portion of the decline and fall of the Roman
empire, I shall proceed with doubtful and timorous steps. Yet I may
boldly pronounce, that the battle of Hadrianople was never revenged by
any signal or decisive victory of Theodosius over the Barbarians: and
the expressive silence of his venal orators may be confirmed by the
observation of the condition and circumstances of the times. The fabric
of a mighty state, which has been reared by the labors of successive
ages, could not be overturned by the misfortune of a single day, if the
fatal power of the imagination did not exaggerate the real measure of
the calamity. The loss of forty thousand Romans, who fell in the plains
of Hadrianople, might have been soon recruited in the populous provinces
of the East, which contained so many millions of inhabitants. The
courage of a soldier is found to be the cheapest, and most common,
quality of human nature; and sufficient skill to encounter an
undisciplined foe might have been speedily taught by the care of the
surviving centurions. If the Barbarians were mounted on the horses, and
equipped with the armor, of their vanquished enemies, the numerous studs
of Cappadocia and Spain would have supplied new squadrons of cavalry;
the thirty-four arsenals of the empire were plentifully stored with
magazines of offensive and defensive arms: and the wealth of Asia might
still have yielded an ample fund for the expenses of the war. But the
effects which were produced by the battle of Hadrianople on the minds
of the Barbarians and of the Romans, extended the victory of the former,
and the defeat of the latter, far beyond the limits of a single day. A
Gothic chief was heard to declare, with insolent moderation, that, for
his own part, he was fatigued with slaughter: but that he was astonished
how a people, who fled before him like a flock of sheep, could still
presume to dispute the possession of their treasures and provinces.
<a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a> The same terrors which the name of the Huns had spread among the
Gothic tribes, were inspired, by the formidable name of the Goths, among
the subjects and soldiers of the Roman empire. <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> If Theodosius,
hastily collecting his scattered forces, had led them into the field
to encounter a victorious enemy, his army would have been vanquished
by their own fears; and his rashness could not have been excused by
the chance of success. But the great Theodosius, an epithet which he
honorably deserved on this momentous occasion, conducted himself as the
firm and faithful guardian of the republic. He fixed his head-quarters
at Thessalonica, the capital of the Macedonian diocese; <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> from
whence he could watch the irregular motions of the Barbarians,
and direct the operations of his lieutenants, from the gates of
Constantinople to the shores of the Hadriatic. The fortifications and
garrisons of the cities were strengthened; and the troops, among whom a
sense of order and discipline was revived, were insensibly emboldened
by the confidence of their own safety. From these secure stations, they
were encouraged to make frequent sallies on the Barbarians, who infested
the adjacent country; and, as they were seldom allowed to engage,
without some decisive superiority, either of ground or of numbers, their
enterprises were, for the most part, successful; and they were soon
convinced, by their own experience, of the possibility of vanquishing
their invincible enemies. The detachments of these separate garrisons
were generally united into small armies; the same cautious measures
were pursued, according to an extensive and well-concerted plan of
operations; the events of each day added strength and spirit to the
Roman arms; and the artful diligence of the emperor, who circulated the
most favorable reports of the success of the war, contributed to subdue
the pride of the Barbarians, and to animate the hopes and courage of
his subjects. If, instead of this faint and imperfect outline, we could
accurately represent the counsels and actions of Theodosius, in four
successive campaigns, there is reason to believe, that his consummate
skill would deserve the applause of every military reader. The republic
had formerly been saved by the delays of Fabius; and, while the splendid
trophies of Scipio, in the field of Zama, attract the eyes of posterity,
the camps and marches of the dictator among the hills of the Campania,
may claim a juster proportion of the solid and independent fame, which
the general is not compelled to share, either with fortune or with his
troops. Such was likewise the merit of Theodosius; and the infirmities
of his body, which most unseasonably languished under a long and
dangerous disease, could not oppress the vigor of his mind, or divert
his attention from the public service. <a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The deliverance and peace of the Roman provinces <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a> was the work of
prudence, rather than of valor: the prudence of Theodosius was seconded
by fortune: and the emperor never failed to seize, and to improve, every
favorable circumstance. As long as the superior genius of Fritigern
preserved the union, and directed the motions of the Barbarians, their
power was not inadequate to the conquest of a great empire. The death of
that hero, the predecessor and master of the renowned Alaric, relieved
an impatient multitude from the intolerable yoke of discipline and
discretion. The Barbarians, who had been restrained by his authority,
abandoned themselves to the dictates of their passions; and their
passions were seldom uniform or consistent. An army of conquerors was
broken into many disorderly bands of savage robbers; and their blind
and irregular fury was not less pernicious to themselves, than to their
enemies. Their mischievous disposition was shown in the destruction of
every object which they wanted strength to remove, or taste to enjoy;
and they often consumed, with improvident rage, the harvests, or
the granaries, which soon afterwards became necessary for their own
subsistence. A spirit of discord arose among the independent tribes
and nations, which had been united only by the bands of a loose and
voluntary alliance. The troops of the Huns and the Alani would naturally
upbraid the flight of the Goths; who were not disposed to use with
moderation the advantages of their fortune; the ancient jealousy of
the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths could not long be suspended; and the
haughty chiefs still remembered the insults and injuries, which they had
reciprocally offered, or sustained, while the nation was seated in the
countries beyond the Danube. The progress of domestic faction abated
the more diffusive sentiment of national animosity; and the officers of
Theodosius were instructed to purchase, with liberal gifts and promises,
the retreat or service of the discontented party. The acquisition
of Modar, a prince of the royal blood of the Amali, gave a bold and
faithful champion to the cause of Rome. The illustrious deserter
soon obtained the rank of master-general, with an important command;
surprised an army of his countrymen, who were immersed in wine and
sleep; and, after a cruel slaughter of the astonished Goths, returned
with an immense spoil, and four thousand wagons, to the Imperial camp.
<a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> In the hands of a skilful politician, the most different means may
be successfully applied to the same ends; and the peace of the empire,
which had been forwarded by the divisions, was accomplished by the
reunion, of the Gothic nation. Athanaric, who had been a patient
spectator of these extraordinary events, was at length driven, by the
chance of arms, from the dark recesses of the woods of Caucaland. He no
longer hesitated to pass the Danube; and a very considerable part of the
subjects of Fritigern, who already felt the inconveniences of anarchy,
were easily persuaded to acknowledge for their king a Gothic Judge,
whose birth they respected, and whose abilities they had frequently
experienced. But age had chilled the daring spirit of Athanaric; and,
instead of leading his people to the field of battle and victory, he
wisely listened to the fair proposal of an honorable and advantageous
treaty. Theodosius, who was acquainted with the merit and power of his
new ally, condescended to meet him at the distance of several miles
from Constantinople; and entertained him in the Imperial city, with
the confidence of a friend, and the magnificence of a monarch. "The
Barbarian prince observed, with curious attention, the variety of
objects which attracted his notice, and at last broke out into a sincere
and passionate exclamation of wonder. I now behold (said he) what I
never could believe, the glories of this stupendous capital! And as
he cast his eyes around, he viewed, and he admired, the commanding
situation of the city, the strength and beauty of the walls and public
edifices, the capacious harbor, crowded with innumerable vessels, the
perpetual concourse of distant nations, and the arms and discipline of
the troops. Indeed, (continued Athanaric,) the emperor of the Romans is
a god upon earth; and the presumptuous man, who dares to lift his hand
against him, is guilty of his own blood." <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a> The Gothic king did not
long enjoy this splendid and honorable reception; and, as temperance
was not the virtue of his nation, it may justly be suspected, that
his mortal disease was contracted amidst the pleasures of the Imperial
banquets. But the policy of Theodosius derived more solid benefit from
the death, than he could have expected from the most faithful services,
of his ally. The funeral of Athanaric was performed with solemn rites in
the capital of the East; a stately monument was erected to his memory;
and his whole army, won by the liberal courtesy, and decent grief, of
Theodosius, enlisted under the standard of the Roman empire. <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> The
submission of so great a body of the Visigoths was productive of the
most salutary consequences; and the mixed influence of force, of reason,
and of corruption, became every day more powerful, and more extensive.
Each independent chieftain hastened to obtain a separate treaty, from
the apprehension that an obstinate delay might expose him, alone and
unprotected, to the revenge, or justice, of the conqueror. The general,
or rather the final, capitulation of the Goths, may be dated four years,
one month, and twenty-five days, after the defeat and death of the
emperor Valens. <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a>

The provinces of the Danube had been already relieved from the
oppressive weight of the Gruthungi, or Ostrogoths, by the voluntary
retreat of Alatheus and Saphrax, whose restless spirit had prompted them
to seek new scenes of rapine and glory. Their destructive course was
pointed towards the West; but we must be satisfied with a very obscure
and imperfect knowledge of their various adventures. The Ostrogoths
impelled several of the German tribes on the provinces of Gaul;
concluded, and soon violated, a treaty with the emperor Gratian;
advanced into the unknown countries of the North; and, after an interval
of more than four years, returned, with accumulated force, to the banks
of the Lower Danube. Their troops were recruited with the fiercest
warriors of Germany and Scythia; and the soldiers, or at least
the historians, of the empire, no longer recognized the name and
countenances of their former enemies. <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a> The general who commanded
the military and naval powers of the Thracian frontier, soon perceived
that his superiority would be disadvantageous to the public service;
and that the Barbarians, awed by the presence of his fleet and legions,
would probably defer the passage of the river till the approaching
winter. The dexterity of the spies, whom he sent into the Gothic camp,
allured the Barbarians into a fatal snare. They were persuaded that, by
a bold attempt, they might surprise, in the silence and darkness of
the night, the sleeping army of the Romans; and the whole multitude was
hastily embarked in a fleet of three thousand canoes. <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a> The bravest
of the Ostrogoths led the van; the main body consisted of the remainder
of their subjects and soldiers; and the women and children securely
followed in the rear. One of the nights without a moon had been selected
for the execution of their design; and they had almost reached the
southern bank of the Danube, in the firm confidence that they should
find an easy landing and an unguarded camp. But the progress of the
Barbarians was suddenly stopped by an unexpected obstacle a triple line
of vessels, strongly connected with each other, and which formed an
impenetrable chain of two miles and a half along the river. While they
struggled to force their way in the unequal conflict, their right flank
was overwhelmed by the irresistible attack of a fleet of galleys, which
were urged down the stream by the united impulse of oars and of the
tide. The weight and velocity of those ships of war broke, and sunk, and
dispersed, the rude and feeble canoes of the Barbarians; their valor
was ineffectual; and Alatheus, the king, or general, of the Ostrogoths,
perished with his bravest troops, either by the sword of the Romans, or
in the waves of the Danube. The last division of this unfortunate fleet
might regain the opposite shore; but the distress and disorder of the
multitude rendered them alike incapable, either of action or counsel;
and they soon implored the clemency of the victorious enemy. On this
occasion, as well as on many others, it is a difficult task to reconcile
the passions and prejudices of the writers of the age of Theodosius. The
partial and malignant historian, who misrepresents every action of his
reign, affirms, that the emperor did not appear in the field of battle
till the Barbarians had been vanquished by the valor and conduct of his
lieutenant Promotus. <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> The flattering poet, who celebrated, in the
court of Honorius, the glory of the father and of the son, ascribes the
victory to the personal prowess of Theodosius; and almost insinuates,
that the king of the Ostrogoths was slain by the hand of the emperor.
<a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a> The truth of history might perhaps be found in a just medium
between these extreme and contradictory assertions.

<p>
The original treaty which fixed the settlement of the Goths, ascertained
their privileges, and stipulated their obligations, would illustrate the
history of Theodosius and his successors. The series of their history
has imperfectly preserved the spirit and substance of this single
agreement. <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> The ravages of war and tyranny had provided many large
tracts of fertile but uncultivated land for the use of those Barbarians
who might not disdain the practice of agriculture. A numerous colony of
the Visigoths was seated in Thrace; the remains of the Ostrogoths were
planted in Phrygia and Lydia; their immediate wants were supplied by
a distribution of corn and cattle; and their future industry was
encouraged by an exemption from tribute, during a certain term of years.
The Barbarians would have deserved to feel the cruel and perfidious
policy of the Imperial court, if they had suffered themselves to be
dispersed through the provinces. They required, and they obtained,
the sole possession of the villages and districts assigned for their
residence; they still cherished and propagated their native manners
and language; asserted, in the bosom of despotism, the freedom of their
domestic government; and acknowledged the sovereignty of the emperor,
without submitting to the inferior jurisdiction of the laws and
magistrates of Rome. The hereditary chiefs of the tribes and families
were still permitted to command their followers in peace and war; but
the royal dignity was abolished; and the generals of the Goths were
appointed and removed at the pleasure of the emperor. An army of forty
thousand Goths was maintained for the perpetual service of the empire of
the East; and those haughty troops, who assumed the title of Foederati,
or allies, were distinguished by their gold collars, liberal pay, and
licentious privileges. Their native courage was improved by the use
of arms and the knowledge of discipline; and, while the republic was
guarded, or threatened, by the doubtful sword of the Barbarians, the
last sparks of the military flame were finally extinguished in the minds
of the Romans. <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a> Theodosius had the address to persuade his allies,
that the conditions of peace, which had been extorted from him by
prudence and necessity, were the voluntary expressions of his sincere
friendship for the Gothic nation. <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> A different mode of vindication
or apology was opposed to the complaints of the people; who loudly
censured these shameful and dangerous concessions. <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a> The calamities
of the war were painted in the most lively colors; and the first
symptoms of the return of order, of plenty, and security, were
diligently exaggerated. The advocates of Theodosius could affirm, with
some appearance of truth and reason, that it was impossible to extirpate
so many warlike tribes, who were rendered desperate by the loss of their
native country; and that the exhausted provinces would be revived by a
fresh supply of soldiers and husbandmen. The Barbarians still wore
an angry and hostile aspect; but the experience of past times might
encourage the hope, that they would acquire the habits of industry and
obedience; that their manners would be polished by time, education, and
the influence of Christianity; and that their posterity would insensibly
blend with the great body of the Roman people. <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a>

of Greek rhetoric. Orpheus could only charm the wild beasts of Thrace;

Notwithstanding these specious arguments, and these sanguine
expectations, it was apparent to every discerning eye, that the Goths
would long remain the enemies, and might soon become the conquerors
of the Roman empire. Their rude and insolent behavior expressed their
contempt of the citizens and provincials, whom they insulted with
impunity. <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> To the zeal and valor of the Barbarians Theodosius
was indebted for the success of his arms: but their assistance was
precarious; and they were sometimes seduced, by a treacherous and
inconstant disposition, to abandon his standard, at the moment when
their service was the most essential. During the civil war against
Maximus, a great number of Gothic deserters retired into the morasses
of Macedonia, wasted the adjacent provinces, and obliged the intrepid
monarch to expose his person, and exert his power, to suppress the
rising flame of rebellion. <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a> The public apprehensions were fortified
by the strong suspicion, that these tumults were not the effect of
accidental passion, but the result of deep and premeditated design. It
was generally believed, that the Goths had signed the treaty of
peace with a hostile and insidious spirit; and that their chiefs had
previously bound themselves, by a solemn and secret oath, never to
keep faith with the Romans; to maintain the fairest show of loyalty and
friendship, and to watch the favorable moment of rapine, of conquest,
and of revenge. But as the minds of the Barbarians were not insensible
to the power of gratitude, several of the Gothic leaders sincerely
devoted themselves to the service of the empire, or, at least, of the
emperor; the whole nation was insensibly divided into two opposite
factions, and much sophistry was employed in conversation and dispute,
to compare the obligations of their first, and second, engagements. The
Goths, who considered themselves as the friends of peace, of justice,
and of Rome, were directed by the authority of Fravitta, a valiant and
honorable youth, distinguished above the rest of his countrymen by the
politeness of his manners, the liberality of his sentiments, and the
mild virtues of social life. But the more numerous faction adhered to
the fierce and faithless Priulf, <a href="#note-13411" name="noteref-13411"><small>13411</small></a> who inflamed the passions,
and asserted the independence, of his warlike followers. On one of the
solemn festivals, when the chiefs of both parties were invited to the
Imperial table, they were insensibly heated by wine, till they forgot
the usual restraints of discretion and respect, and betrayed, in the
presence of Theodosius, the fatal secret of their domestic disputes.
The emperor, who had been the reluctant witness of this extraordinary
controversy, dissembled his fears and resentment, and soon dismissed the
tumultuous assembly. Fravitta, alarmed and exasperated by the insolence
of his rival, whose departure from the palace might have been the signal
of a civil war, boldly followed him; and, drawing his sword, laid
Priulf dead at his feet. Their companions flew to arms; and the faithful
champion of Rome would have been oppressed by superior numbers, if he
had not been protected by the seasonable interposition of the Imperial
guards. <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a> Such were the scenes of Barbaric rage, which disgraced the
palace and table of the Roman emperor; and, as the impatient Goths could
only be restrained by the firm and temperate character of Theodosius,
the public safety seemed to depend on the life and abilities of a single
man. <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a>

Montesquieu seems ignorant that the Goths, after the defeat of Valens,
never abandoned the Roman territory. It is now thirty years, says
