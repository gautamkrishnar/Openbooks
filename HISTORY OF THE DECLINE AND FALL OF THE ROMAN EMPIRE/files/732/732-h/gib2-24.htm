<p>
The philosophical fable which Julian composed under the name
of the Caesars, <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> is one of the most agreeable and instructive
productions of ancient wit. <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> During the freedom and equality of the
days of the Saturnalia, Romulus prepared a feast for the deities of
Olympus, who had adopted him as a worthy associate, and for the Roman
princes, who had reigned over his martial people, and the vanquished
nations of the earth. The immortals were placed in just order on their
thrones of state, and the table of the Caesars was spread below the Moon
in the upper region of the air. The tyrants, who would have disgraced
the society of gods and men, were thrown headlong, by the inexorable
Nemesis, into the Tartarean abyss. The rest of the Caesars successively
advanced to their seats; and as they passed, the vices, the defects, the
blemishes of their respective characters, were maliciously noticed
by old Silenus, a laughing moralist, who disguised the wisdom of a
philosopher under the mask of a Bacchanal. <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> As soon as the feast
was ended, the voice of Mercury proclaimed the will of Jupiter, that a
celestial crown should be the reward of superior merit. Julius Caesar,
Augustus, Trajan, and Marcus Antoninus, were selected as the most
illustrious candidates; the effeminate Constantine <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> was not excluded
from this honorable competition, and the great Alexander was invited to
dispute the prize of glory with the Roman heroes. Each of the candidates
was allowed to display the merit of his own exploits; but, in the
judgment of the gods, the modest silence of Marcus pleaded more
powerfully than the elaborate orations of his haughty rivals. When the
judges of this awful contest proceeded to examine the heart, and to
scrutinize the springs of action, the superiority of the Imperial Stoic
appeared still more decisive and conspicuous. <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> Alexander and Caesar,
Augustus, Trajan, and Constantine, acknowledged, with a blush, that
fame, or power, or pleasure had been the important object of their
labors: but the gods themselves beheld, with reverence and love,
a virtuous mortal, who had practised on the throne the lessons of
philosophy; and who, in a state of human imperfection, had aspired to
imitate the moral attributes of the Deity. The value of this agreeable
composition (the Caesars of Julian) is enhanced by the rank of the
author. A prince, who delineates, with freedom, the vices and virtues of
his predecessors, subscribes, in every line, the censure or approbation
of his own conduct.

[ See this fable or satire, p. 306-336 of the Leipsig edition
of Julian's works. The French version of the learned Ezekiel Spanheim
(Paris, 1683) is coarse, languid, and correct; and his notes, proofs,
illustrations, &amp;c., are piled on each other till they form a mass of
557 close-printed quarto pages. The Abbe' de la Bleterie (Vie de Jovien,
tom. i. p. 241-393) has more happily expressed the spirit, as well as
the sense, of the original, which he illustrates with some concise and
curious notes.]

[ Spanheim (in his preface) has most learnedly discussed the
etymology, origin, resemblance, and disagreement of the Greek satyrs,
a dramatic piece, which was acted after the tragedy; and the Latin
satires, (from Satura,) a miscellaneous composition, either in prose or
verse. But the Caesars of Julian are of such an original cast, that the
critic is perplexed to which class he should ascribe them. * Note: See
also Casaubon de Satira, with Rambach's observations.&mdash;M.]

religion. On this occasion, the interpreters are compelled, by a most
sacred interest, to renounce their allegiance, and to desert the cause

[ Julian was secretly inclined to prefer a Greek to a
Roman. But when he seriously compared a hero with a philosopher, he was
sensible that mankind had much greater obligations to Socrates than to
Alexander, (Orat. ad Themistium, p. 264.)]
</p>
<p>
In the cool moments of reflection, Julian preferred the useful and
benevolent virtues of Antoninus; but his ambitious spirit was inflamed
by the glory of Alexander; and he solicited, with equal ardor, the
esteem of the wise, and the applause of the multitude. In the season of
life when the powers of the mind and body enjoy the most active vigor,
the emperor who was instructed by the experience, and animated by the
success, of the German war, resolved to signalize his reign by some more
splendid and memorable achievement. The ambassadors of the East, from
the continent of India, and the Isle of Ceylon, <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> had respectfully
saluted the Roman purple. <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> The nations of the West esteemed and
dreaded the personal virtues of Julian, both in peace and war. He
despised the trophies of a Gothic victory, and was satisfied that the
rapacious Barbarians of the Danube would be restrained from any future
violation of the faith of treaties by the terror of his name, and the
additional fortifications with which he strengthened the Thracian and
Illyrian frontiers. The successor of Cyrus and Artaxerxes was the only
rival whom he deemed worthy of his arms; and he resolved, by the final
conquest of Persia, to chastise the naughty nation which had so long
resisted and insulted the majesty of Rome. <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> As soon as the Persian
monarch was informed that the throne of Constantius was filed by a
prince of a very different character, he condescended to make some
artful, or perhaps sincere, overtures towards a negotiation of peace.
But the pride of Sapor was astonished by the firmness of Julian;
who sternly declared, that he would never consent to hold a peaceful
conference among the flames and ruins of the cities of Mesopotamia; and
who added, with a smile of contempt, that it was needless to treat by
ambassadors, as he himself had determined to visit speedily the court
of Persia. The impatience of the emperor urged the diligence of the
military preparations. The generals were named; and Julian, marching
from Constantinople through the provinces of Asia Minor, arrived at
Antioch about eight months after the death of his predecessor. His
ardent desire to march into the heart of Persia, was checked by the
indispensable duty of regulating the state of the empire; by his zeal to
revive the worship of the gods; and by the advice of his wisest friends;
who represented the necessity of allowing the salutary interval of
winter quarters, to restore the exhausted strength of the legions of
Gaul, and the discipline and spirit of the Eastern troops. Julian was
persuaded to fix, till the ensuing spring, his residence at Antioch,
among a people maliciously disposed to deride the haste, and to censure
the delays, of their sovereign. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a>

This island, to which the names of Taprobana, Serendib, and Ceylon, have
been successively applied, manifests how imperfectly the seas and lands
to the east of Cape Comorin were known to the Romans. 1. Under the reign
of Claudius, a freedman, who farmed the customs of the Red Sea, was
accidentally driven by the winds upon this strange and undiscovered
coast: he conversed six months with the natives; and the king of Ceylon,
who heard, for the first time, of the power and justice of Rome, was
persuaded to send an embassy to the emperor. (Plin. Hist. Nat. vi. 24.)
2. The geographers (and even Ptolemy) have magnified, above fifteen
times, the real size of this new world, which they extended as far as
the equator, and the neighborhood of China. * Note: The name of Diva
gens or Divorum regio, according to the probable conjecture of M.
Letronne, (Trois Mem. Acad. p. 127,) was applied by the ancients to the
whole eastern coast of the Indian Peninsula, from Ceylon to the Canges.
The name may be traced in Devipatnam, Devidan, Devicotta, Divinelly, the
point of Divy.&mdash;&mdash;M. Letronne, p.121, considers the freedman with his
embassy from Ceylon to have been an impostor.&mdash;M.]

meliores aiebat: illis enim sufficere mercators Galatas per quos ubique

masters.]

If Julian had flattered himself, that his personal connection with the
capital of the East would be productive of mutual satisfaction to the
prince and people, he made a very false estimate of his own character,
and of the manners of Antioch. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> The warmth of the climate disposed
the natives to the most intemperate enjoyment of tranquillity and
opulence; and the lively licentiousness of the Greeks was blended
with the hereditary softness of the Syrians. Fashion was the only law,
pleasure the only pursuit, and the splendor of dress and furniture was
the only distinction of the citizens of Antioch. The arts of luxury were
honored; the serious and manly virtues were the subject of ridicule; and
the contempt for female modesty and reverent age announced the universal
corruption of the capital of the East. The love of spectacles was the
taste, or rather passion, of the Syrians; the most skilful artists were
procured from the adjacent cities; <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> a considerable share of the
revenue was devoted to the public amusements; and the magnificence of
the games of the theatre and circus was considered as the happiness and
as the glory of Antioch. The rustic manners of a prince who disdained
such glory, and was insensible of such happiness, soon disgusted the
delicacy of his subjects; and the effeminate Orientals could neither
imitate, nor admire, the severe simplicity which Julian always
maintained, and sometimes affected. The days of festivity, consecrated,
by ancient custom, to the honor of the gods, were the only occasions in
which Julian relaxed his philosophic severity; and those festivals
were the only days in which the Syrians of Antioch could reject the
allurements of pleasure. The majority of the people supported the glory
of the Christian name, which had been first invented by their ancestors:
<a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> they contended themselves with disobeying the moral precepts, but
they were scrupulously attached to the speculative doctrines of their
religion. The church of Antioch was distracted by heresy and schism; but
the Arians and the Athanasians, the followers of Meletius and those of
Paulinus, <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> were actuated by the same pious hatred of their common
adversary.

[ The schism of Antioch, which lasted eighty-five years,
(A. D. 330-415,) was inflamed, while Julian resided in that city, by the
indiscreet ordination of Paulinus. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. iii.
p. 803 of the quarto edition, (Paris, 1701, &amp;c,) which henceforward I
shall quote.]
</p>
<p>
The strongest prejudice was entertained against the character of an
apostate, the enemy and successor of a prince who had engaged the
affections of a very numerous sect; and the removal of St. Babylas
excited an implacable opposition to the person of Julian. His subjects
complained, with superstitious indignation, that famine had pursued the
emperor's steps from Constantinople to Antioch; and the discontent of
a hungry people was exasperated by the injudicious attempt to relieve
their distress. The inclemency of the season had affected the harvests
of Syria; and the price of bread, <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a> in the markets of Antioch, had
naturally risen in proportion to the scarcity of corn. But the fair
and reasonable proportion was soon violated by the rapacious arts of
monopoly. In this unequal contest, in which the produce of the land is
claimed by one party as his exclusive property, is used by another as a
lucrative object of trade, and is required by a third for the daily and
necessary support of life, all the profits of the intermediate agents
are accumulated on the head of the defenceless customers. The hardships
of their situation were exaggerated and increased by their own
impatience and anxiety; and the apprehension of a scarcity gradually
produced the appearances of a famine. When the luxurious citizens
of Antioch complained of the high price of poultry and fish, Julian
publicly declared, that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a
regular supply of wine, oil, and bread; but he acknowledged, that it was
the duty of a sovereign to provide for the subsistence of his people.
With this salutary view, the emperor ventured on a very dangerous and
doubtful step, of fixing, by legal authority, the value of corn. He
enacted, that, in a time of scarcity, it should be sold at a price which
had seldom been known in the most plentiful years; and that his own
example might strengthen his laws, he sent into the market four hundred
and twenty-two thousand modii, or measures, which were drawn by his
order from the granaries of Hierapolis, of Chalcis, and even of Egypt.
The consequences might have been foreseen, and were soon felt. The
Imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants; the proprietors of
land, or of corn, withheld from the city the accustomed supply; and the
small quantities that appeared in the market were secretly sold at an
advanced and illegal price. Julian still continued to applaud his own
policy, treated the complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful
murmur, and convinced Antioch that he had inherited the obstinacy,
though not the cruelty, of his brother Gallus. <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> The remonstrances of
the municipal senate served only to exasperate his inflexible mind.
He was persuaded, perhaps with truth, that the senators of Antioch who
possessed lands, or were concerned in trade, had themselves contributed
to the calamities of their country; and he imputed the disrespectful
boldness which they assumed, to the sense, not of public duty, but of
private interest. The whole body, consisting of two hundred of the most
noble and wealthy citizens, were sent, under a guard, from the palace to
the prison; and though they were permitted, before the close of evening,
to return to their respective houses, <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> the emperor himself could
not obtain the forgiveness which he had so easily granted. The same
grievances were still the subject of the same complaints, which were
industriously circulated by the wit and levity of the Syrian Greeks.
During the licentious days of the Saturnalia, the streets of the city
resounded with insolent songs, which derided the laws, the religion,
the personal conduct, and even the beard, of the emperor; the spirit
of Antioch was manifested by the connivance of the magistrates, and the
applause of the multitude. <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> The disciple of Socrates was too deeply
affected by these popular insults; but the monarch, endowed with a quick
sensibility, and possessed of absolute power, refused his passions
the gratification of revenge. A tyrant might have proscribed, without
distinction, the lives and fortunes of the citizens of Antioch; and
the unwarlike Syrians must have patiently submitted to the lust, the
rapaciousness and the cruelty, of the faithful legions of Gaul. A milder
sentence might have deprived the capital of the East of its honors and
privileges; and the courtiers, perhaps the subjects, of Julian, would
have applauded an act of justice, which asserted the dignity of the
supreme magistrate of the republic. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a> But instead of abusing, or
exerting, the authority of the state, to revenge his personal injuries,
Julian contented himself with an inoffensive mode of retaliation, which
it would be in the power of few princes to employ. He had been insulted
by satires and libels; in his turn, he composed, under the title of
the Enemy of the Beard, an ironical confession of his own faults, and a
severe satire on the licentious and effeminate manners of Antioch. This
Imperial reply was publicly exposed before the gates of the palace; and
the Misopogon <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> still remains a singular monument of the resentment,
the wit, the humanity, and the indiscretion of Julian. Though he
affected to laugh, he could not forgive. <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> His contempt was
expressed, and his revenge might be gratified, by the nomination of a
governor <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> worthy only of such subjects; and the emperor, forever
renouncing the ungrateful city, proclaimed his resolution to pass the
ensuing winter at Tarsus in Cilicia. <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a>

[ Julian states three different proportions, of five,
ten, or fifteen medii of wheat for one piece of gold, according to the
degrees of plenty and scarcity, (in Misopogon, p. 369.) From this fact,
and from some collateral examples, I conclude, that under the successors
of Constantine, the moderate price of wheat was about thirty-two
shillings the English quarter, which is equal to the average price
of the sixty-four first years of the present century. See Arbuthnot's

<p>
Yet Antioch possessed one citizen, whose genius and virtues might atone,
in the opinion of Julian, for the vice and folly of his country. The
sophist Libanius was born in the capital of the East; he publicly
professed the arts of rhetoric and declamation at Nice, Nicomedia,
Constantinople, Athens, and, during the remainder of his life, at
Antioch. His school was assiduously frequented by the Grecian youth; his
disciples, who sometimes exceeded the number of eighty, celebrated their
incomparable master; and the jealousy of his rivals, who persecuted him
from one city to another, confirmed the favorable opinion which Libanius
ostentatiously displayed of his superior merit. The preceptors of Julian
had extorted a rash but solemn assurance, that he would never attend
the lectures of their adversary: the curiosity of the royal youth
was checked and inflamed: he secretly procured the writings of this
dangerous sophist, and gradually surpassed, in the perfect imitation of
his style, the most laborious of his domestic pupils. <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> When Julian
ascended the throne, he declared his impatience to embrace and reward
the Syrian sophist, who had preserved, in a degenerate age, the
Grecian purity of taste, of manners, and of religion. The emperor's
prepossession was increased and justified by the discreet pride of his
favorite. Instead of pressing, with the foremost of the crowd, into
the palace of Constantinople, Libanius calmly expected his arrival
at Antioch; withdrew from court on the first symptoms of coldness and
indifference; required a formal invitation for each visit; and taught
his sovereign an important lesson, that he might command the obedience
of a subject, but that he must deserve the attachment of a friend.
The sophists of every age, despising, or affecting to despise, the
accidental distinctions of birth and fortune, <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> reserve their esteem
for the superior qualities of the mind, with which they themselves are
so plentifully endowed. Julian might disdain the acclamations of a venal
court, who adored the Imperial purple; but he was deeply flattered by
the praise, the admonition, the freedom, and the envy of an independent
philosopher, who refused his favors, loved his person, celebrated his
fame, and protected his memory. The voluminous writings of Libanius
still exist; for the most part, they are the vain and idle compositions
of an orator, who cultivated the science of words; the productions of
a recluse student, whose mind, regardless of his contemporaries, was
incessantly fixed on the Trojan war and the Athenian commonwealth.
Yet the sophist of Antioch sometimes descended from this imaginary
elevation; he entertained a various and elaborate correspondence; <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a>
he praised the virtues of his own times; he boldly arraigned the abuse
of public and private life; and he eloquently pleaded the cause of
Antioch against the just resentment of Julian and Theodosius. It is the
common calamity of old age, <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a> to lose whatever might have rendered it
desirable; but Libanius experienced the peculiar misfortune of surviving
the religion and the sciences, to which he had consecrated his genius.
The friend of Julian was an indignant spectator of the triumph of
Christianity; and his bigotry, which darkened the prospect of the
visible world, did not inspire Libanius with any lively hopes of
celestial glory and happiness. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
The martial impatience of Julian urged him to take the field in the
beginning of the spring; and he dismissed, with contempt and reproach,
the senate of Antioch, who accompanied the emperor beyond the limits of
their own territory, to which he was resolved never to return. After a
laborious march of two days, <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> he halted on the third at Beraea,
or Aleppo, where he had the mortification of finding a senate almost
entirely Christian; who received with cold and formal demonstrations of
respect the eloquent sermon of the apostle of paganism. The son of one
of the most illustrious citizens of Beraea, who had embraced,
either from interest or conscience, the religion of the emperor, was
disinherited by his angry parent. The father and the son were invited
to the Imperial table. Julian, placing himself between them, attempted,
without success, to inculcate the lesson and example of toleration;
supported, with affected calmness, the indiscreet zeal of the aged
Christian, who seemed to forget the sentiments of nature, and the duty
of a subject; and at length, turning towards the afflicted youth, "Since
you have lost a father," said he, "for my sake, it is incumbent on me to
supply his place." <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> The emperor was received in a manner much more
agreeable to his wishes at Batnae, <a href="#note-3011" name="noteref-3011"><small>3011</small></a> a small town pleasantly seated
in a grove of cypresses, about twenty miles from the city of Hierapolis.
The solemn rites of sacrifice were decently prepared by the inhabitants
of Batnae, who seemed attached to the worship of their tutelar deities,
Apollo and Jupiter; but the serious piety of Julian was offended by the
tumult of their applause; and he too clearly discerned, that the smoke
which arose from their altars was the incense of flattery, rather than
of devotion. The ancient and magnificent temple which had sanctified,
for so many ages, the city of Hierapolis, <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> no longer subsisted; and
the consecrated wealth, which afforded a liberal maintenance to more
than three hundred priests, might hasten its downfall. Yet Julian
enjoyed the satisfaction of embracing a philosopher and a friend, whose
religious firmness had withstood the pressing and repeated solicitations
of Constantius and Gallus, as often as those princes lodged at his
house, in their passage through Hierapolis. In the hurry of military
preparation, and the careless confidence of a familiar correspondence,
the zeal of Julian appears to have been lively and uniform. He had now
undertaken an important and difficult war; and the anxiety of the event
rendered him still more attentive to observe and register the most
trifling presages, from which, according to the rules of divination, any
knowledge of futurity could be derived. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> He informed Libanius of
his progress as far as Hierapolis, by an elegant epistle, <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> which
displays the facility of his genius, and his tender friendship for the
sophist of Antioch.

Hierapolis, <a href="#note-3311" name="noteref-3311"><small>3311</small></a> situate almost on the banks of the Euphrates, <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a>
had been appointed for the general rendezvous of the Roman troops,
who immediately passed the great river on a bridge of boats, which was
previously constructed. <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> If the inclinations of Julian had been
similar to those of his predecessor, he might have wasted the active
and important season of the year in the circus of Samosata or in the
churches of Edessa. But as the warlike emperor, instead of Constantius,
had chosen Alexander for his model, he advanced without delay to
Carrhae, <a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> a very ancient city of Mesopotamia, at the distance of
fourscore miles from Hierapolis. The temple of the Moon attracted the
devotion of Julian; but the halt of a few days was principally employed
in completing the immense preparations of the Persian war. The secret of
the expedition had hitherto remained in his own breast; but as Carrhae
is the point of separation of the two great roads, he could no longer
conceal whether it was his design to attack the dominions of Sapor
on the side of the Tigris, or on that of the Euphrates. The emperor
detached an army of thirty thousand men, under the command of his
kinsman Procopius, and of Sebastian, who had been duke of Egypt. They
were ordered to direct their march towards Nisibis, and to secure
the frontier from the desultory incursions of the enemy, before they
attempted the passage of the Tigris. Their subsequent operations were
left to the discretion of the generals; but Julian expected, that after
wasting with fire and sword the fertile districts of Media and Adiabene,
they might arrive under the walls of Ctesiphon at the same time that he
himself, advancing with equal steps along the banks of the Euphrates,
should besiege the capital of the Persian monarchy. The success of this
well-concerted plan depended, in a great measure, on the powerful and
ready assistance of the king of Armenia, who, without exposing the
safety of his own dominions, might detach an army of four thousand
horse, and twenty thousand foot, to the assistance of the Romans. <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a>
But the feeble Arsaces Tiranus, <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> king of Armenia, had degenerated
still more shamefully than his father Chosroes, from the manly virtues
of the great Tiridates; and as the pusillanimous monarch was averse
to any enterprise of danger and glory, he could disguise his timid
indolence by the more decent excuses of religion and gratitude. He
expressed a pious attachment to the memory of Constantius, from whose
hands he had received in marriage Olympias, the daughter of the praefect
Ablavius; and the alliance of a female, who had been educated as
the destined wife of the emperor Constans, exalted the dignity of
a Barbarian king. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> Tiranus professed the Christian religion; he
reigned over a nation of Christians; and he was restrained, by every
principle of conscience and interest, from contributing to the victory,
which would consummate the ruin of the church. The alienated mind of
Tiranus was exasperated by the indiscretion of Julian, who treated the
king of Armenia as his slave, and as the enemy of the gods. The haughty
and threatening style of the Imperial mandates <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> awakened the secret
indignation of a prince, who, in the humiliating state of dependence,
was still conscious of his royal descent from the Arsacides, the lords
of the East, and the rivals of the Roman power. <a href="#note-4011" name="noteref-4011"><small>4011</small></a>

&mdash;&mdash;Arsaces Tiranus, or Diran, had ceased to reign twenty-five years
before, in 337. The intermediate changes in Armenia, and the character
of this Arsaces, the son of Diran, are traced by M. St. Martin, at
considerable length, in his supplement to Le Beau, ii. 208-242. As long
as his Grecian queen Olympias maintained her influence, Arsaces was
faithful to the Roman and Christian alliance. On the accession of
Julian, the same influence made his fidelity to waver; but Olympias
having been poisoned in the sacramental bread by the agency of
Pharandcem, the former wife of Arsaces, another change took place in
Armenian politics unfavorable to the Christian interest. The patriarch
Narses retired from the impious court to a safe seclusion. Yet
Pharandsem was equally hostile to the Persian influence, and Arsaces
began to support with vigor the cause of Julian. He made an inroad into
the Persian dominions with a body of Rans and Alans as auxiliaries;
wasted Aderbidgan and Sapor, who had been defeated near Tauriz, was
engaged in making head against his troops in Persarmenia, at the time of
the death of Julian. Such is M. St. Martin's view, (ii. 276, et sqq.,)
which rests on the Armenian historians, Faustos of Byzantium, and Mezrob
the biographer of the Partriarch Narses. In the history of Armenia
by Father Chamitch, and translated by Avdall, Tiran is still king of
Armenia, at the time of Julian's death. F. Chamitch follows Moses of

The military dispositions of Julian were skilfully contrived to deceive
the spies and to divert the attention of Sapor. The legions appeared
to direct their march towards Nisibis and the Tigris. On a sudden they
wheeled to the right; traversed the level and naked plain of Carrhae;
and reached, on the third day, the banks of the Euphrates, where the
strong town of Nicephorium, or Callinicum, had been founded by the
Macedonian kings. From thence the emperor pursued his march, above
ninety miles, along the winding stream of the Euphrates, till, at
length, about one month after his departure from Antioch, he discovered
the towers of Circesium, <a href="#note-4012" name="noteref-4012"><small>4012</small></a> the extreme limit of the Roman dominions.
The army of Julian, the most numerous that any of the Caesars had ever
led against Persia, consisted of sixty-five thousand effective and
well-disciplined soldiers. The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry, of
Romans and Barbarians, had been selected from the different provinces;
and a just preeminence of loyalty and valor was claimed by the hardy
Gauls, who guarded the throne and person of their beloved prince.
A formidable body of Scythian auxiliaries had been transported from
another climate, and almost from another world, to invade a distant
country, of whose name and situation they were ignorant. The love
of rapine and war allured to the Imperial standard several tribes of
Saracens, or roving Arabs, whose service Julian had commanded, while
he sternly refuse the payment of the accustomed subsidies. The broad
channel of the Euphrates <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> was crowded by a fleet of eleven hundred
ships, destined to attend the motions, and to satisfy the wants, of the
Roman army. The military strength of the fleet was composed of fifty
armed galleys; and these were accompanied by an equal number of
flat-bottomed boats, which might occasionally be connected into the
form of temporary bridges. The rest of the ships, partly constructed
of timber, and partly covered with raw hides, were laden with an almost
inexhaustible supply of arms and engines, of utensils and provisions.
The vigilant humanity of Julian had embarked a very large magazine of
vinegar and biscuit for the use of the soldiers, but he prohibited the
indulgence of wine; and rigorously stopped a long string of superfluous
camels that attempted to follow the rear of the army. The River Chaboras
falls into the Euphrates at Circesium; <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> and as soon as the trumpet
gave the signal of march, the Romans passed the little stream which
separated two mighty and hostile empires. The custom of ancient
discipline required a military oration; and Julian embraced every
opportunity of displaying his eloquence. He animated the impatient and
attentive legions by the example of the inflexible courage and glorious
triumphs of their ancestors. He excited their resentment by a lively
picture of the insolence of the Persians; and he exhorted them to
imitate his firm resolution, either to extirpate that perfidious nation,
or to devote his life in the cause of the republic. The eloquence of
Julian was enforced by a donative of one hundred and thirty pieces of
silver to every soldier; and the bridge of the Chaboras was instantly
cut away, to convince the troops that they must place their hopes of
safety in the success of their arms. Yet the prudence of the emperor
induced him to secure a remote frontier, perpetually exposed to the
inroads of the hostile Arabs. A detachment of four thousand men was
left at Circesium, which completed, to the number of ten thousand, the
regular garrison of that important fortress. <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a>

From the moment that the Romans entered the enemy's country, <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> the
country of an active and artful enemy, the order of march was disposed
in three columns. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> The strength of the infantry, and consequently of
the whole army was placed in the centre, under the peculiar command
of their master-general Victor. On the right, the brave Nevitta led a
column of several legions along the banks of the Euphrates, and almost
always in sight of the fleet. The left flank of the army was protected
by the column of cavalry. Hormisdas and Arinthaeus were appointed
generals of the horse; and the singular adventures of Hormisdas <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a>
are not undeserving of our notice. He was a Persian prince, of the royal
race of the Sassanides, who, in the troubles of the minority of
Sapor, had escaped from prison to the hospitable court of the great
Constantine. Hormisdas at first excited the compassion, and at length
acquired the esteem, of his new masters; his valor and fidelity raised
him to the military honors of the Roman service; and though a Christian,
he might indulge the secret satisfaction of convincing his ungrateful
country, than at oppressed subject may prove the most dangerous enemy.
Such was the disposition of the three principal columns. The front and
flanks of the army were covered by Lucilianus with a flying detachment
of fifteen hundred light-armed soldiers, whose active vigilance observed
the most distant signs, and conveyed the earliest notice, of any hostile
approach. Dagalaiphus, and Secundinus duke of Osrhoene, conducted
the troops of the rear-guard; the baggage securely proceeded in the
intervals of the columns; and the ranks, from a motive either of use
or ostentation, were formed in such open order, that the whole line of
march extended almost ten miles. The ordinary post of Julian was at the
head of the centre column; but as he preferred the duties of a general
to the state of a monarch, he rapidly moved, with a small escort of
light cavalry, to the front, the rear, the flanks, wherever his presence
could animate or protect the march of the Roman army. The country which
they traversed from the Chaboras, to the cultivated lands of Assyria,
may be considered as a part of the desert of Arabia, a dry and barren
waste, which could never be improved by the most powerful arts of human
industry. Julian marched over the same ground which had been trod above
seven hundred years before by the footsteps of the younger Cyrus, and
which is described by one of the companions of his expedition, the sage
and heroic Xenophon. <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> "The country was a plain throughout, as even
as the sea, and full of wormwood; and if any other kind of shrubs or
reeds grew there, they had all an aromatic smell, but no trees could be
seen. Bustards and ostriches, antelopes and wild asses, <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> appeared
to be the only inhabitants of the desert; and the fatigues of the march
were alleviated by the amusements of the chase." The loose sand of the
desert was frequently raised by the wind into clouds of dust; and a
great number of the soldiers of Julian, with their tents, were suddenly
thrown to the ground by the violence of an unexpected hurricane.

The sandy plains of Mesopotamia were abandoned to the antelopes and wild
asses of the desert; but a variety of populous towns and villages were
pleasantly situated on the banks of the Euphrates, and in the islands
which are occasionally formed by that river. The city of Annah, or
Anatho, <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> the actual residence of an Arabian emir, is composed of
two long streets, which enclose, within a natural fortification, a
small island in the midst, and two fruitful spots on either side, of
the Euphrates. The warlike inhabitants of Anatho showed a disposition
to stop the march of a Roman emperor; till they were diverted from such
fatal presumption by the mild exhortations of Prince Hormisdas, and
the approaching terrors of the fleet and army. They implored, and
experienced, the clemency of Julian, who transplanted the people to an
advantageous settlement, near Chalcis in Syria, and admitted Pusaeus,
the governor, to an honorable rank in his service and friendship. But
the impregnable fortress of Thilutha could scorn the menace of a
siege; and the emperor was obliged to content himself with an insulting
promise, that, when he had subdued the interior provinces of Persia,
Thilutha would no longer refuse to grace the triumph of the emperor. The
inhabitants of the open towns, unable to resist, and unwilling to
yield, fled with precipitation; and their houses, filled with spoil
and provisions, were occupied by the soldiers of Julian, who massacred,
without remorse and without punishment, some defenceless women. During
the march, the Surenas, <a href="#note-4911" name="noteref-4911"><small>4911</small></a> or Persian general, and Malek Rodosaces,
the renowned emir of the tribe of Gassan, <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a> incessantly hovered
round the army; every straggler was intercepted; every detachment was
attacked; and the valiant Hormisdas escaped with some difficulty from
their hands. But the Barbarians were finally repulsed; the country
became every day less favorable to the operations of cavalry; and when
the Romans arrived at Macepracta, they perceived the ruins of the wall,
which had been constructed by the ancient kings of Assyria, to secure
their dominions from the incursions of the Medes. These preliminaries of
the expedition of Julian appear to have employed about fifteen days; and
we may compute near three hundred miles from the fortress of Circesium
to the wall of Macepracta. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a>

The fertile province of Assyria, <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a> which stretched beyond the Tigris,
as far as the mountains of Media, <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> extended about four hundred miles
from the ancient wall of Macepracta, to the territory of Basra, where
the united streams of the Euphrates and Tigris discharge themselves into
the Persian Gulf. <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> The whole country might have claimed the peculiar
name of Mesopotamia; as the two rivers, which are never more distant
than fifty, approach, between Bagdad and Babylon, within twenty-five
miles, of each other. A multitude of artificial canals, dug without much
labor in a soft and yielding soil connected the rivers, and intersected
the plain of Assyria. The uses of these artificial canals were various
and important. They served to discharge the superfluous waters from one
river into the other, at the season of their respective inundations.
Subdividing themselves into smaller and smaller branches, they refreshed
the dry lands, and supplied the deficiency of rain. They facilitated the
intercourse of peace and commerce; and, as the dams could be speedily
broke down, they armed the despair of the Assyrians with the means of
opposing a sudden deluge to the progress of an invading army. To the
soil and climate of Assyria, nature had denied some of her choicest
gifts, the vine, the olive, and the fig-tree; <a href="#note-5411" name="noteref-5411"><small>5411</small></a> but the food which
supports the life of man, and particularly wheat and barley, were
produced with inexhaustible fertility; and the husbandman, who committed
his seed to the earth, was frequently rewarded with an increase of two,
or even of three, hundred. The face of the country was interspersed
with groves of innumerable palm-trees; <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a> and the diligent natives
celebrated, either in verse or prose, the three hundred and sixty uses
to which the trunk, the branches, the leaves, the juice, and the fruit,
were skilfully applied. Several manufactures, especially those of
leather and linen, employed the industry of a numerous people, and
afforded valuable materials for foreign trade; which appears, however,
to have been conducted by the hands of strangers. Babylon had been
converted into a royal park; but near the ruins of the ancient capital,
new cities had successively arisen, and the populousness of the country
was displayed in the multitude of towns and villages, which were built
of bricks dried in the sun, and strongly cemented with bitumen; the
natural and peculiar production of the Babylonian soil. While the
successors of Cyrus reigned over Asia, the province of Syria alone
maintained, during a third part of the year, the luxurious plenty of the
table and household of the Great King. Four considerable villages
were assigned for the subsistence of his Indian dogs; eight hundred
stallions, and sixteen thousand mares, were constantly kept, at the
expense of the country, for the royal stables; and as the daily tribute,
which was paid to the satrap, amounted to one English bushe of silver,
we may compute the annual revenue of Assyria at more than twelve hundred
thousand pounds sterling. <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.&mdash;Part III.
</h2>
<p>
The fields of Assyria were devoted by Julian to the calamities of war;
and the philosopher retaliated on a guiltless people the acts of rapine
and cruelty which had been committed by their haughty master in the
Roman provinces. The trembling Assyrians summoned the rivers to their
assistance; and completed, with their own hands, the ruin of their
country. The roads were rendered impracticable; a flood of waters was
poured into the camp; and, during several days, the troops of Julian
were obliged to contend with the most discouraging hardships. But every
obstacle was surmounted by the perseverance of the legionaries, who were
inured to toil as well as to danger, and who felt themselves animated
by the spirit of their leader. The damage was gradually repaired;
the waters were restored to their proper channels; whole groves of
palm-trees were cut down, and placed along the broken parts of the road;
and the army passed over the broad and deeper canals, on bridges of
floating rafts, which were supported by the help of bladders. Two cities
of Assyria presumed to resist the arms of a Roman emperor: and they
both paid the severe penalty of their rashness. At the distance of fifty
miles from the royal residence of Ctesiphon, Perisabor, <a href="#note-5711" name="noteref-5711"><small>5711</small></a> or Anbar,
held the second rank in the province; a city, large, populous, and well
fortified, surrounded with a double wall, almost encompassed by a branch
of the Euphrates, and defended by the valor of a numerous garrison. The
exhortations of Hormisdas were repulsed with contempt; and the ears of
the Persian prince were wounded by a just reproach, that, unmindful of
his royal birth, he conducted an army of strangers against his king and
country. The Assyrians maintained their loyalty by a skilful, as well
as vigorous, defence; till the lucky stroke of a battering-ram, having
opened a large breach, by shattering one of the angles of the wall, they
hastily retired into the fortifications of the interior citadel. The
soldiers of Julian rushed impetuously into the town, and after the
full gratification of every military appetite, Perisabor was reduced to
ashes; and the engines which assaulted the citadel were planted on the
ruins of the smoking houses. The contest was continued by an incessant
and mutual discharge of missile weapons; and the superiority which the
Romans might derive from the mechanical powers of their balistae and
catapultae was counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground on the
side of the besieged. But as soon as an Helepolis had been constructed,
which could engage on equal terms with the loftiest ramparts, the
tremendous aspect of a moving turret, that would leave no hope of
resistance or mercy, terrified the defenders of the citadel into an
humble submission; and the place was surrendered only two days after
Julian first appeared under the walls of Perisabor. Two thousand five
hundred persons, of both sexes, the feeble remnant of a flourishing
people, were permitted to retire; the plentiful magazines of corn,
of arms, and of splendid furniture, were partly distributed among the
troops, and partly reserved for the public service; the useless stores
were destroyed by fire or thrown into the stream of the Euphrates; and
the fate of Amida was revenged by the total ruin of Perisabor.

Schahbour; in Persian, the victory of Schahpour. It owed that name to
Sapor the First. It was before called Anbar St. Martin, iii. 85.&mdash;M.]
</p>
<p>
The city or rather fortress, of Maogamalcha, which was defended by
sixteen large towers, a deep ditch, and two strong and solid walls of
brick and bitumen, appears to have been constructed at the distance of
eleven miles, as the safeguard of the capital of Persia. The emperor,
apprehensive of leaving such an important fortress in his rear,
immediately formed the siege of Maogamalcha; and the Roman army was
distributed, for that purpose, into three divisions. Victor, at the head
of the cavalry, and of a detachment of heavy-armed foot, was ordered to
clear the country, as far as the banks of the Tigris, and the suburbs of
Ctesiphon. The conduct of the attack was assumed by Julian himself, who
seemed to place his whole dependence in the military engines which
he erected against the walls; while he secretly contrived a more
efficacious method of introducing his troops into the heart of the city
Under the direction of Nevitta and Dagalaiphus, the trenches were opened
at a considerable distance, and gradually prolonged as far as the edge
of the ditch. The ditch was speedily filled with earth; and, by the
incessant labor of the troops, a mine was carried under the foundations
of the walls, and sustained, at sufficient intervals, by props of
timber. Three chosen cohorts, advancing in a single file, silently
explored the dark and dangerous passage; till their intrepid leader
whispered back the intelligence, that he was ready to issue from his
confinement into the streets of the hostile city. Julian checked their
ardor, that he might insure their success; and immediately diverted
the attention of the garrison, by the tumult and clamor of a general
assault. The Persians, who, from their walls, contemptuously beheld the
progress of an impotent attack, celebrated with songs of triumph the
glory of Sapor; and ventured to assure the emperor, that he might
ascend the starry mansion of Ormusd, before he could hope to take the
impregnable city of Maogamalcha. The city was already taken. History has
recorded the name of a private soldier the first who ascended from the
mine into a deserted tower. The passage was widened by his companions,
who pressed forwards with impatient valor. Fifteen hundred enemies were
already in the midst of the city. The astonished garrison abandoned the
walls, and their only hope of safety; the gates were instantly burst
open; and the revenge of the soldier, unless it were suspended by lust
or avarice, was satiated by an undistinguishing massacre. The governor,
who had yielded on a promise of mercy, was burnt alive, a few days
afterwards, on a charge of having uttered some disrespectful words
against the honor of Prince Hormisdas. The fortifications were razed to
the ground; and not a vestige was left, that the city of Maogamalcha had
ever existed. The neighborhood of the capital of Persia was adorned with
three stately palaces, laboriously enriched with every production that
could gratify the luxury and pride of an Eastern monarch. The pleasant
situation of the gardens along the banks of the Tigris, was improved,
according to the Persian taste, by the symmetry of flowers, fountains,
and shady walks: and spacious parks were enclosed for the reception
of the bears, lions, and wild boars, which were maintained at a
considerable expense for the pleasure of the royal chase. The park walls
were broken down, the savage game was abandoned to the darts of the
soldiers, and the palaces of Sapor were reduced to ashes, by the command
of the Roman emperor. Julian, on this occasion, showed himself ignorant,
or careless, of the laws of civility, which the prudence and refinement
of polished ages have established between hostile princes. Yet these
wanton ravages need not excite in our breasts any vehement emotions of
pity or resentment. A simple, naked statue, finished by the hand of a
Grecian artist, is of more genuine value than all these rude and costly
monuments of Barbaric labor; and, if we are more deeply affected by the
ruin of a palace than by the conflagration of a cottage, our humanity
must have formed a very erroneous estimate of the miseries of human
life. <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a>

Julian was an object of hatred and terror to the Persian and the
painters of that nation represented the invader of their country under
the emblem of a furious lion, who vomited from his mouth a consuming
fire. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> To his friends and soldiers the philosophic hero appeared
in a more amiable light; and his virtues were never more conspicuously
displayed, than in the last and most active period of his life. He
practised, without effort, and almost without merit, the habitual
qualities of temperance and sobriety. According to the dictates of that
artificial wisdom, which assumes an absolute dominion over the mind
and body, he sternly refused himself the indulgence of the most natural
appetites. <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> In the warm climate of Assyria, which solicited a
luxurious people to the gratification of every sensual desire, <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> a
youthful conqueror preserved his chastity pure and inviolate; nor was
Julian ever tempted, even by a motive of curiosity, to visit his female
captives of exquisite beauty, <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> who, instead of resisting his power,
would have disputed with each other the honor of his embraces. With the
same firmness that he resisted the allurements of love, he sustained the
hardships of war. When the Romans marched through the flat and flooded
country, their sovereign, on foot, at the head of his legions, shared
their fatigues and animated their diligence. In every useful labor, the
hand of Julian was prompt and strenuous; and the Imperial purple was wet
and dirty as the coarse garment of the meanest soldier. The two sieges
allowed him some remarkable opportunities of signalizing his personal
valor, which, in the improved state of the military art, can seldom
be exerted by a prudent general. The emperor stood before the citadel
before the citadel of Perisabor, insensible of his extreme danger,
and encouraged his troops to burst open the gates of iron, till he was
almost overwhelmed under a cloud of missile weapons and huge stones,
that were directed against his person. As he examined the exterior
fortifications of Maogamalcha, two Persians, devoting themselves for
their country, suddenly rushed upon him with drawn cimeters: the emperor
dexterously received their blows on his uplifted shield; and, with a
steady and well-aimed thrust, laid one of his adversaries dead at
his feet. The esteem of a prince who possesses the virtues which he
approves, is the noblest recompense of a deserving subject; and the
authority which Julian derived from his personal merit, enabled him to
revive and enforce the rigor of ancient discipline. He punished with
death or ignominy the misbehavior of three troops of horse, who, in
a skirmish with the Surenas, had lost their honor and one of their
standards: and he distinguished with obsidional <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> crowns the valor of
the foremost soldiers, who had ascended into the city of Maogamalcha.
</p>
<p>
After the siege of Perisabor, the firmness of the emperor was exercised
by the insolent avarice of the army, who loudly complained, that their
services were rewarded by a trifling donative of one hundred pieces
of silver. His just indignation was expressed in the grave and manly
language of a Roman. "Riches are the object of your desires; those
riches are in the hands of the Persians; and the spoils of this fruitful
country are proposed as the prize of your valor and discipline. Believe
me," added Julian, "the Roman republic, which formerly possessed such
immense treasures, is now reduced to want and wretchedness once our
princes have been persuaded, by weak and interested ministers, to
purchase with gold the tranquillity of the Barbarians. The revenue is
exhausted; the cities are ruined; the provinces are dispeopled.
For myself, the only inheritance that I have received from my royal
ancestors is a soul incapable of fear; and as long as I am convinced
that every real advantage is seated in the mind, I shall not blush to
acknowledge an honorable poverty, which, in the days of ancient virtue,
was considered as the glory of Fabricius. That glory, and that virtue,
may be your own, if you will listen to the voice of Heaven and of your
leader. But if you will rashly persist, if you are determined to renew
the shameful and mischievous examples of old seditions, proceed. As
it becomes an emperor who has filled the first rank among men, I am
prepared to die, standing; and to despise a precarious life, which,
every hour, may depend on an accidental fever. If I have been found
unworthy of the command, there are now among you, (I speak it with pride
and pleasure,) there are many chiefs whose merit and experience are
equal to the conduct of the most important war. Such has been the
temper of my reign, that I can retire, without regret, and without
apprehension, to the obscurity of a private station" <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> The modest
resolution of Julian was answered by the unanimous applause and cheerful
obedience of the Romans, who declared their confidence of victory, while
they fought under the banners of their heroic prince. Their courage was
kindled by his frequent and familiar asseverations, (for such wishes
were the oaths of Julian,) "So may I reduce the Persians under the
yoke!" "Thus may I restore the strength and splendor of the republic!"
The love of fame was the ardent passion of his soul: but it was not
before he trampled on the ruins of Maogamalcha, that he allowed
himself to say, "We have now provided some materials for the sophist of
Antioch." <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a>

The successful valor of Julian had triumphed over all the obstacles that
opposed his march to the gates of Ctesiphon. But the reduction, or even
the siege, of the capital of Persia, was still at a distance: nor can
the military conduct of the emperor be clearly apprehended, without a
knowledge of the country which was the theatre of his bold and skilful
operations. <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> Twenty miles to the south of Bagdad, and on the eastern
bank of the Tigris, the curiosity of travellers has observed some ruins
of the palaces of Ctesiphon, which, in the time of Julian, was a great
and populous city. The name and glory of the adjacent Seleucia were
forever extinguished; and the only remaining quarter of that Greek
colony had resumed, with the Assyrian language and manners, the
primitive appellation of Coche. Coche was situate on the western side
of the Tigris; but it was naturally considered as a suburb of Ctesiphon,
with which we may suppose it to have been connected by a permanent
bridge of boats.
</p>
<p>
The united parts contribute to form the common epithet of Al Modain, the
cities, which the Orientals have bestowed on the winter residence of
the Sassinadees; and the whole circumference of the Persian capital was
strongly fortified by the waters of the river, by lofty walls, and by
impracticable morasses. Near the ruins of Seleucia, the camp of Julian
was fixed, and secured, by a ditch and rampart, against the sallies of
the numerous and enterprising garrison of Coche. In this fruitful and
pleasant country, the Romans were plentifully supplied with water and
forage: and several forts, which might have embarrassed the motions
of the army, submitted, after some resistance, to the efforts of their
valor. The fleet passed from the Euphrates into an artificial derivation
of that river, which pours a copious and navigable stream into the
Tigris, at a small distance below the great city. If they had followed
this royal canal, which bore the name of Nahar-Malcha, <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> the
intermediate situation of Coche would have separated the fleet and army
of Julian; and the rash attempt of steering against the current of the
Tigris, and forcing their way through the midst of a hostile capital,
must have been attended with the total destruction of the Roman navy.
The prudence of the emperor foresaw the danger, and provided the remedy.
As he had minutely studied the operations of Trajan in the same country,
he soon recollected that his warlike predecessor had dug a new and
navigable canal, which, leaving Coche on the right hand, conveyed the
waters of the Nahar-Malcha into the river Tigris, at some distance above
the cities. From the information of the peasants, Julian ascertained the
vestiges of this ancient work, which were almost obliterated by design
or accident. By the indefatigable labor of the soldiers, a broad and
deep channel was speedily prepared for the reception of the Euphrates.
A strong dike was constructed to interrupt the ordinary current of the
Nahar-Malcha: a flood of waters rushed impetuously into their new bed;
and the Roman fleet, steering their triumphant course into the Tigris,
derided the vain and ineffectual barriers which the Persians of
Ctesiphon had erected to oppose their passage.

<p>
As it became necessary to transport the Roman army over the Tigris,
another labor presented itself, of less toil, but of more danger, than
the preceding expedition. The stream was broad and rapid; the ascent
steep and difficult; and the intrenchments which had been formed on the
ridge of the opposite bank, were lined with a numerous army of heavy
cuirrasiers, dexterous archers, and huge elephants; who (according to
the extravagant hyperbole of Libanius) could trample with the same ease
a field of corn, or a legion of Romans. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> In the presence of such an
enemy, the construction of a bridge was impracticable; and the intrepid
prince, who instantly seized the only possible expedient, concealed
his design, till the moment of execution, from the knowledge of the
Barbarians, of his own troops, and even of his generals themselves.
Under the specious pretence of examining the state of the magazines,
fourscore vessels <a href="#note-6711" name="noteref-6711"><small>6711</small></a> were gradually unladen; and a select detachment,
apparently destined for some secret expedition, was ordered to stand to
their arms on the first signal. Julian disguised the silent anxiety of
his own mind with smiles of confidence and joy; and amused the hostile
nations with the spectacle of military games, which he insultingly
celebrated under the walls of Coche. The day was consecrated to
pleasure; but, as soon as the hour of supper was passed, the emperor
summoned the generals to his tent, and acquainted them that he had
fixed that night for the passage of the Tigris. They stood in silent
and respectful astonishment; but, when the venerable Sallust assumed the
privilege of his age and experience, the rest of the chiefs supported
with freedom the weight of his prudent remonstrances. <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> Julian
contented himself with observing, that conquest and safety depended on
the attempt; that instead of diminishing, the number of their enemies
would be increased, by successive reenforcements; and that a longer
delay would neither contract the breadth of the stream, nor level the
height of the bank. The signal was instantly given, and obeyed; the most
impatient of the legionaries leaped into five vessels that lay nearest
to the bank; and as they plied their oars with intrepid diligence, they
were lost, after a few moments, in the darkness of the night. A flame
arose on the opposite side; and Julian, who too clearly understood
that his foremost vessels, in attempting to land, had been fired by
the enemy, dexterously converted their extreme danger into a presage
of victory. "Our fellow-soldiers," he eagerly exclaimed, "are already
masters of the bank; see&mdash;they make the appointed signal; let us hasten
to emulate and assist their courage." The united and rapid motion of
a great fleet broke the violence of the current, and they reached the
eastern shore of the Tigris with sufficient speed to extinguish the
flames, and rescue their adventurous companions. The difficulties of a
steep and lofty ascent were increased by the weight of armor, and
the darkness of the night. A shower of stones, darts, and fire, was
incessantly discharged on the heads of the assailants; who, after
an arduous struggle, climbed the bank and stood victorious upon the
rampart. As soon as they possessed a more equal field, Julian, who, with
his light infantry, had led the attack, <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> darted through the ranks
a skilful and experienced eye: his bravest soldiers, according to the
precepts of Homer, <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> were distributed in the front and rear: and all
the trumpets of the Imperial army sounded to battle. The Romans, after
sending up a military shout, advanced in measured steps to the animating
notes of martial music; launched their formidable javelins; and rushed
forwards with drawn swords, to deprive the Barbarians, by a closer
onset, of the advantage of their missile weapons. The whole engagement
lasted above twelve hours; till the gradual retreat of the Persians
was changed into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example
was given by the principal leader, and the Surenas himself. They were
pursued to the gates of Ctesiphon; and the conquerors might have entered
the dismayed city, <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a> if their general, Victor, who was dangerously
wounded with an arrow, had not conjured them to desist from a rash
attempt, which must be fatal, if it were not successful. On their side,
the Romans acknowledged the loss of only seventy-five men; while they
affirmed, that the Barbarians had left on the field of battle two
thousand five hundred, or even six thousand, of their bravest soldiers.
The spoil was such as might be expected from the riches and luxury of
an Oriental camp; large quantities of silver and gold, splendid arms
and trappings, and beds and tables of massy silver. <a href="#note-7111" name="noteref-7111"><small>7111</small></a> The victorious
emperor distributed, as the rewards of valor, some honorable gifts,
civic, and mural, and naval crowns; which he, and perhaps he alone,
esteemed more precious than the wealth of Asia. A solemn sacrifice was
offered to the god of war, but the appearances of the victims threatened
the most inauspicious events; and Julian soon discovered, by less
ambiguous signs, that he had now reached the term of his prosperity.

On the second day after the battle, the domestic guards, the Jovians and
Herculians, and the remaining troops, which composed near two thirds
of the whole army, were securely wafted over the Tigris. <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> While
the Persians beheld from the walls of Ctesiphon the desolation of the
adjacent country, Julian cast many an anxious look towards the North, in
full expectation, that as he himself had victoriously penetrated to the
capital of Sapor, the march and junction of his lieutenants, Sebastian
and Procopius, would be executed with the same courage and diligence.
His expectations were disappointed by the treachery of the Armenian
king, who permitted, and most probably directed, the desertion of
his auxiliary troops from the camp of the Romans; <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a> and by the
dissensions of the two generals, who were incapable of forming or
executing any plan for the public service. When the emperor had
relinquished the hope of this important reenforcement, he condescended
to hold a council of war, and approved, after a full debate, the
sentiment of those generals, who dissuaded the siege of Ctesiphon, as a
fruitless and pernicious undertaking. It is not easy for us to conceive,
by what arts of fortification a city thrice besieged and taken by the
predecessors of Julian could be rendered impregnable against an army of
sixty thousand Romans, commanded by a brave and experienced general,
and abundantly supplied with ships, provisions, battering engines, and
military stores. But we may rest assured, from the love of glory, and
contempt of danger, which formed the character of Julian, that he was
not discouraged by any trivial or imaginary obstacles. <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> At the
very time when he declined the siege of Ctesiphon, he rejected, with
obstinacy and disdain, the most flattering offers of a negotiation of
peace. Sapor, who had been so long accustomed to the tardy ostentation
of Constantius, was surprised by the intrepid diligence of his
successor. As far as the confines of India and Scythia, the satraps
of the distant provinces were ordered to assemble their troops, and
to march, without delay, to the assistance of their monarch. But their
preparations were dilatory, their motions slow; and before Sapor could
lead an army into the field, he received the melancholy intelligence of
the devastation of Assyria, the ruin of his palaces, and the slaughter
of his bravest troops, who defended the passage of the Tigris. The pride
of royalty was humbled in the dust; he took his repasts on the ground;
and the disorder of his hair expressed the grief and anxiety of his
mind. Perhaps he would not have refused to purchase, with one half
of his kingdom, the safety of the remainder; and he would have gladly
subscribed himself, in a treaty of peace, the faithful and dependent
ally of the Roman conqueror. Under the pretence of private business, a
minister of rank and confidence was secretly despatched to embrace the
knees of Hormisdas, and to request, in the language of a suppliant, that
he might be introduced into the presence of the emperor. The Sassanian
prince, whether he listened to the voice of pride or humanity,
whether he consulted the sentiments of his birth, or the duties of his
situation, was equally inclined to promote a salutary measure, which
would terminate the calamities of Persia, and secure the triumph of
Rome. He was astonished by the inflexible firmness of a hero, who
remembered, most unfortunately for himself and for his country, that
Alexander had uniformly rejected the propositions of Darius. But as
Julian was sensible, that the hope of a safe and honorable peace might
cool the ardor of his troops, he earnestly requested that Hormisdas
would privately dismiss the minister of Sapor, and conceal this
dangerous temptation from the knowledge of the camp. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
The honor, as well as interest, of Julian, forbade him to consume his
time under the impregnable walls of Ctesiphon and as often as he defied
the Barbarians, who defended the city, to meet him on the open plain,
they prudently replied, that if he desired to exercise his valor,
he might seek the army of the Great King. He felt the insult, and he
accepted the advice. Instead of confining his servile march to the banks
of the Euphrates and Tigris, he resolved to imitate the adventurous
spirit of Alexander, and boldly to advance into the inland provinces,
till he forced his rival to contend with him, perhaps in the plains of
Arbela, for the empire of Asia. The magnanimity of Julian was applauded
and betrayed, by the arts of a noble Persian, who, in the cause of
his country, had generously submitted to act a part full of danger, of
falsehood, and of shame. <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> With a train of faithful followers, he
deserted to the Imperial camp; exposed, in a specious tale, the injuries
which he had sustained; exaggerated the cruelty of Sapor, the discontent
of the people, and the weakness of the monarchy; and confidently offered
himself as the hostage and guide of the Roman march. The most rational
grounds of suspicion were urged, without effect, by the wisdom and
experience of Hormisdas; and the credulous Julian, receiving the traitor
into his bosom, was persuaded to issue a hasty order, which, in the
opinion of mankind, appeared to arraign his prudence, and to endanger
his safety. He destroyed, in a single hour, the whole navy, which had
been transported above five hundred miles, at so great an expense of
toil, of treasure, and of blood. Twelve, or, at the most, twenty-two
small vessels were saved, to accompany, on carriages, the march of the
army, and to form occasional bridges for the passage of the rivers.
A supply of twenty days' provisions was reserved for the use of the
soldiers; and the rest of the magazines, with a fleet of eleven hundred
vessels, which rode at anchor in the Tigris, were abandoned to the
flames, by the absolute command of the emperor. The Christian bishops,
Gregory and Augustin, insult the madness of the Apostate, who executed,
with his own hands, the sentence of divine justice. Their authority, of
less weight, perhaps, in a military question, is confirmed by the cool
judgment of an experienced soldier, who was himself spectator of the
conflagration, and who could not disapprove the reluctant murmurs of the
troops. <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> Yet there are not wanting some specious, and perhaps solid,
reasons, which might justify the resolution of Julian. The navigation of
the Euphrates never ascended above Babylon, nor that of the Tigris above
Opis. <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> The distance of the last-mentioned city from the Roman camp
was not very considerable: and Julian must soon have renounced the vain
and impracticable attempt of forcing upwards a great fleet against the
stream of a rapid river, <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> which in several places was embarrassed
by natural or artificial cataracts. <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> The power of sails and oars was
insufficient; it became necessary to tow the ships against the current
of the river; the strength of twenty thousand soldiers was exhausted
in this tedious and servile labor, and if the Romans continued to march
along the banks of the Tigris, they could only expect to return home
without achieving any enterprise worthy of the genius or fortune of
their leader. If, on the contrary, it was advisable to advance into the
inland country, the destruction of the fleet and magazines was the
only measure which could save that valuable prize from the hands of the
numerous and active troops which might suddenly be poured from the gates
of Ctesiphon. Had the arms of Julian been victorious, we should now
admire the conduct, as well as the courage, of a hero, who, by depriving
his soldiers of the hopes of a retreat, left them only the alternative
of death or conquest. <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a>

general; and that subsistence could only be drawn from his own or from

darkened with swarms of innumerable insects. <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> The appearance of the
hostile country was far more inviting. The extensive region that lies
between the River Tigris and the mountains of Media, was filled with
villages and towns; and the fertile soil, for the most part, was in
a very improved state of cultivation. Julian might expect, that a
conqueror, who possessed the two forcible instruments of persuasion,
steel and gold, would easily procure a plentiful subsistence from the
fears or avarice of the natives. But, on the approach of the Romans, the
rich and smiling prospect was instantly blasted. Wherever they moved,
the inhabitants deserted the open villages, and took shelter in the
fortified towns; the cattle was driven away; the grass and ripe corn
were consumed with fire; and, as soon as the flames had subsided which
interrupted the march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of a
smoking and naked desert. This desperate but effectual method of defence
can only be executed by the enthusiasm of a people who prefer their
independence to their property; or by the rigor of an arbitrary
government, which consults the public safety without submitting to their
inclinations the liberty of choice. On the present occasion the zeal
and obedience of the Persians seconded the commands of Sapor; and
the emperor was soon reduced to the scanty stock of provisions, which
continually wasted in his hands. Before they were entirely consumed, he
might still have reached the wealthy and unwarlike cities of Ecbatana or
Susa, by the effort of a rapid and well-directed march; <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a> but he was
deprived of this last resource by his ignorance of the roads, and by the
perfidy of his guides. The Romans wandered several days in the country
to the eastward of Bagdad; the Persian deserter, who had artfully led
them into the spare, escaped from their resentment; and his followers,
as soon as they were put to the torture, confessed the secret of the
conspiracy. The visionary conquests of Hyrcania and India, which had so
long amused, now tormented, the mind of Julian. Conscious that his own
imprudence was the cause of the public distress, he anxiously balanced
the hopes of safety or success, without obtaining a satisfactory answer,
either from gods or men. At length, as the only practicable measure, he
embraced the resolution of directing his steps towards the banks of
the Tigris, with the design of saving the army by a hasty march to
the confines of Corduene; a fertile and friendly province, which
acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome. The desponding troops obeyed
the signal of the retreat, only seventy days after they had passed the
Chaboras, with the sanguine expectation of subverting the throne of
Persia. <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a>

As long as the Romans seemed to advance into the country, their march
was observed and insulted from a distance, by several bodies of Persian
cavalry; who, showing themselves sometimes in loose, and sometimes
in close order, faintly skirmished with the advanced guards. These
detachments were, however, supported by a much greater force; and the
heads of the columns were no sooner pointed towards the Tigris than a
cloud of dust arose on the plain. The Romans, who now aspired only to
the permission of a safe and speedy retreat, endeavored to persuade
themselves, that this formidable appearance was occasioned by a troop
of wild asses, or perhaps by the approach of some friendly Arabs. They
halted, pitched their tents, fortified their camp, passed the whole
night in continual alarms; and discovered at the dawn of day, that
they were surrounded by an army of Persians. This army, which might be
considered only as the van of the Barbarians, was soon followed by the
main body of cuirassiers, archers, and elephants, commanded by Meranes,
a general of rank and reputation. He was accompanied by two of the
king's sons, and many of the principal satraps; and fame and expectation
exaggerated the strength of the remaining powers, which slowly advanced
under the conduct of Sapor himself. As the Romans continued their march,
their long array, which was forced to bend or divide, according to the
varieties of the ground, afforded frequent and favorable opportunities
to their vigilant enemies. The Persians repeatedly charged with fury;
they were repeatedly repulsed with firmness; and the action at Maronga,
which almost deserved the name of a battle, was marked by a considerable
loss of satraps and elephants, perhaps of equal value in the eyes of
their monarch. These splendid advantages were not obtained without
an adequate slaughter on the side of the Romans: several officers of
distinction were either killed or wounded; and the emperor himself, who,
on all occasions of danger, inspired and guided the valor of his troops,
was obliged to expose his person, and exert his abilities. The weight of
offensive and defensive arms, which still constituted the strength and
safety of the Romans, disabled them from making any long or effectual
pursuit; and as the horsemen of the East were trained to dart their
javelins, and shoot their arrows, at full speed, and in every possible
direction, <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> the cavalry of Persia was never more formidable than in
the moment of a rapid and disorderly flight. But the most certain and
irreparable loss of the Romans was that of time. The hardy veterans,
accustomed to the cold climate of Gaul and Germany, fainted under the
sultry heat of an Assyrian summer; their vigor was exhausted by the
incessant repetition of march and combat; and the progress of the army
was suspended by the precautions of a slow and dangerous retreat, in
the presence of an active enemy. Every day, every hour, as the supply
diminished, the value and price of subsistence increased in the Roman
camp. <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> Julian, who always contented himself with such food as a
hungry soldier would have disdained, distributed, for the use of the
troops, the provisions of the Imperial household, and whatever could be
spared, from the sumpter-horses, of the tribunes and generals. But this
feeble relief served only to aggravate the sense of the public distress;
and the Romans began to entertain the most gloomy apprehensions that,
before they could reach the frontiers of the empire, they should all
perish, either by famine, or by the sword of the Barbarians. <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a>

While Julian struggled with the almost insuperable difficulties of his
situation, the silent hours of the night were still devoted to study
and contemplation. Whenever he closed his eyes in short and interrupted
slumbers, his mind was agitated with painful anxiety; nor can it be
thought surprising, that the Genius of the empire should once more
appear before him, covering with a funeral veil his head, and his horn
of abundance, and slowly retiring from the Imperial tent. The monarch
started from his couch, and stepping forth to refresh his wearied
spirits with the coolness of the midnight air, he beheld a fiery meteor,
which shot athwart the sky, and suddenly vanished. Julian was convinced
that he had seen the menacing countenance of the god of war; <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a>
the council which he summoned, of Tuscan Haruspices, <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> unanimously
pronounced that he should abstain from action; but on this occasion,
necessity and reason were more prevalent than superstition; and the
trumpets sounded at the break of day. The army marched through a hilly
country; and the hills had been secretly occupied by the Persians.
Julian led the van with the skill and attention of a consummate general;
he was alarmed by the intelligence that his rear was suddenly attacked.
The heat of the weather had tempted him to lay aside his cuirass; but
he snatched a shield from one of his attendants, and hastened, with a
sufficient reenforcement, to the relief of the rear-guard. A similar
danger recalled the intrepid prince to the defence of the front; and,
as he galloped through the columns, the centre of the left was attacked,
and almost overpowered by the furious charge of the Persian cavalry and
elephants. This huge body was soon defeated, by the well-timed evolution
of the light infantry, who aimed their weapons, with dexterity
and effect, against the backs of the horsemen, and the legs of the
elephants. The Barbarians fled; and Julian, who was foremost in every
danger, animated the pursuit with his voice and gestures. His trembling
guards, scattered and oppressed by the disorderly throng of friends and
enemies, reminded their fearless sovereign that he was without armor;
and conjured him to decline the fall of the impending ruin. As they
exclaimed, <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> a cloud of darts and arrows was discharged from the
flying squadrons; and a javelin, after razing the skin of his arm,
transpierced the ribs, and fixed in the inferior part of the liver.
Julian attempted to draw the deadly weapon from his side; but his
fingers were cut by the sharpness of the steel, and he fell senseless
from his horse. His guards flew to his relief; and the wounded emperor
was gently raised from the ground, and conveyed out of the tumult of the
battle into an adjacent tent. The report of the melancholy event passed
from rank to rank; but the grief of the Romans inspired them with
invincible valor, and the desire of revenge. The bloody and obstinate
conflict was maintained by the two armies, till they were separated by
the total darkness of the night. The Persians derived some honor
from the advantage which they obtained against the left wing, where
Anatolius, master of the offices, was slain, and the praefect Sallust
very narrowly escaped. But the event of the day was adverse to the
Barbarians. They abandoned the field; their two generals, Meranes and
Nohordates, <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> fifty nobles or satraps, and a multitude of their
bravest soldiers; and the success of the Romans, if Julian had survived,
might have been improved into a decisive and useful victory.

The first words that Julian uttered, after his recovery from the
fainting fit into which he had been thrown by loss of blood, were
expressive of his martial spirit. He called for his horse and arms,
and was impatient to rush into the battle. His remaining strength was
exhausted by the painful effort; and the surgeons, who examined his
wound, discovered the symptoms of approaching death. He employed
the awful moments with the firm temper of a hero and a sage; the
philosophers who had accompanied him in this fatal expedition, compared
the tent of Julian with the prison of Socrates; and the spectators,
whom duty, or friendship, or curiosity, had assembled round his couch,
listened with respectful grief to the funeral oration of their dying
emperor. <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> "Friends and fellow-soldiers, the seasonable period of my
departure is now arrived, and I discharge, with the cheerfulness of a
ready debtor, the demands of nature. I have learned from philosophy, how
much the soul is more excellent than the body; and that the separation
of the nobler substance should be the subject of joy, rather than of
affliction. I have learned from religion, that an early death has often
been the reward of piety; <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> and I accept, as a favor of the gods, the
mortal stroke that secures me from the danger of disgracing a character,
which has hitherto been supported by virtue and fortitude. I die without
remorse, as I have lived without guilt. I am pleased to reflect on the
innocence of my private life; and I can affirm with confidence, that
the supreme authority, that emanation of the Divine Power, has been
preserved in my hands pure and immaculate. Detesting the corrupt and
destructive maxims of despotism, I have considered the happiness of the
people as the end of government. Submitting my actions to the laws of
prudence, of justice, and of moderation, I have trusted the event to
the care of Providence. Peace was the object of my counsels, as long
as peace was consistent with the public welfare; but when the imperious
voice of my country summoned me to arms, I exposed my person to the
dangers of war, with the clear foreknowledge (which I had acquired from
the art of divination) that I was destined to fall by the sword. I now
offer my tribute of gratitude to the Eternal Being, who has not suffered
me to perish by the cruelty of a tyrant, by the secret dagger of
conspiracy, or by the slow tortures of lingering disease. He has
given me, in the midst of an honorable career, a splendid and glorious
departure from this world; and I hold it equally absurd, equally
base, to solicit, or to decline, the stroke of fate. This much I have
attempted to say; but my strength fails me, and I feel the approach
of death. I shall cautiously refrain from any word that may tend to
influence your suffrages in the election of an emperor. My choice might
be imprudent or injudicious; and if it should not be ratified by the
consent of the army, it might be fatal to the person whom I should
recommend. I shall only, as a good citizen, express my hopes, that the
Romans may be blessed with the government of a virtuous sovereign."
After this discourse, which Julian pronounced in a firm and gentle tone
of voice, he distributed, by a military testament, <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> the remains
of his private fortune; and making some inquiry why Anatolius was not
present, he understood, from the answer of Sallust, that Anatolius
was killed; and bewailed, with amiable inconsistency, the loss of
his friend. At the same time he reproved the immoderate grief of the
spectators; and conjured them not to disgrace, by unmanly tears, the
fate of a prince, who in a few moments would be united with heaven, and
with the stars. <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a> The spectators were silent; and Julian entered into
a metaphysical argument with the philosophers Priscus and Maximus, on
the nature of the soul. The efforts which he made, of mind as well as
body, most probably hastened his death. His wound began to bleed with
fresh violence; his respiration was embarrassed by the swelling of the
veins; he called for a draught of cold water, and, as soon as he had
drank it, expired without pain, about the hour of midnight. Such was
the end of that extraordinary man, in the thirty-second year of his
age, after a reign of one year and about eight months, from the death
of Constantius. In his last moments he displayed, perhaps with some
ostentation, the love of virtue and of fame, which had been the ruling
passions of his life. <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a>

</p>
<p>
The triumph of Christianity, and the calamities of the empire, may, in
some measure, be ascribed to Julian himself, who had neglected to
secure the future execution of his designs, by the timely and judicious
nomination of an associate and successor. But the royal race of
Constantius Chlorus was reduced to his own person; and if he entertained
any serious thoughts of investing with the purple the most worthy among
the Romans, he was diverted from his resolution by the difficulty of the
choice, the jealousy of power, the fear of ingratitude, and the natural
presumption of health, of youth, and of prosperity. His unexpected death
left the empire without a master, and without an heir, in a state of
perplexity and danger, which, in the space of fourscore years, had never
been experienced, since the election of Diocletian. In a government
which had almost forgotten the distinction of pure and noble blood, the
superiority of birth was of little moment; the claims of official rank
were accidental and precarious; and the candidates, who might aspire to
ascend the vacant throne could be supported only by the consciousness of
personal merit, or by the hopes of popular favor. But the situation of
a famished army, encompassed on all sides by a host of Barbarians,
shortened the moments of grief and deliberation. In this scene of terror
and distress, the body of the deceased prince, according to his own
directions, was decently embalmed; and, at the dawn of day, the generals
convened a military senate, at which the commanders of the legions, and
the officers both of cavalry and infantry, were invited to assist.
Three or four hours of the night had not passed away without some secret
cabals; and when the election of an emperor was proposed, the spirit of
faction began to agitate the assembly. Victor and Arinthaeus collected
the remains of the court of Constantius; the friends of Julian attached
themselves to the Gallic chiefs, Dagalaiphus and Nevitta; and the
most fatal consequences might be apprehended from the discord of two
factions, so opposite in their character and interest, in their maxims
of government, and perhaps in their religious principles. The superior
virtues of Sallust could alone reconcile their divisions, and unite
their suffrages; and the venerable praefect would immediately have been
declared the successor of Julian, if he himself, with sincere and modest
firmness, had not alleged his age and infirmities, so unequal to the
weight of the diadem. The generals, who were surprised and perplexed by
his refusal, showed some disposition to adopt the salutary advice of an
inferior officer, <a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a> that they should act as they would have acted
in the absence of the emperor; that they should exert their abilities
to extricate the army from the present distress; and, if they were
fortunate enough to reach the confines of Mesopotamia, they should
proceed with united and deliberate counsels in the election of a lawful
sovereign. While they debated, a few voices saluted Jovian, who was no
more than first <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a> of the domestics, with the names of Emperor and
Augustus. The tumultuary acclamation <a href="#note-10111" name="noteref-10111"><small>10111</small></a> was instantly repeated by
the guards who surrounded the tent, and passed, in a few minutes, to the
extremities of the line. The new prince, astonished with his own fortune
was hastily invested with the Imperial ornaments, and received an oath
of fidelity from the generals, whose favor and protection he so lately
solicited. The strongest recommendation of Jovian was the merit of his
father, Count Varronian, who enjoyed, in honorable retirement, the fruit
of his long services. In the obscure freedom of a private station,
the son indulged his taste for wine and women; yet he supported, with
credit, the character of a Christian <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a> and a soldier. Without being
conspicuous for any of the ambitious qualifications which excite
the admiration and envy of mankind, the comely person of Jovian, his
cheerful temper, and familiar wit, had gained the affection of his
fellow-soldiers; and the generals of both parties acquiesced in a
popular election, which had not been conducted by the arts of their
enemies. The pride of this unexpected elevation was moderated by the
just apprehension, that the same day might terminate the life and reign
of the new emperor. The pressing voice of necessity was obeyed without
delay; and the first orders issued by Jovian, a few hours after his
predecessor had expired, were to prosecute a march, which could alone
extricate the Romans from their actual distress. <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter XXIV: The Retreat And Death Of Julian.&mdash;Part V.
</h2>
<p>
The esteem of an enemy is most sincerely expressed by his fears; and
the degree of fear may be accurately measured by the joy with which he
celebrates his deliverance. The welcome news of the death of Julian,
which a deserter revealed to the camp of Sapor, inspired the desponding
monarch with a sudden confidence of victory. He immediately detached the
royal cavalry, perhaps the ten thousand Immortals, <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a> to second
and support the pursuit; and discharged the whole weight of his united
forces on the rear-guard of the Romans. The rear-guard was thrown
into disorder; the renowned legions, which derived their titles from
Diocletian, and his warlike colleague, were broke and trampled down by
the elephants; and three tribunes lost their lives in attempting to stop
the flight of their soldiers. The battle was at length restored by the
persevering valor of the Romans; the Persians were repulsed with a
great slaughter of men and elephants; and the army, after marching and
fighting a long summer's day, arrived, in the evening, at Samara, on the
banks of the Tigris, about one hundred miles above Ctesiphon. <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a>
On the ensuing day, the Barbarians, instead of harassing the march,
attacked the camp, of Jovian; which had been seated in a deep and
sequestered valley. From the hills, the archers of Persia insulted
and annoyed the wearied legionaries; and a body of cavalry, which had
penetrated with desperate courage through the Praetorian gate, was cut
in pieces, after a doubtful conflict, near the Imperial tent. In the
succeeding night, the camp of Carche was protected by the lofty dikes
of the river; and the Roman army, though incessantly exposed to the
vexatious pursuit of the Saracens, pitched their tents near the city of
Dura, <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a> four days after the death of Julian. The Tigris was still
on their left; their hopes and provisions were almost consumed; and
the impatient soldiers, who had fondly persuaded themselves that the
frontiers of the empire were not far distant, requested their new
sovereign, that they might be permitted to hazard the passage of the
river. With the assistance of his wisest officers, Jovian endeavored to
check their rashness; by representing, that if they possessed sufficient
skill and vigor to stem the torrent of a deep and rapid stream, they
would only deliver themselves naked and defenceless to the Barbarians,
who had occupied the opposite banks, Yielding at length to their
clamorous importunities, he consented, with reluctance, that five
hundred Gauls and Germans, accustomed from their infancy to the waters
of the Rhine and Danube, should attempt the bold adventure, which might
serve either as an encouragement, or as a warning, for the rest of the
army. In the silence of the night, they swam the Tigris, surprised an
unguarded post of the enemy, and displayed at the dawn of day the signal
of their resolution and fortune. The success of this trial disposed
the emperor to listen to the promises of his architects, who propose to
construct a floating bridge of the inflated skins of sheep, oxen, and
goats, covered with a floor of earth and fascines. <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a> Two important
days were spent in the ineffectual labor; and the Romans, who already
endured the miseries of famine, cast a look of despair on the Tigris,
and upon the Barbarians; whose numbers and obstinacy increased with the
distress of the Imperial army. <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a>

and Zosimus, (l. iii. p. 189, 190, 191.) Though we may distrust the
fairness of Libanius, the ocular testimony of Eutropius (uno a Persis
atque altero proelio victus, x. 17) must incline us to suspect that
Ammianus had been too jealous of the honor of the Roman arms.]
</p>
<p>
In this hopeless condition, the fainting spirits of the Romans were
revived by the sound of peace. The transient presumption of Sapor had
vanished: he observed, with serious concern, that, in the repetition of
doubtful combats, he had lost his most faithful and intrepid nobles, his
bravest troops, and the greatest part of his train of elephants: and
the experienced monarch feared to provoke the resistance of despair, the
vicissitudes of fortune, and the unexhausted powers of the Roman empire;
which might soon advance to elieve, or to revenge, the successor of
Julian. The Surenas himself, accompanied by another satrap, appeared
in the camp of Jovian; <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a> and declared, that the clemency of his
sovereign was not averse to signify the conditions on which he would
consent to spare and to dismiss the Caesar with the relics of his
captive army. <a href="#note-10911" name="noteref-10911"><small>10911</small></a> The hopes of safety subdued the firmness of the
Romans; the emperor was compelled, by the advice of his council, and
the cries of his soldiers, to embrace the offer of peace; <a href="#note-10912" 
name="noteref-10912"><small>10912</small></a> and the
praefect Sallust was immediately sent, with the general Arinthaeus, to
understand the pleasure of the Great King. The crafty Persian delayed,
under various pretenses, the conclusion of the agreement; started
difficulties, required explanations, suggested expedients, receded from
his concessions, increased his demands, and wasted four days in the arts
of negotiation, till he had consumed the stock of provisions which yet
remained in the camp of the Romans. Had Jovian been capable of executing
a bold and prudent measure, he would have continued his march, with
unremitting diligence; the progress of the treaty would have suspended
the attacks of the Barbarians; and, before the expiration of the fourth
day, he might have safely reached the fruitful province of Corduene, at
the distance only of one hundred miles. <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> The irresolute emperor,
instead of breaking through the toils of the enemy, expected his fate
with patient resignation; and accepted the humiliating conditions of
peace, which it was no longer in his power to refuse. The five provinces
beyond the Tigris, which had been ceded by the grandfather of Sapor,
were restored to the Persian monarchy. He acquired, by a single
article, the impregnable city of Nisibis; which had sustained, in three
successive sieges, the effort of his arms. Singara, and the castle of
the Moors, one of the strongest places of Mesopotamia, were likewise
dismembered from the empire. It was considered as an indulgence, that
the inhabitants of those fortresses were permitted to retire with their
effects; but the conqueror rigorously insisted, that the Romans should
forever abandon the king and kingdom of Armenia. <a href="#note-11011" name="noteref-11011"><small>11011</small></a> A peace, or
rather a long truce, of thirty years, was stipulated between the hostile
nations; the faith of the treaty was ratified by solemn oaths
and religious ceremonies; and hostages of distinguished rank were
reciprocally delivered to secure the performance of the conditions.

</p>
<p>
The sophist of Antioch, who saw with indignation the sceptre of his hero
in the feeble hand of a Christian successor, professes to admire the
moderation of Sapor, in contenting himself with so small a portion of
the Roman empire. If he had stretched as far as the Euphrates the
claims of his ambition, he might have been secure, says Libanius, of not
meeting with a refusal. If he had fixed, as the boundary of Persia,
the Orontes, the Cydnus, the Sangarius, or even the Thracian Bosphorus,
flatterers would not have been wanting in the court of Jovian to
convince the timid monarch, that his remaining provinces would still
afford the most ample gratifications of power and luxury. <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a>
Without adopting in its full force this malicious insinuation, we
must acknowledge, that the conclusion of so ignominious a treaty was
facilitated by the private ambition of Jovian. The obscure domestic,
exalted to the throne by fortune, rather than by merit, was impatient to
escape from the hands of the Persians, that he might prevent the designs
of Procopius, who commanded the army of Mesopotamia, and establish his
doubtful reign over the legions and provinces which were still ignorant
of the hasty and tumultuous choice of the camp beyond the Tigris. <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a>
In the neighborhood of the same river, at no very considerable distance
from the fatal station of Dura, <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a> the ten thousand Greeks, without
generals, or guides, or provisions, were abandoned, above twelve hundred
miles from their native country, to the resentment of a victorious
monarch. The difference of their conduct and success depended much more
on their character than on their situation. Instead of tamely resigning
themselves to the secret deliberations and private views of a single
person, the united councils of the Greeks were inspired by the generous
enthusiasm of a popular assembly; where the mind of each citizen is
filled with the love of glory, the pride of freedom, and the contempt
of death. Conscious of their superiority over the Barbarians in arms and
discipline, they disdained to yield, they refused to capitulate: every
obstacle was surmounted by their patience, courage, and military skill;
and the memorable retreat of the ten thousand exposed and insulted the
weakness of the Persian monarchy. <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a>

As the price of his disgraceful concessions, the emperor might
perhaps have stipulated, that the camp of the hungry Romans should be
plentifully supplied; <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a> and that they should be permitted to pass
the Tigris on the bridge which was constructed by the hands of the
Persians. But, if Jovian presumed to solicit those equitable terms, they
were sternly refused by the haughty tyrant of the East, whose clemency
had pardoned the invaders of his country. The Saracens sometimes
intercepted the stragglers of the march; but the generals and troops
of Sapor respected the cessation of arms; and Jovian was suffered to
explore the most convenient place for the passage of the river. The
small vessels, which had been saved from the conflagration of the fleet,
performed the most essential service. They first conveyed the emperor
and his favorites; and afterwards transported, in many successive
voyages, a great part of the army. But, as every man was anxious for his
personal safety, and apprehensive of being left on the hostile shore,
the soldiers, who were too impatient to wait the slow returns of the
boats, boldly ventured themselves on light hurdles, or inflated skins;
and, drawing after them their horses, attempted, with various success,
to swim across the river. Many of these daring adventurers were
swallowed by the waves; many others, who were carried along by the
violence of the stream, fell an easy prey to the avarice or cruelty of
the wild Arabs: and the loss which the army sustained in the passage of
the Tigris, was not inferior to the carnage of a day of battle. As soon
as the Romans were landed on the western bank, they were delivered from
the hostile pursuit of the Barbarians; but, in a laborious march of
two hundred miles over the plains of Mesopotamia, they endured the last
extremities of thirst and hunger. They were obliged to traverse the
sandy desert, which, in the extent of seventy miles, did not afford a
single blade of sweet grass, nor a single spring of fresh water; and
the rest of the inhospitable waste was untrod by the footsteps either
of friends or enemies. Whenever a small measure of flour could be
discovered in the camp, twenty pounds weight were greedily purchased
with ten pieces of gold: <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a> the beasts of burden were slaughtered and
devoured; and the desert was strewed with the arms and baggage of
the Roman soldiers, whose tattered garments and meagre countenances
displayed their past sufferings and actual misery. A small convoy of
provisions advanced to meet the army as far as the castle of Ur; and
the supply was the more grateful, since it declared the fidelity
of Sebastian and Procopius. At Thilsaphata, <a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a> the emperor most
graciously received the generals of Mesopotamia; and the remains of a
once flourishing army at length reposed themselves under the walls
of Nisibis. The messengers of Jovian had already proclaimed, in the
language of flattery, his election, his treaty, and his return; and
the new prince had taken the most effectual measures to secure the
allegiance of the armies and provinces of Europe, by placing the
military command in the hands of those officers, who, from motives
of interest, or inclination, would firmly support the cause of their
benefactor. <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a>

The friends of Julian had confidently announced the success of his
expedition. They entertained a fond persuasion that the temples of the
gods would be enriched with the spoils of the East; that Persia would
be reduced to the humble state of a tributary province, governed by the
laws and magistrates of Rome; that the Barbarians would adopt the dress,
and manners, and language of their conquerors; and that the youth of
Ecbatana and Susa would study the art of rhetoric under Grecian masters.
<a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a> The progress of the arms of Julian interrupted his communication
with the empire; and, from the moment that he passed the Tigris, his
affectionate subjects were ignorant of the fate and fortunes of their
prince. Their contemplation of fancied triumphs was disturbed by the
melancholy rumor of his death; and they persisted to doubt, after
they could no longer deny, the truth of that fatal event. <a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a> The
messengers of Jovian promulgated the specious tale of a prudent and
necessary peace; the voice of fame, louder and more sincere, revealed
the disgrace of the emperor, and the conditions of the ignominious
treaty. The minds of the people were filled with astonishment and grief,
with indignation and terror, when they were informed, that the unworthy
successor of Julian relinquished the five provinces which had been
acquired by the victory of Galerius; and that he shamefully surrendered
to the Barbarians the important city of Nisibis, the firmest bulwark of
the provinces of the East. <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a> The deep and dangerous question, how
far the public faith should be observed, when it becomes incompatible
with the public safety, was freely agitated in popular conversation;
and some hopes were entertained that the emperor would redeem his
pusillanimous behavior by a splendid act of patriotic perfidy. The
inflexible spirit of the Roman senate had always disclaimed the unequal
conditions which were extorted from the distress of their captive
armies; and, if it were necessary to satisfy the national honor, by
delivering the guilty general into the hands of the Barbarians, the
greatest part of the subjects of Jovian would have cheerfully acquiesced
in the precedent of ancient times. <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a>

But the emperor, whatever might be the limits of his constitutional
authority, was the absolute master of the laws and arms of the state;
and the same motives which had forced him to subscribe, now pressed him
to execute, the treaty of peace. He was impatient to secure an empire
at the expense of a few provinces; and the respectable names of
religion and honor concealed the personal fears and ambition of Jovian.
Notwithstanding the dutiful solicitations of the inhabitants, decency,
as well as prudence, forbade the emperor to lodge in the palace of
Nisibis; but the next morning after his arrival. Bineses, the ambassador
of Persia, entered the place, displayed from the citadel the standard
of the Great King, and proclaimed, in his name, the cruel alternative
of exile or servitude. The principal citizens of Nisibis, who, till that
fatal moment, had confided in the protection of their sovereign, threw
themselves at his feet. They conjured him not to abandon, or, at least,
not to deliver, a faithful colony to the rage of a Barbarian tyrant,
exasperated by the three successive defeats which he had experienced
under the walls of Nisibis. They still possessed arms and courage to
repel the invaders of their country: they requested only the permission
of using them in their own defence; and, as soon as they had asserted
their independence, they should implore the favor of being again
admitted into the ranks of his subjects. Their arguments, their
eloquence, their tears, were ineffectual. Jovian alleged, with some
confusion, the sanctity of oaths; and, as the reluctance with which he
accepted the present of a crown of gold, convinced the citizens of their
hopeless condition, the advocate Sylvanus was provoked to exclaim, "O
emperor! may you thus be crowned by all the cities of your dominions!"
Jovian, who in a few weeks had assumed the habits of a prince, <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a> was
displeased with freedom, and offended with truth: and as he reasonably
supposed, that the discontent of the people might incline them to submit
to the Persian government, he published an edict, under pain of death,
that they should leave the city within the term of three days. Ammianus
has delineated in lively colors the scene of universal despair, which he
seems to have viewed with an eye of compassion. <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a> The martial youth
deserted, with indignant grief, the walls which they had so gloriously
defended: the disconsolate mourner dropped a last tear over the tomb
of a son or husband, which must soon be profaned by the rude hand of a
Barbarian master; and the aged citizen kissed the threshold, and clung
to the doors, of the house where he had passed the cheerful and careless
hours of infancy. The highways were crowded with a trembling multitude:
the distinctions of rank, and sex, and age, were lost in the general
calamity. Every one strove to bear away some fragment from the wreck of
his fortunes; and as they could not command the immediate service of an
adequate number of horses or wagons, they were obliged to leave
behind them the greatest part of their valuable effects. The savage
insensibility of Jovian appears to have aggravated the hardships of
these unhappy fugitives. They were seated, however, in a new-built
quarter of Amida; and that rising city, with the reenforcement of a very
considerable colony, soon recovered its former splendor, and became
the capital of Mesopotamia. <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a> Similar orders were despatched by the
emperor for the evacuation of Singara and the castle of the Moors;
and for the restitution of the five provinces beyond the Tigris. Sapor
enjoyed the glory and the fruits of his victory; and this ignominious
peace has justly been considered as a memorable aera in the decline
and fall of the Roman empire. The predecessors of Jovian had sometimes
relinquished the dominion of distant and unprofitable provinces; but,
since the foundation of the city, the genius of Rome, the god Terminus,
who guarded the boundaries of the republic, had never retired before the
sword of a victorious enemy. <a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a>

After Jovian had performed those engagements which the voice of his
people might have tempted him to violate, he hastened away from the
scene of his disgrace, and proceeded with his whole court to enjoy the
luxury of Antioch. <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a> Without consulting the dictates of religious
zeal, he was prompted, by humanity and gratitude, to bestow the last
honors on the remains of his deceased sovereign: <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a> and Procopius,
who sincerely bewailed the loss of his kinsman, was removed from
the command of the army, under the decent pretence of conducting the
funeral. The corpse of Julian was transported from Nisibis to Tarsus,
in a slow march of fifteen days; and, as it passed through the cities
of the East, was saluted by the hostile factions, with mournful
lamentations and clamorous insults. The Pagans already placed their
beloved hero in the rank of those gods whose worship he had restored;
while the invectives of the Christians pursued the soul of the Apostate
to hell, and his body to the grave. <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a> One party lamented the
approaching ruin of their altars; the other celebrated the marvellous
deliverance of their church. The Christians applauded, in lofty and
ambiguous strains, the stroke of divine vengeance, which had been so
long suspended over the guilty head of Julian. They acknowledge, that
the death of the tyrant, at the instant he expired beyond the Tigris,
was revealed to the saints of Egypt, Syria, and Cappadocia; <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a>
and instead of suffering him to fall by the Persian darts, their
indiscretion ascribed the heroic deed to the obscure hand of some mortal
or immortal champion of the faith. <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a> Such imprudent declarations
were eagerly adopted by the malice, or credulity, of their adversaries;
<a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a> who darkly insinuated, or confidently asserted, that the governors
of the church had instigated and directed the fanaticism of a domestic
assassin. <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a> Above sixteen years after the death of Julian, the
charge was solemnly and vehemently urged, in a public oration, addressed
by Libanius to the emperor Theodosius. His suspicions are unsupported
by fact or argument; and we can only esteem the generous zeal of the
sophist of Antioch for the cold and neglected ashes of his friend. <a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a>

of the emperor by Sapor and his subjects, (Ammian. xxv. 6. Libanius
de ulciscenda Juliani nece, c. xiii. p. 162, 163.) It was urged, as
a decisive proof, that no Persian had appeared to claim the promised
reward, (Liban. Orat. Parent. c. 141, p. 363.) But the flying horseman,
who darted the fatal javelin, might be ignorant of its effect; or he
might be slain in the same action. Ammianus neither feels nor inspires a

It was an ancient custom in the funerals, as well as in the triumphs,
of the Romans, that the voice of praise should be corrected by that of
satire and ridicule; and that, in the midst of the splendid pageants,
which displayed the glory of the living or of the dead, their
imperfections should not be concealed from the eyes of the world. <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a>
This custom was practised in the funeral of Julian. The comedians, who
resented his contempt and aversion for the theatre, exhibited, with
the applause of a Christian audience, the lively and exaggerated
representation of the faults and follies of the deceased emperor. His
various character and singular manners afforded an ample scope for
pleasantry and ridicule. <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a> In the exercise of his uncommon talents,
he often descended below the majesty of his rank. Alexander was
transformed into Diogenes; the philosopher was degraded into a
priest. The purity of his virtue was sullied by excessive vanity; his
superstition disturbed the peace, and endangered the safety, of a mighty
empire; and his irregular sallies were the less entitled to indulgence,
as they appeared to be the laborious efforts of art, or even of
affectation. The remains of Julian were interred at Tarsus in Cilicia;
but his stately tomb, which arose in that city, on the banks of the cold
and limpid Cydnus, <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a> was displeasing to the faithful friends, who
loved and revered the memory of that extraordinary man. The philosopher
expressed a very reasonable wish, that the disciple of Plato might
have reposed amidst the groves of the academy; <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a> while the soldier
exclaimed, in bolder accents, that the ashes of Julian should have
been mingled with those of Caesar, in the field of Mars, and among the
ancient monuments of Roman virtue. <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a> The history of princes does not
very frequently renew the examples of a similar competition.
