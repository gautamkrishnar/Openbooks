<p>
In the apprehension of modern times, Petrarch <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a> is the Italian songster
of Laura and love. In the harmony of his Tuscan rhymes, Italy applauds,
or rather adores, the father of her lyric poetry; and his verse, or
at least his name, is repeated by the enthusiasm, or affectation, of
amorous sensibility. Whatever may be the private taste of a stranger,
his slight and superficial knowledge should humbly acquiesce in the
judgment of a learned nation; yet I may hope or presume, that the
Italians do not compare the tedious uniformity of sonnets and elegies
with the sublime compositions of their epic muse, the original wildness
of Dante, the regular beauties of Tasso, and the boundless variety
of the incomparable Ariosto. The merits of the lover I am still less
qualified to appreciate: nor am I deeply interested in a metaphysical
passion for a nymph so shadowy, that her existence has been questioned;
<a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> for a matron so prolific, <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a> that she was delivered of eleven
legitimate children, <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a> while her amorous swain sighed and sung at the
fountain of Vaucluse. <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a> But in the eyes of Petrarch, and those of his
graver contemporaries, his love was a sin, and Italian verse a frivolous
amusement. His Latin works of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence,
established his serious reputation, which was soon diffused from Avignon
over France and Italy: his friends and disciples were multiplied in
every city; and if the ponderous volume of his writings <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a> be now
abandoned to a long repose, our gratitude must applaud the man, who by
precept and example revived the spirit and study of the Augustan age.
From his earliest youth, Petrarch aspired to the poetic crown. The
academical honors of the three faculties had introduced a royal
degree of master or doctor in the art of poetry; <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a> and the title of
poet-laureate, which custom, rather than vanity, perpetuates in the
English court, <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a> was first invented by the Cæsars of Germany. In the
musical games of antiquity, a prize was bestowed on the victor: <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a> the
belief that Virgil and Horace had been crowned in the Capitol inflamed
the emulation of a Latin bard; <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a> and the laurel <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a> was endeared to
the lover by a verbal resemblance with the name of his mistress. The
value of either object was enhanced by the difficulties of the pursuit;
and if the virtue or prudence of Laura was inexorable, <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a> he enjoyed,
and might boast of enjoying, the nymph of poetry. His vanity was not
of the most delicate kind, since he applauds the success of his own
<i>labors</i>; his name was popular; his friends were active; the open or
secret opposition of envy and prejudice was surmounted by the dexterity
of patient merit. In the thirty-sixth year of his age, he was solicited
to accept the object of his wishes; and on the same day, in the solitude
of Vaucluse, he received a similar and solemn invitation from the senate
of Rome and the university of Paris. The learning of a theological
school, and the ignorance of a lawless city, were alike unqualified to
bestow the ideal though immortal wreath which genius may obtain from
the free applause of the public and of posterity: but the candidate
dismissed this troublesome reflection; and after some moments of
complacency and suspense, preferred the summons of the metropolis of the
world.

[ The Mémoires sur la Vie de François Pétrarque, (Amsterdam,
1764, 1767, 3 vols. in 4to.,) form a copious, original, and entertaining
work, a labor of love, composed from the accurate study of Petrarch
and his contemporaries; but the hero is too often lost in the general
history of the age, and the author too often languishes in the
affectation of politeness and gallantry. In the preface to his first
volume, he enumerates and weighs twenty Italian biographers, who have
professedly treated of the same subject.]

[ Laure de Noves, born about the year 1307, was married
in January 1325, to Hugues de Sade, a noble citizen of Avignon, whose
jealousy was not the effect of love, since he married a second wife
within seven months of her death, which happened the 6th of April, 1348,
precisely one-and-twenty years after Petrarch had seen and loved her.]

[ Corpus crebris partubus exhaustum: from one of these is
issued, in the tenth degree, the abbé de Sade, the fond and grateful
biographer of Petrarch; and this domestic motive most probably suggested
the idea of his work, and urged him to inquire into every circumstance
that could affect the history and character of his grandmother, (see
particularly tom. i. p. 122&mdash;133, notes, p. 7&mdash;58, tom. ii. p. 455&mdash;495

[ Vaucluse, so familiar to our English travellers, is
described from the writings of Petrarch, and the local knowledge of
his biographer, (Mémoires, tom. i. p. 340&mdash;359.) It was, in truth, the
retreat of a hermit; and the moderns are much mistaken, if they place
Laura and a happy lover in the grotto.]

[ From Augustus to Louis, the muse has too often been false
and venal: but I much doubt whether any age or court can produce a
similar establishment of a stipendiary poet, who in every reign, and
at all events, is bound to furnish twice a year a measure of praise
and verse, such as may be sung in the chapel, and, I believe, in the
presence, of the sovereign. I speak the more freely, as the best time
for abolishing this ridiculous custom is while the prince is a man of
virtue and the poet a man of genius.]

[ Isocrates (in Panegyrico, tom. i. p. 116, 117, edit.

instituting and recommending the alwnaV&mdash;kai ta aqla megista&mdash;mh
monon tacouV kai rwmhV, alla kai logwn kai gnwmhV. The example of the
Panathenæa was imitated at Delphi; but the Olympic games were ignorant
of a musical crown, till it was extorted by the vain tyranny of Nero,
(Sueton. in Nerone, c. 23; Philostrat. apud Casaubon ad locum;

the year of Christ 86, (Censorin. de Die Natali, c. 18, p. 100, edit.
Havercamp.) and were not abolished in the ivth century, (Ausonius de
Professoribus Burdegal. V.) If the crown were given to superior merit,
the exclusion of Statius (Capitolia nostræ inficiata lyræ, Sylv. l. iii.
v. 31) may do honor to the games of the Capitol; but the Latin poets who
lived before Domitian were crowned only in the public opinion.]

laurel was not the Capitoline, but the Delphic crown, (Plin. Hist.
Natur p. 39. Hist. Critique de la République des Lettres, tom. i. p.
150&mdash;220.) The victors in the Capitol were crowned with a garland of oak
eaves, (Martial, l. iv. epigram 54.)]

success, to vindicate her immaculate chastity against the censures of
the grave and the sneers of the profane, (tom. ii. notes, p. 76&mdash;82.)]
</p>
<p>
The ceremony of his coronation <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a> was performed in the Capitol, by
his friend and patron the supreme magistrate of the republic. Twelve
patrician youths were arrayed in scarlet; six representatives of the
most illustrious families, in green robes, with garlands of flowers,
accompanied the procession; in the midst of the princes and nobles,
the senator, count of Anguillara, a kinsman of the Colonna, assumed his
throne; and at the voice of a herald Petrarch arose. After discoursing
on a text of Virgil, and thrice repeating his vows for the prosperity of
Rome, he knelt before the throne, and received from the senator a laurel
crown, with a more precious declaration, "This is the reward of merit."
The people shouted, "Long life to the Capitol and the poet!" A sonnet in
praise of Rome was accepted as the effusion of genius and gratitude; and
after the whole procession had visited the Vatican, the profane wreath
was suspended before the shrine of St. Peter. In the act or diploma
<a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a> which was presented to Petrarch, the title and prerogatives of
poet-laureate are revived in the Capitol, after the lapse of thirteen
hundred years; and he receives the perpetual privilege of wearing, at
his choice, a crown of laurel, ivy, or myrtle, of assuming the poetic
habit, and of teaching, disputing, interpreting, and composing, in all
places whatsoever, and on all subjects of literature. The grant was
ratified by the authority of the senate and people; and the character of
citizen was the recompense of his affection for the Roman name. They did
him honor, but they did him justice. In the familiar society of Cicero
and Livy, he had imbibed the ideas of an ancient patriot; and his
ardent fancy kindled every idea to a sentiment, and every sentiment to
a passion. The aspect of the seven hills and their majestic ruins
confirmed these lively impressions; and he loved a country by whose
liberal spirit he had been crowned and adopted. The poverty and
debasement of Rome excited the indignation and pity of her grateful son;
he dissembled the faults of his fellow-citizens; applauded with partial
fondness the last of their heroes and matrons; and in the remembrance of
the past, in the hopes of the future, was pleased to forget the miseries
of the present time. Rome was still the lawful mistress of the world:
the pope and the emperor, the bishop and general, had abdicated their
station by an inglorious retreat to the Rhône and the Danube; but if she
could resume her virtue, the republic might again vindicate her liberty
and dominion. Amidst the indulgence of enthusiasm and eloquence, <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a>
Petrarch, Italy, and Europe, were astonished by a revolution which
realized for a moment his most splendid visions. The rise and fall of
the tribune Rienzi will occupy the following pages: <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a> the subject is
interesting, the materials are rich, and the glance of a patriot bard
<a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> will sometimes vivify the copious, but simple, narrative of the
Florentine, <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> and more especially of the Roman, historian. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a>

request that the reader would open, by chance, either Petrarch, or his
French biographer. The latter has described the poet's first visit to
Rome, (tom. i. p. 323&mdash;335.) But in the place of much idle rhetoric and
morality, Petrarch might have amused the present and future age with an
original account of the city and his coronation.]

[ In his third volume of Italian antiquities, (p. 249&mdash;548,)
Muratori has inserted the Fragmenta Historiæ Romanæ ab Anno 1327 usque
ad Annum 1354, in the original dialect of Rome or Naples in the xivth
century, and a Latin version for the benefit of strangers. It contains
the most particular and authentic life of Cola (Nicholas) di Rienzi;
which had been printed at Bracciano, 1627, in 4to., under the name of
Tomaso Fortifiocca, who is only mentioned in this work as having been
punished by the tribune for forgery. Human nature is scarcely capable
of such sublime or stupid impartiality: but whosoever in the author
of these Fragments, he wrote on the spot and at the time, and paints,
without design or art, the manners of Rome and the character of the
tribune. * Note: Since the publication of my first edition of Gibbon, some new
and very remarkable documents have been brought to light in a life
of Nicolas Rienzi,&mdash;Cola di Rienzo und seine Zeit,&mdash;by Dr. Felix
Papencordt. The most important of these documents are letters from
Rienzi to Charles the Fourth, emperor and king of Bohemia, and to
the archbishop of Praque; they enter into the whole history of his
adventurous career during its first period, and throw a strong light
upon his extraordinary character. These documents were first discovered
and made use of, to a certain extent, by Pelzel, the historian of
Bohemia. The originals have disappeared, but a copy made by Pelzel for
his own use is now in the library of Count Thun at Teschen. There seems
no doubt of their authenticity. Dr. Papencordt has printed the whole
in his Urkunden, with the exception of one long theological paper.&mdash;M.
1845.]
</p>
<p>
In a quarter of the city which was inhabited only by mechanics and Jews,
the marriage of an innkeeper and a washer woman produced the future
deliverer of Rome. <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a> <a href="#note-201" name="noteref-201"><small>201</small></a> From such parents Nicholas Rienzi Gabrini
could inherit neither dignity nor fortune; and the gift of a liberal
education, which they painfully bestowed, was the cause of his glory
and untimely end. The study of history and eloquence, the writings of
Cicero, Seneca, Livy, Cæsar, and Valerius Maximus, elevated above his
equals and contemporaries the genius of the young plebeian: he perused
with indefatigable diligence the manuscripts and marbles of antiquity;
loved to dispense his knowledge in familiar language; and was often
provoked to exclaim, "Where are now these Romans? their virtue, their
justice, their power? why was I not born in those happy times?" <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a> When
the republic addressed to the throne of Avignon an embassy of the three
orders, the spirit and eloquence of Rienzi recommended him to a place
among the thirteen deputies of the commons. The orator had the honor of
haranguing Pope Clement the Sixth, and the satisfaction of conversing
with Petrarch, a congenial mind: but his aspiring hopes were chilled by
disgrace and poverty and the patriot was reduced to a single garment and
the charity of the hospital. <a href="#note-211" name="noteref-211"><small>211</small></a> From this misery he was relieved by the
sense of merit or the smile of favor; and the employment of apostolic
notary afforded him a daily stipend of five gold florins, a more
honorable and extensive connection, and the right of contrasting, both
in words and actions, his own integrity with the vices of the state. The
eloquence of Rienzi was prompt and persuasive: the multitude is always
prone to envy and censure: he was stimulated by the loss of a brother
and the impunity of the assassins; nor was it possible to excuse or
exaggerate the public calamities. The blessings of peace and justice,
for which civil society has been instituted, were banished from Rome:
the jealous citizens, who might have endured every personal or pecuniary
injury, were most deeply wounded in the dishonor of their wives and
daughters: <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a> they were equally oppressed by the arrogance of the
nobles and the corruption of the magistrates; <a href="#note-221" name="noteref-221"><small>221</small></a> and the abuse of arms
or of laws was the only circumstance that distinguished the lions from
the dogs and serpents of the Capitol. These allegorical emblems were
variously repeated in the pictures which Rienzi exhibited in the streets
and churches; and while the spectators gazed with curious wonder, the
bold and ready orator unfolded the meaning, applied the satire, inflamed
their passions, and announced a distant hope of comfort and deliverance.
The privileges of Rome, her eternal sovereignty over her princes and
provinces, was the theme of his public and private discourse; and a
monument of servitude became in his hands a title and incentive
of liberty. The decree of the senate, which granted the most ample
prerogatives to the emperor Vespasian, had been inscribed on a copper
plate still extant in the choir of the church of St. John Lateran. <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a> A
numerous assembly of nobles and plebeians was invited to this political
lecture, and a convenient theatre was erected for their reception. The
notary appeared in a magnificent and mysterious habit, explained
the inscription by a version and commentary, <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a> and descanted with
eloquence and zeal on the ancient glories of the senate and people, from
whom all legal authority was derived. The supine ignorance of the
nobles was incapable of discerning the serious tendency of such
representations: they might sometimes chastise with words and blows the
plebeian reformer; but he was often suffered in the Colonna palace
to amuse the company with his threats and predictions; and the modern
Brutus <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a> was concealed under the mask of folly and the character of
a buffoon. While they indulged their contempt, the restoration of the
<i>good estate</i>, his favorite expression, was entertained among the people
as a desirable, a possible, and at length as an approaching, event;
and while all had the disposition to applaud, some had the courage to
assist, their promised deliverer.

<p>
A prophecy, or rather a summons, affixed on the church door of St.
George, was the first public evidence of his designs; a nocturnal
assembly of a hundred citizens on Mount Aventine, the first step to
their execution. After an oath of secrecy and aid, he represented to the
conspirators the importance and facility of their enterprise; that the
nobles, without union or resources, were strong only in the fear nobles,
of their imaginary strength; that all power, as well as right, was in
the hands of the people; that the revenues of the apostolical chamber
might relieve the public distress; and that the pope himself would
approve their victory over the common enemies of government and freedom.
After securing a faithful band to protect his first declaration, he
proclaimed through the city, by sound of trumpet, that on the evening of
the following day, all persons should assemble without arms before the
church of St. Angelo, to provide for the reestablishment of the good
estate. The whole night was employed in the celebration of thirty
masses of the Holy Ghost; and in the morning, Rienzi, bareheaded, but
in complete armor, issued from the church, encompassed by the hundred
conspirators. The pope's vicar, the simple bishop of Orvieto, who had
been persuaded to sustain a part in this singular ceremony, marched
on his right hand; and three great standards were borne aloft as the
emblems of their design. In the first, the banner of <i>liberty</i>, Rome was
seated on two lions, with a palm in one hand and a globe in the other;
St. Paul, with a drawn sword, was delineated in the banner of <i>justice</i>;
and in the third, St. Peter held the keys of <i>concord</i> and <i>peace</i>.
Rienzi was encouraged by the presence and applause of an innumerable
crowd, who understood little, and hoped much; and the procession slowly
rolled forwards from the castle of St. Angelo to the Capitol. His
triumph was disturbed by some secret emotions which he labored to
suppress: he ascended without opposition, and with seeming confidence,
the citadel of the republic; harangued the people from the balcony;
and received the most flattering confirmation of his acts and laws.
The nobles, as if destitute of arms and counsels, beheld in silent
consternation this strange revolution; and the moment had been prudently
chosen, when the most formidable, Stephen Colonna, was absent from the
city. On the first rumor, he returned to his palace, affected to despise
this plebeian tumult, and declared to the messenger of Rienzi, that at
his leisure he would cast the madman from the windows of the Capitol.
The great bell instantly rang an alarm, and so rapid was the tide, so
urgent was the danger, that Colonna escaped with precipitation to the
suburb of St. Laurence: from thence, after a moment's refreshment, he
continued the same speedy career till he reached in safety his castle
of Palestrina; lamenting his own imprudence, which had not trampled the
spark of this mighty conflagration. A general and peremptory order was
issued from the Capitol to all the nobles, that they should peaceably
retire to their estates: they obeyed; and their departure secured the
tranquillity of the free and obedient citizens of Rome.
</p>
<p>
But such voluntary obedience evaporates with the first transports of
zeal; and Rienzi felt the importance of justifying his usurpation by
a regular form and a legal title. At his own choice, the Roman people
would have displayed their attachment and authority, by lavishing on his
head the names of senator or consul, of king or emperor: he preferred
the ancient and modest appellation of tribune; <a href="#note-251" name="noteref-251"><small>251</small></a> the protection of the
commons was the essence of that sacred office; and they were ignorant,
that it had never been invested with any share in the legislative
or executive powers of the republic. In this character, and with the
consent of the Roman, the tribune enacted the most salutary laws for the
restoration and maintenance of the good estate. By the first he fulfils
the wish of honesty and inexperience, that no civil suit should be
protracted beyond the term of fifteen days. The danger of frequent
perjury might justify the pronouncing against a false accuser the same
penalty which his evidence would have inflicted: the disorders of the
times might compel the legislator to punish every homicide with death,
and every injury with equal retaliation. But the execution of justice
was hopeless till he had previously abolished the tyranny of the nobles.
It was formally provided, that none, except the supreme magistrate,
should possess or command the gates, bridges, or towers of the state;
that no private garrisons should be introduced into the towns or castles
of the Roman territory; that none should bear arms, or presume to
fortify their houses in the city or country; that the barons should
be responsible for the safety of the highways, and the free passage of
provisions; and that the protection of malefactors and robbers should be
expiated by a fine of a thousand marks of silver. But these regulations
would have been impotent and nugatory, had not the licentious nobles
been awed by the sword of the civil power. A sudden alarm from the bell
of the Capitol could still summon to the standard above twenty thousand
volunteers: the support of the tribune and the laws required a more
regular and permanent force. In each harbor of the coast a vessel was
stationed for the assurance of commerce; a standing militia of three
hundred and sixty horse and thirteen hundred foot was levied, clothed,
and paid in the thirteen quarters of the city: and the spirit of a
commonwealth may be traced in the grateful allowance of one hundred
florins, or pounds, to the heirs of every soldier who lost his life in
the service of his country. For the maintenance of the public defence,
for the establishment of granaries, for the relief of widows, orphans,
and indigent convents, Rienzi applied, without fear of sacrilege, the
revenues of the apostolic chamber: the three branches of hearth-money,
the salt-duty, and the customs, were each of the annual produce of one
hundred thousand florins; <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a> and scandalous were the abuses, if in
four or five months the amount of the salt-duty could be trebled by his
judicious economy. After thus restoring the forces and finances of
the republic, the tribune recalled the nobles from their solitary
independence; required their personal appearance in the Capitol; and
imposed an oath of allegiance to the new government, and of submission
to the laws of the good estate. Apprehensive for their safety, but still
more apprehensive of the danger of a refusal, the princes and barons
returned to their houses at Rome in the garb of simple and peaceful
citizens: the Colonna and Ursini, the Savelli and Frangipani, were
confounded before the tribunal of a plebeian, of the vile buffoon whom
they had so often derided, and their disgrace was aggravated by the
indignation which they vainly struggled to disguise. The same oath was
successively pronounced by the several orders of society, the clergy and
gentlemen, the judges and notaries, the merchants and artisans, and the
gradual descent was marked by the increase of sincerity and zeal. They
swore to live and die with the republic and the church, whose interest
was artfully united by the nominal association of the bishop of Orvieto,
the pope's vicar, to the office of tribune. It was the boast of Rienzi,
that he had delivered the throne and patrimony of St. Peter from a
rebellious aristocracy; and Clement the Sixth, who rejoiced in its
fall, affected to believe the professions, to applaud the merits, and to
confirm the title, of his trusty servant. The speech, perhaps the mind,
of the tribune, was inspired with a lively regard for the purity of the
faith: he insinuated his claim to a supernatural mission from the Holy
Ghost; enforced by a heavy forfeiture the annual duty of confession
and communion; and strictly guarded the spiritual as well as temporal
welfare of his faithful people. <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a>

<h2>
    Chapter LXX: Final Settlement Of The Ecclesiastical State.&mdash;Part II.
</h2>
<p>
Never perhaps has the energy and effect of a single mind been more
remarkably felt than in the sudden, though transient, reformation
of Rome by the tribune Rienzi. A den of robbers was converted to the
discipline of a camp or convent: patient to hear, swift to redress,
inexorable to punish, his tribunal was always accessible to the poor and
stranger; nor could birth, or dignity, or the immunities of the church,
protect the offender or his accomplices. The privileged houses, the
private sanctuaries in Rome, on which no officer of justice would
presume to trespass, were abolished; and he applied the timber and iron
of their barricades in the fortifications of the Capitol. The venerable
father of the Colonna was exposed in his own palace to the double shame
of being desirous, and of being unable, to protect a criminal. A mule,
with a jar of oil, had been stolen near Capranica; and the lord of the
Ursini family was condemned to restore the damage, and to discharge
a fine of four hundred florins for his negligence in guarding the
highways. Nor were the persons of the barons more inviolate than their
lands or houses; and, either from accident or design, the same impartial
rigor was exercised against the heads of the adverse factions. Peter
Agapet Colonna, who had himself been senator of Rome, was arrested in
the street for injury or debt; and justice was appeased by the tardy
execution of Martin Ursini, who, among his various acts of violence and
rapine, had pillaged a shipwrecked vessel at the mouth of the Tyber. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a>
His name, the purple of two cardinals, his uncles, a recent marriage,
and a mortal disease were disregarded by the inflexible tribune, who had
chosen his victim. The public officers dragged him from his palace
and nuptial bed: his trial was short and satisfactory: the bell of the
Capitol convened the people: stripped of his mantle, on his knees, with
his hands bound behind his back, he heard the sentence of death; and
after a brief confession, Ursini was led away to the gallows. After such
an example, none who were conscious of guilt could hope for impunity,
and the flight of the wicked, the licentious, and the idle, soon
purified the city and territory of Rome. In this time (says the
historian,) the woods began to rejoice that they were no longer infested
with robbers; the oxen began to plough; the pilgrims visited the
sanctuaries; the roads and inns were replenished with travellers; trade,
plenty, and good faith, were restored in the markets; and a purse of
gold might be exposed without danger in the midst of the highway. As
soon as the life and property of the subject are secure, the labors and
rewards of industry spontaneously revive: Rome was still the metropolis
of the Christian world; and the fame and fortunes of the tribune were
diffused in every country by the strangers who had enjoyed the blessings
of his government.

shipwreck, we learn some circumstances of the trade and navigation of
the age. 1. The ship was built and freighted at Naples for the ports of
Marseilles and Avignon. 2. The sailors were of Naples and the Isle of
naria less skilful than those of Sicily and Genoa. 3. The navigation
from Marseilles was a coasting voyage to the mouth of the Tyber, where
they took shelter in a storm; but, instead of finding the current,
unfortunately ran on a shoal: the vessel was stranded, the mariners
escaped. 4. The cargo, which was pillaged, consisted of the revenue of
Provence for the royal treasury, many bags of pepper and cinnamon, and
bales of French cloth, to the value of 20,000 florins; a rich prize.]
</p>
<p>
The deliverance of his country inspired Rienzi with a vast, and perhaps
visionary, idea of uniting Italy in a great federative republic, of
which Rome should be the ancient and lawful head, and the free cities
and princes the members and associates. His pen was not less eloquent
than his tongue; and his numerous epistles were delivered to swift
and trusty messengers. On foot, with a white wand in their hand, they
traversed the forests and mountains; enjoyed, in the most hostile
states, the sacred security of ambassadors; and reported, in the style
of flattery or truth, that the highways along their passage were lined
with kneeling multitudes, who implored Heaven for the success of their
undertaking. Could passion have listened to reason; could private
interest have yielded to the public welfare; the supreme tribunal
and confederate union of the Italian republic might have healed their
intestine discord, and closed the Alps against the Barbarians of the
North. But the propitious season had elapsed; and if Venice, Florence,
Sienna, Perugia, and many inferior cities offered their lives and
fortunes to the good estate, the tyrants of Lombardy and Tuscany must
despise, or hate, the plebeian author of a free constitution. From them,
however, and from every part of Italy, the tribune received the most
friendly and respectful answers: they were followed by the ambassadors
of the princes and republics; and in this foreign conflux, on all the
occasions of pleasure or business, the low born notary could assume
the familiar or majestic courtesy of a sovereign. <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a> The most glorious
circumstance of his reign was an appeal to his justice from Lewis, king
of Hungary, who complained, that his brother and her husband had been
perfidiously strangled by Jane, queen of Naples: <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a> her guilt or
innocence was pleaded in a solemn trial at Rome; but after hearing the
advocates, <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a> the tribune adjourned this weighty and invidious cause,
which was soon determined by the sword of the Hungarian. Beyond the
Alps, more especially at Avignon, the revolution was the theme of
curiosity, wonder, and applause. <a href="#note-311" name="noteref-311"><small>311</small></a> Petrarch had been the private
friend, perhaps the secret counsellor, of Rienzi: his writings breathe
the most ardent spirit of patriotism and joy; and all respect for the
pope, all gratitude for the Colonna, was lost in the superior duties
of a Roman citizen. The poet-laureate of the Capitol maintains the act,
applauds the hero, and mingles with some apprehension and advice, the
most lofty hopes of the permanent and rising greatness of the republic.

describes the effect of his elevation on Italy and on the world: "Did
I not restore real peace among the cities which were distracted by
factions? did I not cause all the citizens, exiled by party violence,
with their wretched wives and children, to be readmitted? had I not
begun to extinguish the factious names (scismatica nomina) of Guelf and
Ghibelline, for which countless thousands had perished body and soul,
under the eyes of their pastors, by the reduction of the city of Rome
and all Italy into one amicable, peaceful, holy, and united confederacy?
the consecrated standards and banners having been by me collected and
blended together, and, in witness to our holy association and perfect
union, offered up in the presence of the ambassadors of all the cities
of Italy, on the day of the assumption of our Blessed Lady." p. xlvii.

all the sovereigns of Apulia, the barons and counts, and almost all the
people of Italy. I was honored by solemn embassies and letters by the
emperor of Constantinople and the king of England. The queen of Naples
submitted herself and her kingdom to the protection of the tribune. The
king of Hungary, by two solemn embassies, brought his cause against his
queen and his nobles before my tribunal; and I venture to say further,
that the fame of the tribune alarmed the soldan of Babylon. When the
Christian pilgrims to the sepulchre of our Lord related to the Christian
and Jewish inhabitants of Jerusalem all the yet unheard-of and wonderful
circumstances of the reformation in Rome, both Jews and Christians
celebrated the event with unusual festivities. When the soldan inquired
the cause of these rejoicings, and received this intelligence about
Rome, he ordered all the havens and cities on the coast to be fortified,
and put in a state of defence," p. xxxv.&mdash;M. 1845.]

While Petrarch indulged these prophetic visions, the Roman hero was fast
declining from the meridian of fame and power; and the people, who
had gazed with astonishment on the ascending meteor, began to mark the
irregularity of its course, and the vicissitudes of light and obscurity.
More eloquent than judicious, more enterprising than resolute, the
faculties of Rienzi were not balanced by cool and commanding reason:
he magnified in a tenfold proportion the objects of hope and fear; and
prudence, which could not have erected, did not presume to fortify,
his throne. In the blaze of prosperity, his virtues were insensibly
tinctured with the adjacent vices; justice with cruelly, cruelty,
liberality with profusion, and the desire of fame with puerile and
ostentatious vanity. <a href="#note-321" name="noteref-321"><small>321</small></a> He might have learned, that the ancient
tribunes, so strong and sacred in the public opinion, were not
distinguished in style, habit, or appearance, from an ordinary plebeian;
<a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a> and that as often as they visited the city on foot, a single viator,
or beadle, attended the exercise of their office. The Gracchi would have
frowned or smiled, could they have read the sonorous titles and epithets
of their successor, "Nicholas, severe and merciful; deliverer of Rome;
defender of Italy; <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a> friend of mankind, and of liberty, peace, and
justice; tribune august:" his theatrical pageants had prepared the
revolution; but Rienzi abused, in luxury and pride, the political maxim
of speaking to the eyes, as well as the understanding, of the multitude.
From nature he had received the gift of a handsome person, <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a> till
it was swelled and disfigured by intemperance: and his propensity to
laughter was corrected in the magistrate by the affectation of gravity
and sternness. He was clothed, at least on public occasions, in a
party-colored robe of velvet or satin, lined with fur, and embroidered
with gold: the rod of justice, which he carried in his hand, was a
sceptre of polished steel, crowned with a globe and cross of gold, and
enclosing a small fragment of the true and holy wood. In his civil and
religious processions through the city, he rode on a white steed, the
symbol of royalty: the great banner of the republic, a sun with a circle
of stars, a dove with an olive branch, was displayed over his head; a
shower of gold and silver was scattered among the populace, fifty guards
with halberds encompassed his person; a troop of horse preceded his
march; and their tymbals and trumpets were of massy silver.

tribune was not less odious to the nobles, whom he adopted, than to

attended his wife; and the ambassadors of Italy might loudly applaud or

legend) had been healed of his leprosy by Pope Sylvester. <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a> With
equal presumption the tribune watched or reposed within the consecrated
precincts of the baptistery; and the failure of his state-bed was
interpreted as an omen of his approaching downfall. At the hour of
worship, he showed himself to the returning crowds in a majestic
attitude, with a robe of purple, his sword, and gilt spurs; but the holy
rites were soon interrupted by his levity and insolence. Rising from his
throne, and advancing towards the congregation, he proclaimed in a
loud voice: "We summon to our tribunal Pope Clement: and command him
to reside in his diocese of Rome: we also summon the sacred college of
cardinals. <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> We again summon the two pretenders, Charles of Bohemia
and Lewis of Bavaria, who style themselves emperors: we likewise summon
all the electors of Germany, to inform us on what pretence they have
usurped the inalienable right of the Roman people, the ancient and
lawful sovereigns of the empire." <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a> Unsheathing his maiden sword,
he thrice brandished it to the three parts of the world, and thrice
repeated the extravagant declaration, "And this too is mine!" The pope's
vicar, the bishop of Orvieto, attempted to check this career of folly;
but his feeble protest was silenced by martial music; and instead of
withdrawing from the assembly, he consented to dine with his brother
tribune, at a table which had hitherto been reserved for the supreme
pontiff. A banquet, such as the Cæsars had given, was prepared for the
Romans. The apartments, porticos, and courts of the Lateran were spread
with innumerable tables for either sex, and every condition; a stream
of wine flowed from the nostrils of Constantine's brazen horse; no
complaint, except of the scarcity of water, could be heard; and the
licentiousness of the multitude was curbed by discipline and fear. A
subsequent day was appointed for the coronation of Rienzi; <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a> seven
crowns of different leaves or metals were successively placed on his
head by the most eminent of the Roman clergy; they represented the seven
gifts of the Holy Ghost; and he still professed to imitate the example
of the ancient tribunes. <a href="#note-401" name="noteref-401"><small>401</small></a> These extraordinary spectacles might deceive
or flatter the people; and their own vanity was gratified in the vanity
of their leader. But in his private life he soon deviated from the
strict rule of frugality and abstinence; and the plebeians, who were
awed by the splendor of the nobles, were provoked by the luxury of their
equal. His wife, his son, his uncle, (a barber in name and profession,)
exposed the contrast of vulgar manners and princely expense; and without
acquiring the majesty, Rienzi degenerated into the vices, of a king.

between himself and our Lord; and the striking circumstance took place
which he relates in his letter to the archbishop of Prague. In the midst
of all the wild and joyous exultation of the people, one of his most
zealous supporters, a monk, who was in high repute for his sanctity,
stood apart in a corner of the church and wept bitterly! A domestic
chaplain of Rienzi's inquired the cause of his grief. "Now," replied
the man of God, "is thy master cast down from heaven&mdash;never saw I man so

for his labors, and in his wanton speech liken himself to the Creator?
Tell thy master that he can only atone for this offence by tears of

<p>
A simple citizen describes with pity, or perhaps with pleasure, the
humiliation of the barons of Rome. "Bareheaded, their hands crossed
on their breast, they stood with downcast looks in the presence of the
tribune; and they trembled, good God, how they trembled!" <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a> As long
as the yoke of Rienzi was that of justice and their country, their
conscience forced them to esteem the man, whom pride and interest
provoked them to hate: his extravagant conduct soon fortified their
hatred by contempt; and they conceived the hope of subverting a power
which was no longer so deeply rooted in the public confidence. The old
animosity of the Colonna and Ursini was suspended for a moment by
their common disgrace: they associated their wishes, and perhaps their
designs; an assassin was seized and tortured; he accused the nobles;
and as soon as Rienzi deserved the fate, he adopted the suspicions
and maxims, of a tyrant. On the same day, under various pretences,
he invited to the Capitol his principal enemies, among whom were five
members of the Ursini and three of the Colonna name. But instead of a
council or a banquet, they found themselves prisoners under the sword of
despotism or justice; and the consciousness of innocence or guilt might
inspire them with equal apprehensions of danger. At the sound of the
great bell the people assembled; they were arraigned for a conspiracy
against the tribune's life; and though some might sympathize in their
distress, not a hand, nor a voice, was raised to rescue the first of the
nobility from their impending doom. Their apparent boldness was prompted
by despair; they passed in separate chambers a sleepless and painful
night; and the venerable hero, Stephen Colonna, striking against the
door of his prison, repeatedly urged his guards to deliver him by
a speedy death from such ignominious servitude. In the morning they
understood their sentence from the visit of a confessor and the tolling
of the bell. The great hall of the Capitol had been decorated for the
bloody scene with red and white hangings: the countenance of the tribune
was dark and severe; the swords of the executioners were unsheathed;
and the barons were interrupted in their dying speeches by the sound of
trumpets. But in this decisive moment, Rienzi was not less anxious or
apprehensive than his captives: he dreaded the splendor of their names,
their surviving kinsmen, the inconstancy of the people the reproaches
of the world, and, after rashly offering a mortal injury, he vainly
presumed that, if he could forgive, he might himself be forgiven. His
elaborate oration was that of a Christian and a suppliant; and, as the
humble minister of the commons, he entreated his masters to pardon these
noble criminals, for whose repentance and future service he pledged
his faith and authority. "If you are spared," said the tribune, "by the
mercy of the Romans, will you not promise to support the good estate
with your lives and fortunes?" Astonished by this marvellous clemency,
the barons bowed their heads; and while they devoutly repeated the oath
of allegiance, might whisper a secret, and more sincere, assurance
of revenge. A priest, in the name of the people, pronounced their
absolution: they received the communion with the tribune, assisted at
the banquet, followed the procession; and, after every spiritual and
temporal sign of reconciliation, were dismissed in safety to their
respective homes, with the new honors and titles of generals, consuls,
and patricians. <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a>

During some weeks they were checked by the memory of their danger,
rather than of their deliverance, till the most powerful of the Ursini,
escaping with the Colonna from the city, erected at Marino the standard
of rebellion. The fortifications of the castle were instantly restored;
the vassals attended their lord; the outlaws armed against the
magistrate; the flocks and herds, the harvests and vineyards, from
Marino to the gates of Rome, were swept away or destroyed; and the
people arraigned Rienzi as the author of the calamities which his
government had taught them to forget. In the camp, Rienzi appeared to
less advantage than in the rostrum; and he neglected the progress of
the rebel barons till their numbers were strong, and their castles
impregnable. From the pages of Livy he had not imbibed the art, or even
the courage, of a general: an army of twenty thousand Romans returned
without honor or effect from the attack of Marino; and his vengeance was
amused by painting his enemies, their heads downwards, and drowning two
dogs (at least they should have been bears) as the representatives of
the Ursini. The belief of his incapacity encouraged their operations:
they were invited by their secret adherents; and the barons attempted,
with four thousand foot, and sixteen hundred horse, to enter Rome
by force or surprise. The city was prepared for their reception;
the alarm-bell rung all night; the gates were strictly guarded, or
insolently open; and after some hesitation they sounded a retreat. The
two first divisions had passed along the walls, but the prospect of a
free entrance tempted the headstrong valor of the nobles in the rear;
and after a successful skirmish, they were overthrown and massacred
without quarter by the crowds of the Roman people. Stephen Colonna the
younger, the noble spirit to whom Petrarch ascribed the restoration of
Italy, was preceded or accompanied in death by his son John, a gallant
youth, by his brother Peter, who might regret the ease and honors of
the church, by a nephew of legitimate birth, and by two bastards of
the Colonna race; and the number of seven, the seven crowns, as Rienzi
styled them, of the Holy Ghost, was completed by the agony of the
deplorable parent, and the veteran chief, who had survived the hope and
fortune of his house. The vision and prophecies of St. Martin and Pope
Boniface had been used by the tribune to animate his troops: <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a> he
displayed, at least in the pursuit, the spirit of a hero; but he forgot
the maxims of the ancient Romans, who abhorred the triumphs of civil
war. The conqueror ascended the Capitol; deposited his crown and sceptre
on the altar; and boasted, with some truth, that he had cut off an ear,
which neither pope nor emperor had been able to amputate. <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a> His base
and implacable revenge denied the honors of burial; and the bodies of
the Colonna, which he threatened to expose with those of the vilest
malefactors, were secretly interred by the holy virgins of their name
and family. <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a> The people sympathized in their grief, repented of their
own fury, and detested the indecent joy of Rienzi, who visited the spot
where these illustrious victims had fallen. It was on that fatal spot
that he conferred on his son the honor of knighthood: and the ceremony
was accomplished by a slight blow from each of the horsemen of the
guard, and by a ridiculous and inhuman ablution from a pool of water,
which was yet polluted with patrician blood. <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a>

A short delay would have saved the Colonna, the delay of a single month,
which elapsed between the triumph and the exile of Rienzi. In the pride
of victory, he forfeited what yet remained of his civil virtues, without
acquiring the fame of military prowess. A free and vigorous opposition
was formed in the city; and when the tribune proposed in the public
council <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a> to impose a new tax, and to regulate the government of
Perugia, thirty-nine members voted against his measures; repelled the
injurious charge of treachery and corruption; and urged him to prove, by
their forcible exclusion, that if the populace adhered to his cause, it
was already disclaimed by the most respectable citizens. The pope and
the sacred college had never been dazzled by his specious professions;
they were justly offended by the insolence of his conduct; a cardinal
legate was sent to Italy, and after some fruitless treaty, and two
personal interviews, he fulminated a bull of excommunication, in which
the tribune is degraded from his office, and branded with the guilt of
rebellion, sacrilege, and heresy. <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> The surviving barons of Rome were
now humbled to a sense of allegiance; their interest and revenge engaged
them in the service of the church; but as the fate of the Colonna was
before their eyes, they abandoned to a private adventurer the peril
and glory of the revolution. John Pepin, count of Minorbino, <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> in the
kingdom of Naples, had been condemned for his crimes, or his riches,
to perpetual imprisonment; and Petrarch, by soliciting his release,
indirectly contributed to the ruin of his friend. At the head of one
hundred and fifty soldiers, the count of Minorbino introduced himself
into Rome; barricaded the quarter of the Colonna: and found the
enterprise as easy as it had seemed impossible. From the first alarm,
the bell of the Capitol incessantly tolled; but, instead of repairing
to the well-known sound, the people were silent and inactive; and the
pusillanimous Rienzi, deploring their ingratitude with sighs and tears,
abdicated the government and palace of the republic.

<p>
Without drawing his sword, count Pepin restored the aristocracy and the
church; three senators were chosen, and the legate, assuming the first
rank, accepted his two colleagues from the rival families of Colonna and
Ursini. The acts of the tribune were abolished, his head was proscribed;
yet such was the terror of his name, that the barons hesitated three
days before they would trust themselves in the city, and Rienzi was
left above a month in the castle of St. Angelo, from whence he peaceably
withdrew, after laboring, without effect, to revive the affection and
courage of the Romans. The vision of freedom and empire had vanished:
their fallen spirit would have acquiesced in servitude, had it been
smoothed by tranquillity and order; and it was scarcely observed, that
the new senators derived their authority from the Apostolic See; that
four cardinals were appointed to reform, with dictatorial power, the
state of the republic. Rome was again agitated by the bloody feuds of
the barons, who detested each other, and despised the commons: their
hostile fortresses, both in town and country, again rose, and were again
demolished: and the peaceful citizens, a flock of sheep, were devoured,
says the Florentine historian, by these rapacious wolves. But when
their pride and avarice had exhausted the patience of the Romans, a
confraternity of the Virgin Mary protected or avenged the republic: the
bell of the Capitol was again tolled, the nobles in arms trembled in
the presence of an unarmed multitude; and of the two senators, Colonna
escaped from the window of the palace, and Ursini was stoned at the foot
of the altar. The dangerous office of tribune was successively occupied
by two plebeians, Cerroni and Baroncelli. The mildness of Cerroni was
unequal to the times; and after a faint struggle, he retired with a fair
reputation and a decent fortune to the comforts of rural life. Devoid of
eloquence or genius, Baroncelli was distinguished by a resolute spirit:
he spoke the language of a patriot, and trod in the footsteps of
tyrants; his suspicion was a sentence of death, and his own death was
the reward of his cruelties. Amidst the public misfortunes, the faults
of Rienzi were forgotten; and the Romans sighed for the peace and
prosperity of their good estate. <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a>

After an exile of seven years, the first deliverer was again restored to
his country. In the disguise of a monk or a pilgrim, he escaped from the
castle of St. Angelo, implored the friendship of the king of Hungary at
Naples, tempted the ambition of every bold adventurer, mingled at Rome
with the pilgrims of the jubilee, lay concealed among the hermits of
the Apennine, and wandered through the cities of Italy, Germany, and
Bohemia. His person was invisible, his name was yet formidable; and
the anxiety of the court of Avignon supposes, and even magnifies,
his personal merit. The emperor Charles the Fourth gave audience to a
stranger, who frankly revealed himself as the tribune of the republic;
and astonished an assembly of ambassadors and princes, by the eloquence
of a patriot and the visions of a prophet, the downfall of tyranny and
the kingdom of the Holy Ghost. <a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a> Whatever had been his hopes, Rienzi
found himself a captive; but he supported a character of independence
and dignity, and obeyed, as his own choice, the irresistible summons of
the supreme pontiff. The zeal of Petrarch, which had been cooled by the
unworthy conduct, was rekindled by the sufferings and the presence, of
his friend; and he boldly complains of the times, in which the savior of
Rome was delivered by her emperor into the hands of her bishop. Rienzi
was transported slowly, but in safe custody, from Prague to Avignon: his
entrance into the city was that of a malefactor; in his prison he was
chained by the leg; and four cardinals were named to inquire into the
crimes of heresy and rebellion. But his trial and condemnation would
have involved some questions, which it was more prudent to leave under
the veil of mystery: the temporal supremacy of the popes; the duty of
residence; the civil and ecclesiastical privileges of the clergy and
people of Rome. The reigning pontiff well deserved the appellation
of <i>Clement</i>: the strange vicissitudes and magnanimous spirit of the
captive excited his pity and esteem; and Petrarch believes that he
respected in the hero the name and sacred character of a poet. <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a>
Rienzi was indulged with an easy confinement and the use of books; and
in the assiduous study of Livy and the Bible, he sought the cause and
the consolation of his misfortunes.

tribune taught, that Christ was succeeded by the Holy Ghost, that the
tyranny of the pope would be abolished, he might have been convicted of
heresy and treason, without offending the Roman people. * Note: 
So far from having magnified these visions, Pollistore is more
than confirmed by the documents published by Papencordt. The adoption of
all the wild doctrines of the Fratricelli, the Spirituals, in which,
for the time at least, Rienzi appears to have been in earnest; his
magnificent offers to the emperor, and the whole history of his life,
from his first escape from Rome to his imprisonment at Avignon, are

<p>
The succeeding pontificate of Innocent the Sixth opened a new prospect
of his deliverance and restoration; and the court of Avignon was
persuaded, that the successful rebel could alone appease and reform the
anarchy of the metropolis. After a solemn profession of fidelity, the
Roman tribune was sent into Italy, with the title of senator; but the
death of Baroncelli appeared to supersede the use of his mission; and
the legate, Cardinal Albornoz, <a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a> a consummate statesman, allowed him
with reluctance, and without aid, to undertake the perilous experiment.
His first reception was equal to his wishes: the day of his entrance was
a public festival; and his eloquence and authority revived the laws of
the good estate. But this momentary sunshine was soon clouded by his own
vices and those of the people: in the Capitol, he might often regret
the prison of Avignon; and after a second administration of four months,
Rienzi was massacred in a tumult which had been fomented by the Roman
barons. In the society of the Germans and Bohemians, he is said to have
contracted the habits of intemperance and cruelty: adversity had chilled
his enthusiasm, without fortifying his reason or virtue; and that
youthful hope, that lively assurance, which is the pledge of success,
was now succeeded by the cold impotence of distrust and despair. The
tribune had reigned with absolute dominion, by the choice, and in the
hearts, of the Romans: the senator was the servile minister of a foreign
court; and while he was suspected by the people, he was abandoned by the
prince. The legate Albornoz, who seemed desirous of his ruin, inflexibly
refused all supplies of men and money; a faithful subject could no
longer presume to touch the revenues of the apostolical chamber; and
the first idea of a tax was the signal of clamor and sedition. Even his
justice was tainted with the guilt or reproach of selfish cruelty: the
most virtuous citizen of Rome was sacrificed to his jealousy; and in the
execution of a public robber, from whose purse he had been assisted, the
magistrate too much forgot, or too much remembered, the obligations of
the debtor. <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a> A civil war exhausted his treasures, and the patience
of the city: the Colonna maintained their hostile station at Palestrina;
and his mercenaries soon despised a leader whose ignorance and fear
were envious of all subordinate merit. In the death, as in the life, of
Rienzi, the hero and the coward were strangely mingled. When the Capitol
was invested by a furious multitude, when he was basely deserted by his
civil and military servants, the intrepid senator, waving the banner of
liberty, presented himself on the balcony, addressed his eloquence to
the various passions of the Romans, and labored to persuade them, that
in the same cause himself and the republic must either stand or fall.
His oration was interrupted by a volley of imprecations and stones; and
after an arrow had transpierced his hand, he sunk into abject despair,
and fled weeping to the inner chambers, from whence he was let down by a
sheet before the windows of the prison. Destitute of aid or hope, he was
besieged till the evening: the doors of the Capitol were destroyed with
axes and fire; and while the senator attempted to escape in a plebeian
habit, he was discovered and dragged to the platform of the palace, the
fatal scene of his judgments and executions. A whole hour, without voice
or motion, he stood amidst the multitude half naked and half dead:
their rage was hushed into curiosity and wonder: the last feelings of
reverence and compassion yet struggled in his favor; and they might have
prevailed, if a bold assassin had not plunged a dagger in his breast.
He fell senseless with the first stroke: the impotent revenge of
his enemies inflicted a thousand wounds: and the senator's body was
abandoned to the dogs, to the Jews, and to the flames. Posterity will
compare the virtues and failings of this extraordinary man; but in a
long period of anarchy and servitude, the name of Rienzi has often been
celebrated as the deliverer of his country, and the last of the Roman
patriots. <a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a>

nor his enemy, (l. iii. c. 12&mdash;25.) Petrarch, who loved the <i>tribune</i>,
was indifferent to the fate of the <i>senator</i>.]
</p>
<p>
The first and most generous wish of Petrarch was the restoration of a
free republic; but after the exile and death of his plebeian hero,
he turned his eyes from the tribune, to the king, of the Romans. The
Capitol was yet stained with the blood of Rienzi, when Charles the
Fourth descended from the Alps to obtain the Italian and Imperial
crowns. In his passage through Milan he received the visit, and repaid
the flattery, of the poet-laureate; accepted a medal of Augustus; and
promised, without a smile, to imitate the founder of the Roman monarchy.
A false application of the name and maxims of antiquity was the source
of the hopes and disappointments of Petrarch; yet he could not overlook
the difference of times and characters; the immeasurable distance
between the first Cæsars and a Bohemian prince, who by the favor of
the clergy had been elected the titular head of the German aristocracy.
Instead of restoring to Rome her glory and her provinces, he had bound
himself by a secret treaty with the pope, to evacuate the city on the
day of his coronation; and his shameful retreat was pursued by the
reproaches of the patriot bard. <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a>

</p>
<p>
After the loss of liberty and empire, his third and more humble wish was
to reconcile the shepherd with his flock; to recall the Roman bishop
to his ancient and peculiar diocese. In the fervor of youth, with the
authority of age, Petrarch addressed his exhortations to five successive
popes, and his eloquence was always inspired by the enthusiasm of
sentiment and the freedom of language. <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a> The son of a citizen of
Florence invariably preferred the country of his birth to that of his
education; and Italy, in his eyes, was the queen and garden of the
world. Amidst her domestic factions, she was doubtless superior to
France both in art and science, in wealth and politeness; but the
difference could scarcely support the epithet of barbarous, which he
promiscuously bestows on the countries beyond the Alps. Avignon, the
mystic Babylon, the sink of vice and corruption, was the object of his
hatred and contempt; but he forgets that her scandalous vices were not
the growth of the soil, and that in every residence they would adhere to
the power and luxury of the papal court. He confesses that the successor
of St. Peter is the bishop of the universal church; yet it was not on
the banks of the Rhône, but of the Tyber, that the apostle had fixed
his everlasting throne; and while every city in the Christian world was
blessed with a bishop, the metropolis alone was desolate and forlorn.
Since the removal of the Holy See, the sacred buildings of the Lateran
and the Vatican, their altars and their saints, were left in a state
of poverty and decay; and Rome was often painted under the image of a
disconsolate matron, as if the wandering husband could be reclaimed by
the homely portrait of the age and infirmities of his weeping spouse.
<a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a> But the cloud which hung over the seven hills would be dispelled by
the presence of their lawful sovereign: eternal fame, the prosperity of
Rome, and the peace of Italy, would be the recompense of the pope
who should dare to embrace this generous resolution. Of the five whom
Petrarch exhorted, the three first, John the Twenty-second, Benedict
the Twelfth, and Clement the Sixth, were importuned or amused by
the boldness of the orator; but the memorable change which had been
attempted by Urban the Fifth was finally accomplished by Gregory the
Eleventh. The execution of their design was opposed by weighty and
almost insuperable obstacles. A king of France, who has deserved the
epithet of wise, was unwilling to release them from a local dependence:
the cardinals, for the most part his subjects, were attached to the
language, manners, and climate of Avignon; to their stately palaces;
above all, to the wines of Burgundy. In their eyes, Italy was foreign
or hostile; and they reluctantly embarked at Marseilles, as if they had
been sold or banished into the land of the Saracens. Urban the Fifth
resided three years in the Vatican with safety and honor: his sanctity
was protected by a guard of two thousand horse; and the king of Cyprus,
the queen of Naples, and the emperors of the East and West, devoutly
saluted their common father in the chair of St. Peter. But the joy of
Petrarch and the Italians was soon turned into grief and indignation.
Some reasons of public or private moment, his own impatience or the
prayers of the cardinals, recalled Urban to France; and the approaching
election was saved from the tyrannic patriotism of the Romans. The
powers of heaven were interested in their cause: Bridget of Sweden, a
saint and pilgrim, disapproved the return, and foretold the death, of
Urban the Fifth: the migration of Gregory the Eleventh was encouraged
by St. Catharine of Sienna, the spouse of Christ and ambassadress of
the Florentines; and the popes themselves, the great masters of human
credulity, appear to have listened to these visionary females. <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a> Yet
those celestial admonitions were supported by some arguments of temporal
policy. The residents of Avignon had been invaded by hostile violence:
at the head of thirty thousand robbers, a hero had extorted ransom and
absolution from the vicar of Christ and the sacred college; and the
maxim of the French warriors, to spare the people and plunder the
church, was a new heresy of the most dangerous import. <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a> While the
pope was driven from Avignon, he was strenuously invited to Rome. The
senate and people acknowledged him as their lawful sovereign, and laid
at his feet the keys of the gates, the bridges, and the fortresses;
of the quarter at least beyond the Tyber. <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a> But this loyal offer
was accompanied by a declaration, that they could no longer suffer
the scandal and calamity of his absence; and that his obstinacy would
finally provoke them to revive and assert the primitive right of
election. The abbot of Mount Cassin had been consulted, whether he would
accept the triple crown <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a> from the clergy and people: "I am a citizen
of Rome," <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a> replied that venerable ecclesiastic, "and my first law is,

<p>
If superstition will interpret an untimely death, <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> if the merit of
counsels be judged from the event, the heavens may seem to frown on a
measure of such apparent season and propriety. Gregory the Eleventh did
not survive above fourteen months his return to the Vatican; and his
decease was followed by the great schism of the West, which distracted
the Latin church above forty years. The sacred college was then composed
of twenty-two cardinals: six of these had remained at Avignon; eleven
Frenchmen, one Spaniard, and four Italians, entered the conclave in the
usual form. Their choice was not yet limited to the purple; and their
unanimous votes acquiesced in the archbishop of Bari, a subject of
Naples, conspicuous for his zeal and learning, who ascended the throne
of St. Peter under the name of Urban the Sixth. The epistle of the
sacred college affirms his free, and regular, election; which had been
inspired, as usual, by the Holy Ghost; he was adored, invested, and
crowned, with the customary rites; his temporal authority was obeyed at
Rome and Avignon, and his ecclesiastical supremacy was acknowledged in
the Latin world. During several weeks, the cardinals attended their new
master with the fairest professions of attachment and loyalty; till the
summer heats permitted a decent escape from the city. But as soon as
they were united at Anagni and Fundi, in a place of security, they
cast aside the mask, accused their own falsehood and hypocrisy,
excommunicated the apostate and antichrist of Rome, and proceeded to
a new election of Robert of Geneva, Clement the Seventh, whom they
announced to the nations as the true and rightful vicar of Christ. Their
first choice, an involuntary and illegal act, was annulled by fear of
death and the menaces of the Romans; and their complaint is justified
by the strong evidence of probability and fact. The twelve French
cardinals, above two thirds of the votes, were masters of the election;
and whatever might be their provincial jealousies, it cannot fairly be
presumed that they would have sacrificed their right and interest to a
foreign candidate, who would never restore them to their native country.
In the various, and often inconsistent, narratives, <a href="#note-66" name="noteref-66"><small>66</small></a> the shades
of popular violence are more darkly or faintly colored: but the
licentiousness of the seditious Romans was inflamed by a sense of their
privileges, and the danger of a second emigration. The conclave was
intimidated by the shouts, and encompassed by the arms, of thirty
thousand rebels; the bells of the Capitol and St. Peter's rang an alarm:
"Death, or an Italian pope!" was the universal cry; the same threat was
repeated by the twelve bannerets or chiefs of the quarters, in the
form of charitable advice; some preparations were made for burning the
obstinate cardinals; and had they chosen a Transalpine subject, it is
probable that they would never have departed alive from the Vatican. The
same constraint imposed the necessity of dissembling in the eyes of
Rome and of the world; the pride and cruelty of Urban presented a more
inevitable danger; and they soon discovered the features of the tyrant,
who could walk in his garden and recite his breviary, while he heard
from an adjacent chamber six cardinals groaning on the rack. His
inflexible zeal, which loudly censured their luxury and vice, would have
attached them to the stations and duties of their parishes at Rome; and
had he not fatally delayed a new promotion, the French cardinals would
have been reduced to a helpless minority in the sacred college. For
these reasons, and the hope of repassing the Alps, they rashly violated
the peace and unity of the church; and the merits of their double choice
are yet agitated in the Catholic schools. <a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a> The vanity, rather than
the interest, of the nation determined the court and clergy of France.
<a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a> The states of Savoy, Sicily, Cyprus, Arragon, Castille, Navarre, and
Scotland were inclined by their example and authority to the obedience
of Clement the Seventh, and after his decease, of Benedict the
Thirteenth. Rome and the principal states of Italy, Germany, Portugal,
England, <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a> the Low Countries, and the kingdoms of the North, adhered
to the prior election of Urban the Sixth, who was succeeded by Boniface

From the banks of the Tyber and the Rhône, the hostile pontiffs
encountered each other with the pen and the sword: the civil and
ecclesiastical order of society was disturbed; and the Romans had
their full share of the mischiefs of which they may be arraigned as the
primary authors. <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a> They had vainly flattered themselves with the hope
of restoring the seat of the ecclesiastical monarchy, and of relieving
their poverty with the tributes and offerings of the nations; but
the separation of France and Spain diverted the stream of lucrative
devotion; nor could the loss be compensated by the two jubilees which
were crowded into the space of ten years. By the avocations of the
schism, by foreign arms, and popular tumults, Urban the Sixth and his
three successors were often compelled to interrupt their residence in
the Vatican. The Colonna and Ursini still exercised their deadly feuds:
the bannerets of Rome asserted and abused the privileges of a republic:
the vicars of Christ, who had levied a military force, chastised their
rebellion with the gibbet, the sword, and the dagger; and, in a friendly
conference, eleven deputies of the people were perfidiously murdered
and cast into the street. Since the invasion of Robert the Norman,
the Romans had pursued their domestic quarrels without the dangerous
interposition of a stranger. But in the disorders of the schism, an
aspiring neighbor, Ladislaus king of Naples, alternately supported
and betrayed the pope and the people; by the former he was declared
<i>gonfalonier</i>, or general, of the church, while the latter submitted to
his choice the nomination of their magistrates. Besieging Rome by
land and water, he thrice entered the gates as a Barbarian conqueror;
profaned the altars, violated the virgins, pillaged the merchants,
performed his devotions at St. Peter's, and left a garrison in the
castle of St. Angelo. His arms were sometimes unfortunate, and to
a delay of three days he was indebted for his life and crown: but
Ladislaus triumphed in his turn; and it was only his premature death
that could save the metropolis and the ecclesiastical state from the
ambitious conqueror, who had assumed the title, or at least the powers,

I have not undertaken the ecclesiastical history of the schism; but
Rome, the object of these last chapters, is deeply interested in the
disputed succession of her sovereigns. The first counsels for the peace
and union of Christendom arose from the university of Paris, from the
faculty of the Sorbonne, whose doctors were esteemed, at least in the
Gallican church, as the most consummate masters of theological science.
<a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a> Prudently waiving all invidious inquiry into the origin and merits
of the dispute, they proposed, as a healing measure, that the two
pretenders of Rome and Avignon should abdicate at the same time, after
qualifying the cardinals of the adverse factions to join in a legitimate
election; and that the nations should <i>subtract</i> <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a> their obedience,
if either of the competitor preferred his own interest to that of the
public. At each vacancy, these physicians of the church deprecated the
mischiefs of a hasty choice; but the policy of the conclave and
the ambition of its members were deaf to reason and entreaties; and
whatsoever promises were made, the pope could never be bound by the
oaths of the cardinal. During fifteen years, the pacific designs of the
university were eluded by the arts of the rival pontiffs, the scruples
or passions of their adherents, and the vicissitudes of French factions,
that ruled the insanity of Charles the Sixth. At length a vigorous
resolution was embraced; and a solemn embassy, of the titular patriarch
of Alexandria, two archbishops, five bishops, five abbots, three
knights, and twenty doctors, was sent to the courts of Avignon and Rome,
to require, in the name of the church and king, the abdication of
the two pretenders, of Peter de Luna, who styled himself Benedict the
Thirteenth, and of Angelo Corrario, who assumed the name of Gregory
the Twelfth. For the ancient honor of Rome, and the success of their
commission, the ambassadors solicited a conference with the magistrates
of the city, whom they gratified by a positive declaration, that the
most Christian king did not entertain a wish of transporting the holy
see from the Vatican, which he considered as the genuine and proper seat
of the successor of St. Peter. In the name of the senate and people, an
eloquent Roman asserted their desire to cooperate in the union of the
church, deplored the temporal and spiritual calamities of the long
schism, and requested the protection of France against the arms of the
king of Naples. The answers of Benedict and Gregory were alike edifying
and alike deceitful; and, in evading the demand of their abdication,
the two rivals were animated by a common spirit. They agreed on the
necessity of a previous interview; but the time, the place, and the
manner, could never be ascertained by mutual consent. "If the one
advances," says a servant of Gregory, "the other retreats; the one
appears an animal fearful of the land, the other a creature apprehensive
of the water. And thus, for a short remnant of life and power, will
these aged priests endanger the peace and salvation of the Christian
world." <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a>

filled by a similar election of John the Twenty-third, the most
profligate of mankind. But instead of extinguishing the schism, the
rashness of the French and Italians had given a third pretender to
the chair of St. Peter. Such new claims of the synod and conclave were
disputed; three kings, of Germany, Hungary, and Naples, adhered to the
cause of Gregory the Twelfth; and Benedict the Thirteenth, himself
a Spaniard, was acknowledged by the devotion and patriotism of that
powerful nation. The rash proceedings of Pisa were corrected by the
council of Constance; the emperor Sigismond acted a conspicuous part
as the advocate or protector of the Catholic church; and the number and
weight of civil and ecclesiastical members might seem to constitute the
states-general of Europe. Of the three popes, John the Twenty-third
was the first victim: he fled and was brought back a prisoner: the most
scandalous charges were suppressed; the vicar of Christ was only accused
of piracy, murder, rape, sodomy, and incest; and after subscribing his
own condemnation, he expiated in prison the imprudence of trusting
his person to a free city beyond the Alps. Gregory the Twelfth, whose
obedience was reduced to the narrow precincts of Rimini, descended with
more honor from the throne; and his ambassador convened the session, in
which he renounced the title and authority of lawful pope. To vanquish
the obstinacy of Benedict the Thirteenth or his adherents, the emperor
in person undertook a journey from Constance to Perpignan. The kings of
Castile, Arragon, Navarre, and Scotland, obtained an equal and honorable
treaty; with the concurrence of the Spaniards, Benedict was deposed by
the council; but the harmless old man was left in a solitary castle to
excommunicate twice each day the rebel kingdoms which had deserted his
cause. After thus eradicating the remains of the schism, the synod of
Constance proceeded with slow and cautious steps to elect the sovereign
of Rome and the head of the church. On this momentous occasion, the
college of twenty-three cardinals was fortified with thirty deputies;
six of whom were chosen in each of the five great nations of
Christendom,&mdash;the Italian, the German, the French, the Spanish, and
the <i>English</i>: <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a> the interference of strangers was softened by their
generous preference of an Italian and a Roman; and the hereditary, as
well as personal, merit of Otho Colonna recommended him to the conclave.
Rome accepted with joy and obedience the noblest of her sons; the
ecclesiastical state was defended by his powerful family; and the
elevation of Martin the Fifth is the æra of the restoration and
establishment of the popes in the Vatican. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a>

[ I cannot overlook this great national cause, which was
vigorously maintained by the English ambassadors against those
of France. The latter contended, that Christendom was essentially
distributed into the four great nations and votes, of Italy, Germany,
France, and Spain, and that the lesser kingdoms (such as England,
Denmark, Portugal, &amp;c.) were comprehended under one or other of these
great divisions. The English asserted, that the British islands, of
which they were the head, should be considered as a fifth and coördinate
nation, with an equal vote; and every argument of truth or fable was
introduced to exalt the dignity of their country. Including England,
Scotland, Wales, the four kingdoms of Ireland, and the Orkneys, the
British Islands are decorated with eight royal crowns, and discriminated
by four or five languages, English, Welsh, Cornish, Scotch, Irish, &amp;c.
The greater island from north to south measures 800 miles, or 40 days'
journey; and England alone contains 32 counties and 52,000 parish
churches, (a bold account!) besides cathedrals, colleges, priories, and
hospitals. They celebrate the mission of St. Joseph of Arimathea, the
birth of Constantine, and the legatine powers of the two primates,
without forgetting the testimony of Bartholomey de Glanville, (A.D.
1360,) who reckons only four Christian kingdoms, 1. of Rome, 2. of
Constantinople, 3. of Ireland, which had been transferred to the English
monarchs, and 4, of Spain. Our countrymen prevailed in the council,
but the victories of Henry V. added much weight to their arguments.
The adverse pleadings were found at Constance by Sir Robert Wingfield,
ambassador of Henry VIII. to the emperor Maximilian I., and by him
printed in 1517 at Louvain. From a Leipsic MS. they are more correctly
published in the collection of Von der Hardt, tom. v.; but I have only

<h2>
    Chapter LXX: Final Settlement Of The Ecclesiastical State.&mdash;Part IV.
</h2>
<p>
The royal prerogative of coining money, which had been exercised near
three hundred years by the senate, was <i>first</i> resumed by Martin the
Fifth, <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a> and his image and superscription introduce the series of the
papal medals. Of his two immediate successors, Eugenius the Fourth was
the <i>last</i> pope expelled by the tumults of the Roman people, <a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> and
Nicholas the Fifth, the <i>last</i> who was importuned by the presence of
a Roman emperor. <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a> I. The conflict of Eugenius with the fathers of
Basil, and the weight or apprehension of a new excise, emboldened and
provoked the Romans to usurp the temporal government of the city. They
rose in arms, elected seven governors of the republic, and a constable
of the Capitol; imprisoned the pope's nephew; besieged his person in the
palace; and shot volleys of arrows into his bark as he escaped down the
Tyber in the habit of a monk. But he still possessed in the castle of
St. Angelo a faithful garrison and a train of artillery: their batteries
incessantly thundered on the city, and a bullet more dexterously pointed
broke down the barricade of the bridge, and scattered with a single shot
the heroes of the republic. Their constancy was exhausted by a rebellion
of five months. Under the tyranny of the Ghibeline nobles, the wisest
patriots regretted the dominion of the church; and their repentance
was unanimous and effectual. The troops of St. Peter again occupied the
Capitol; the magistrates departed to their homes; the most guilty were
executed or exiled; and the legate, at the head of two thousand foot and
four thousand horse, was saluted as the father of the city. The synods
of Ferrara and Florence, the fear or resentment of Eugenius, prolonged
his absence: he was received by a submissive people; but the pontiff
understood from the acclamations of his triumphal entry, that to secure
their loyalty and his own repose, he must grant without delay the
abolition of the odious excise. II. Rome was restored, adorned, and
enlightened, by the peaceful reign of Nicholas the Fifth. In the midst
of these laudable occupations, the pope was alarmed by the approach of
Frederic the Third of Austria; though his fears could not be justified
by the character or the power of the Imperial candidate. After drawing
his military force to the metropolis, and imposing the best security of
oaths <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a> and treaties, Nicholas received with a smiling countenance the
faithful advocate and vassal of the church. So tame were the times,
so feeble was the Austrian, that the pomp of his coronation was
accomplished with order and harmony: but the superfluous honor was so
disgraceful to an independent nation, that his successors have excused
themselves from the toilsome pilgrimage to the Vatican; and rest their
Imperial title on the choice of the electors of Germany.

<p>
A citizen has remarked, with pride and pleasure, that the king of the
Romans, after passing with a slight salute the cardinals and prelates
who met him at the gate, distinguished the dress and person of the
senator of Rome; and in this last farewell, the pageants of the empire
and the republic were clasped in a friendly embrace. <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a> According to
the laws of Rome, <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a> her first magistrate was required to be a doctor
of laws, an alien, of a place at least forty miles from the city; with
whose inhabitants he must not be connected in the third canonical degree
of blood or alliance. The election was annual: a severe scrutiny was
instituted into the conduct of the departing senator; nor could he be
recalled to the same office till after the expiration of two years. A
liberal salary of three thousand florins was assigned for his expense
and reward; and his public appearance represented the majesty of the
republic. His robes were of gold brocade or crimson velvet, or in the
summer season of a lighter silk: he bore in his hand an ivory sceptre;
the sound of trumpets announced his approach; and his solemn steps were
preceded at least by four lictors or attendants, whose red wands were
enveloped with bands or streamers of the golden color or livery of the
city. His oath in the Capitol proclaims his right and duty to observe
and assert the laws, to control the proud, to protect the poor, and to
exercise justice and mercy within the extent of his jurisdiction. In
these useful functions he was assisted by three learned strangers; the
two <i>collaterals</i>, and the judge of criminal appeals: their frequent
trials of robberies, rapes, and murders, are attested by the laws; and
the weakness of these laws connives at the licentiousness of private
feuds and armed associations for mutual defence. But the senator was
confined to the administration of justice: the Capitol, the treasury,
and the government of the city and its territory, were intrusted to
the three <i>conservators</i>, who were changed four times in each year: the
militia of the thirteen regions assembled under the banners of
their respective chiefs, or <i>caporioni</i>; and the first of these was
distinguished by the name and dignity of the <i>prior</i>. The popular
legislature consisted of the secret and the common councils of the
Romans. The former was composed of the magistrates and their immediate
predecessors, with some fiscal and legal officers, and three classes of
thirteen, twenty-six, and forty, counsellors: amounting in the whole
to about one hundred and twenty persons. In the common council all
male citizens had a right to vote; and the value of their privilege
was enhanced by the care with which any foreigners were prevented from
usurping the title and character of Romans. The tumult of a democracy
was checked by wise and jealous precautions: except the magistrates,
none could propose a question; none were permitted to speak, except from
an open pulpit or tribunal; all disorderly acclamations were suppressed;
the sense of the majority was decided by a secret ballot; and their
decrees were promulgated in the venerable name of the Roman senate and
people. It would not be easy to assign a period in which this theory of
government has been reduced to accurate and constant practice, since the
establishment of order has been gradually connected with the decay
of liberty. But in the year one thousand five hundred and eighty the
ancient statutes were collected, methodized in three books, and adapted
to present use, under the pontificate, and with the approbation, of
Gregory the Thirteenth: <a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a> this civil and criminal code is the modern
law of the city; and, if the popular assemblies have been abolished,
a foreign senator, with the three conservators, still resides in the
palace of the Capitol. <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a> The policy of the Cæsars has been repeated
by the popes; and the bishop of Rome affected to maintain the form of
a republic, while he reigned with the absolute powers of a temporal, as
well as a spiritual, monarch.

<p>
It is an obvious truth, that the times must be suited to extraordinary
characters, and that the genius of Cromwell or Retz might now expire
in obscurity. The political enthusiasm of Rienzi had exalted him to a
throne; the same enthusiasm, in the next century, conducted his imitator
to the gallows. The birth of Stephen Porcaro was noble, his reputation
spotless: his tongue was armed with eloquence, his mind was enlightened
with learning; and he aspired, beyond the aim of vulgar ambition, to
free his country and immortalize his name. The dominion of priests is
most odious to a liberal spirit: every scruple was removed by the recent
knowledge of the fable and forgery of Constantine's donation; Petrarch
was now the oracle of the Italians; and as often as Porcaro revolved the
ode which describes the patriot and hero of Rome, he applied to himself
the visions of the prophetic bard. His first trial of the popular
feelings was at the funeral of Eugenius the Fourth: in an elaborate
speech he called the Romans to liberty and arms; and they listened with
apparent pleasure, till Porcaro was interrupted and answered by a
grave advocate, who pleaded for the church and state. By every law the
seditious orator was guilty of treason; but the benevolence of the new
pontiff, who viewed his character with pity and esteem, attempted by an
honorable office to convert the patriot into a friend. The inflexible
Roman returned from Anagni with an increase of reputation and zeal; and,
on the first opportunity, the games of the place Navona, he tried to
inflame the casual dispute of some boys and mechanics into a general
rising of the people. Yet the humane Nicholas was still averse to accept
the forfeit of his life; and the traitor was removed from the scene of
temptation to Bologna, with a liberal allowance for his support, and the
easy obligation of presenting himself each day before the governor of
the city. But Porcaro had learned from the younger Brutus, that with
tyrants no faith or gratitude should be observed: the exile declaimed
against the arbitrary sentence; a party and a conspiracy were gradually
formed: his nephew, a daring youth, assembled a band of volunteers;
and on the appointed evening a feast was prepared at his house for the
friends of the republic. Their leader, who had escaped from Bologna,
appeared among them in a robe of purple and gold: his voice, his
countenance, his gestures, bespoke the man who had devoted his life or
death to the glorious cause. In a studied oration, he expiated on the
motives and the means of their enterprise; the name and liberties of
Rome; the sloth and pride of their ecclesiastical tyrants; the active
or passive consent of their fellow-citizens; three hundred soldiers, and
four hundred exiles, long exercised in arms or in wrongs; the license
of revenge to edge their swords, and a million of ducats to reward their
victory. It would be easy, (he said,) on the next day, the festival of
the Epiphany, to seize the pope and his cardinals, before the doors, or
at the altar, of St. Peter's; to lead them in chains under the walls of
St. Angelo; to extort by the threat of their instant death a surrender
of the castle; to ascend the vacant Capitol; to ring the alarm bell; and
to restore in a popular assembly the ancient republic of Rome. While he
triumphed, he was already betrayed. The senator, with a strong guard,
invested the house: the nephew of Porcaro cut his way through the crowd;
but the unfortunate Stephen was drawn from a chest, lamenting that his
enemies had anticipated by three hours the execution of his design.
After such manifest and repeated guilt, even the mercy of Nicholas was
silent. Porcaro, and nine of his accomplices, were hanged without the
benefit of the sacraments; and, amidst the fears and invectives of the
papal court, the Romans pitied, and almost applauded, these martyrs of
their country. <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> But their applause was mute, their pity ineffectual,
their liberty forever extinct; and, if they have since risen in a
vacancy of the throne or a scarcity of bread, such accidental tumults
may be found in the bosom of the most abject servitude.

But the independence of the nobles, which was fomented by discord,
survived the freedom of the commons, which must be founded in union. A
privilege of rapine and oppression was long maintained by the barons of
Rome; their houses were a fortress and a sanctuary: and the ferocious
train of banditti and criminals whom they protected from the law repaid
the hospitality with the service of their swords and daggers. The
private interest of the pontiffs, or their nephews, sometimes involved
them in these domestic feuds. Under the reign of Sixtus the Fourth, Rome
was distracted by the battles and sieges of the rival houses: after the
conflagration of his palace, the prothonotary Colonna was tortured and
beheaded; and Savelli, his captive friend, was murdered on the spot, for
refusing to join in the acclamations of the victorious Ursini. <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a>

The spiritual thunders of the Vatican depend on the force of opinion;
and if that opinion be supplanted by reason or passion, the sound may
idly waste itself in the air; and the helpless priest is exposed to
the brutal violence of a noble or a plebeian adversary. But after their
return from Avignon, the keys of St. Peter were guarded by the sword
of St. Paul. Rome was commanded by an impregnable citadel: the use of
cannon is a powerful engine against popular seditions: a regular force
of cavalry and infantry was enlisted under the banners of the pope: his
ample revenues supplied the resources of war: and, from the extent of
his domain, he could bring down on a rebellious city an army of hostile
neighbors and loyal subjects. <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a> Since the union of the duchies
of Ferrara and Urbino, the ecclesiastical state extends from the
Mediterranean to the Adriatic, and from the confines of Naples to the
banks of the Po; and as early as the sixteenth century, the greater part
of that spacious and fruitful country acknowledged the lawful claims and
temporal sovereignty of the Roman pontiffs. Their claims were readily
deduced from the genuine, or fabulous, donations of the darker ages: the
successive steps of their final settlement would engage us too far in
the transactions of Italy, and even of Europe; the crimes of Alexander
the Sixth, the martial operations of Julius the Second, and the liberal
policy of Leo the Tenth, a theme which has been adorned by the pens of
the noblest historians of the times. <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a> In the first period of their
conquests, till the expedition of Charles the Eighth, the popes might
successfully wrestle with the adjacent princes and states, whose
military force was equal, or inferior, to their own. But as soon as the
monarchs of France, Germany and Spain, contended with gigantic arms
for the dominion of Italy, they supplied with art the deficiency of
strength; and concealed, in a labyrinth of wars and treaties, their
aspiring views, and the immortal hope of chasing the Barbarians beyond
the Alps. The nice balance of the Vatican was often subverted by the
soldiers of the North and West, who were united under the standard of
Charles the Fifth: the feeble and fluctuating policy of Clement the
Seventh exposed his person and dominions to the conqueror; and Rome was
abandoned seven months to a lawless army, more cruel and rapacious
than the Goths and Vandals. <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a> After this severe lesson, the popes
contracted their ambition, which was almost satisfied, resumed
the character of a common parent, and abstained from all offensive
hostilities, except in a hasty quarrel, when the vicar of Christ and
the Turkish sultan were armed at the same time against the kingdom of
Naples. <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a> The French and Germans at length withdrew from the field of
battle: Milan, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and the sea-coast of Tuscany,
were firmly possessed by the Spaniards; and it became their interest
to maintain the peace and dependence of Italy, which continued almost
without disturbance from the middle of the sixteenth to the opening
of the eighteenth century. The Vatican was swayed and protected by
the religious policy of the Catholic king: his prejudice and interest
disposed him in every dispute to support the prince against the people;
and instead of the encouragement, the aid, and the asylum, which they
obtained from the adjacent states, the friends of liberty, or the
enemies of law, were enclosed on all sides within the iron circle
of despotism. The long habits of obedience and education subdued the
turbulent spirit of the nobles and commons of Rome. The barons forgot
the arms and factions of their ancestors, and insensibly became the
servants of luxury and government. Instead of maintaining a crowd of
tenants and followers, the produce of their estates was consumed in the
private expenses which multiply the pleasures, and diminish the power,
of the lord. <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a> The Colonna and Ursini vied with each other in the
decoration of their palaces and chapels; and their antique splendor was
rivalled or surpassed by the sudden opulence of the papal families. In
Rome the voice of freedom and discord is no longer heard; and, instead
of the foaming torrent, a smooth and stagnant lake reflects the image of
idleness and servitude.

iv p. 149&mdash;163.) Those Catholic bigots, Philip II. and the duke of Alva,
presumed to separate the Roman prince from the vicar of Christ, yet the
holy character, which would have sanctified his victory was decently
applied to protect his defeat. * Note: But compare Ranke, Die Römischen
Päpste, i. p. 289.&mdash;M.]

[ This gradual change of manners and expense is admirably
explained by Dr. Adam Smith, (Wealth of Nations, vol. i. p. 495&mdash;504,)
who proves, perhaps too severely, that the most salutary effects have
flowed from the meanest and most selfish causes.]

<p>
A Christian, a philosopher, <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a> and a patriot, will be equally
scandalized by the temporal kingdom of the clergy; and the local majesty
of Rome, the remembrance of her consuls and triumphs, may seem to
imbitter the sense, and aggravate the shame, of her slavery. If we
calmly weigh the merits and defects of the ecclesiastical government,
it may be praised in its present state, as a mild, decent, and tranquil
system, exempt from the dangers of a minority, the sallies of youth, the
expenses of luxury, and the calamities of war. But these advantages
are overbalanced by a frequent, perhaps a septennial, election of a
sovereign, who is seldom a native of the country; the reign of a <i>young</i>
statesman of threescore, in the decline of his life and abilities,
without hope to accomplish, and without children to inherit, the labors
of his transitory reign. The successful candidate is drawn from the
church, and even the convent; from the mode of education and life
the most adverse to reason, humanity, and freedom. In the trammels of
servile faith, he has learned to believe because it is absurd, to revere
all that is contemptible, and to despise whatever might deserve the
esteem of a rational being; to punish error as a crime, to reward
mortification and celibacy as the first of virtues; to place the saints
of the calendar <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a> above the heroes of Rome and the sages of Athens;
and to consider the missal, or the crucifix, as more useful instruments
than the plough or the loom. In the office of nuncio, or the rank of
cardinal, he may acquire some knowledge of the world, but the primitive
stain will adhere to his mind and manners: from study and experience
he may suspect the mystery of his profession; but the sacerdotal artist
will imbibe some portion of the bigotry which he inculcates. The genius
of Sixtus the Fifth <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a> burst from the gloom of a Franciscan cloister.
In a reign of five years, he exterminated the outlaws and banditti,
abolished the <i>profane</i> sanctuaries of Rome, <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a> formed a naval and
military force, restored and emulated the monuments of antiquity,
and after a liberal use and large increase of the revenue, left five
millions of crowns in the castle of St. Angelo. But his justice was
sullied with cruelty, his activity was prompted by the ambition of
conquest: after his decease the abuses revived; the treasure was
dissipated; he entailed on posterity thirty-five new taxes and the
venality of offices; and, after his death, his statue was demolished
by an ungrateful, or an injured, people. <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a> The wild and original
character of Sixtus the Fifth stands alone in the series of the
pontiffs; the maxims and effects of their temporal government may
be collected from the positive and comparative view of the arts and
philosophy, the agriculture and trade, the wealth and population, of
the ecclesiastical state. For myself, it is my wish to depart in charity
with all mankind, nor am I willing, in these last moments, to offend
even the pope and clergy of Rome. <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a>

[ A wandering Italian, Gregorio Leti, has given the Vita di
Sisto-Quinto, (Amstel. 1721, 3 vols. in 12mo.,) a copious and amusing
work, but which does not command our absolute confidence. Yet the
character of the man, and the principal facts, are supported by
the annals of Spondanus and Muratori, (A.D. 1585&mdash;1590,) and the
contemporary history of the great Thuanus, (l. lxxxii. c. 1, 2, l.
lxxxiv. c. 10, l. c. c. 8.) * Note: The industry of M. Ranke has
discovered the document, a kind of scandalous chronicle of the time,
from which Leti wrought up his amusing romances. See also M. Ranke's
observations on the Life of Sixtus. by Tempesti, b. iii. p. 317, 324.&mdash;

were adopted from the Roman nobles by the foreign ministers. Julius
II. had once abolished the abominandum et detestandum franchitiarum

discern either the justice or magnanimity of Louis XIV., who, in 1687,
sent his ambassador, the marquis de Lavardin, to Rome, with an armed
force of a thousand officers, guards, and domestics, to maintain this
iniquitous claim, and insult Pope Innocent XI. in the heart of his
capital, (Vita di Sisto V. tom. iii. p. 260&mdash;278. Muratori, Annali

Except the last, all these fragments and diaries are inserted in the
Collections of Muratori, my guide and master in the history of Italy.
His country, and the public, are indebted to him for the following works
on that subject: 1. <i>Rerum Italicarum Scriptores</i>, (A.D. 500&mdash;1500,)
<i>quorum potissima pars nunc primum in lucem prodit</i>, &amp;c., xxviii.
vols. in folio, Milan, 1723&mdash;1738, 1751. A volume of chronological and
alphabetical tables is still wanting as a key to this great work, which
is yet in a disorderly and defective state. 2. <i>Antiquitates Italiæ
Medii Ævi</i>, vi. vols. in folio, Milan, 1738&mdash;1743, in lxxv. curious
dissertations, on the manners, government, religion, &amp;c., of the
Italians of the darker ages, with a large supplement of charters,
chronicles, &amp;c. 3. <i>Dissertazioni sopra le Antiquita Italiane</i>, iii.
vols. in 4to., Milano, 1751, a free version by the author, which may be
quoted with the same confidence as the Latin text of the Antiquities.
<i>Annali d' Italia</i>, xviii. vols. in octavo, Milan, 1753&mdash;1756, a dry,
though accurate and useful, abridgment of the history of Italy, from
the birth of Christ to the middle of the xviiith century. 5. <i>Dell'
Antichita Estense ed Italiane</i>, ii. vols. in folio, Modena, 1717, 1740.
In the history of this illustrious race, the parent of our Brunswick
kings, the critic is not seduced by the loyalty or gratitude of the
subject. In all his works, Muratori approves himself a diligent and
laborious writer, who aspires above the prejudices of a Catholic priest.
He was born in the year 1672, and died in the year 1750, after passing
near 60 years in the libraries of Milan and Modena, (Vita del Proposto
Ludovico Antonio Muratori, by his nephew and successor Gian. Francesco
Soli Muratori Venezia, 1756 m 4to.)]
