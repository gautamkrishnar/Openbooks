<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>Permit me in the first place to anticipate the disappointment of
any student who opens this book with the idea of finding "wrinkles"
on how to draw faces, trees, clouds, or what not, short cuts to
excellence in drawing, or any of the tricks so popular with the
drawing masters of our grandmothers and still dearly loved by a
large number of people. No good can come of such methods, for there
are no short cuts to excellence. But help of a very practical kind
it is the aim of the following pages to give; although it may be
necessary to make a greater call upon the intelligence of the
student than these Victorian methods attempted.</p>
<p>It was not until some time after having passed through the
course of training in two of our chief schools of art that the
author got any idea of what drawing really meant. What was taught
was the faithful copying of a series of objects, beginning with the
simplest forms, such as cubes, cones, cylinders, &amp;c. (an
excellent system to begin with at present in danger of some
neglect), after which more complicated objects in plaster of Paris
were attempted, and finally copies of the human head and figure
posed in suspended animation and supported by blocks, &amp;c. In so
far as this was accurately done, all this mechanical training of
eye and hand was excellent; but it was not enough. And when with an
eye trained to the closest mechanical <a name='Page_vi' id=
"Page_vi"></a><span class='pagenum'>vi</span>accuracy the author
visited the galleries of the Continent and studied the drawings of
the old masters, it soon became apparent that either his or their
ideas of drawing were all wrong. Very few drawings could be found
sufficiently "like the model" to obtain the prize at either of the
great schools he had attended. Luckily there was just enough
modesty left for him to realise that possibly they were in some
mysterious way right and his own training in some way lacking. And
so he set to work to try and climb the long uphill road that
separates mechanically accurate drawing from artistically accurate
drawing.</p>
<p>Now this journey should have been commenced much earlier, and
perhaps it was due to his own stupidity that it was not; but it was
with a vague idea of saving some students from such
wrong-headedness, and possibly straightening out some of the path,
that he accepted the invitation to write this book.</p>
<p>In writing upon any matter of experience, such as art, the
possibilities of misunderstanding are enormous, and one shudders to
think of the things that may be put down to one's credit, owing to
such misunderstandings. It is like writing about the taste of
sugar, you are only likely to be understood by those who have
already experienced the flavour; by those who have not, the wildest
interpretation will be put upon your words. The written word is
necessarily confined to the things of the understanding because
only the understanding has written language; whereas art deals with
ideas of a different mental texture, which words can only vaguely
suggest. However, there are a large number of people who, although
they cannot <a name='Page_vii' id="Page_vii"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>vii</span>be said to have experienced in a full sense any
works of art, have undoubtedly the impelling desire which a little
direction may lead on to a fuller appreciation. And it is to such
that books on art are useful. So that although this book is
primarily addressed to working students, it is hoped that it may be
of interest to that increasing number of people who, tired with the
rush and struggle of modern existence, seek refreshment in artistic
things. To many such in this country modern art is still a closed
book; its point of view is so different from that of the art they
have been brought up with, that they refuse to have anything to do
with it. Whereas, if they only took the trouble to find out
something of the point of view of the modern artist, they would
discover new beauties they little suspected.</p>
<p>If anybody looks at a picture by Claude Monet from the point of
view of a Raphael, he will see nothing but a meaningless jargon of
wild paint-strokes. And if anybody looks at a Raphael from the
point of view of a Claude Monet, he will, no doubt, only see hard,
tinny figures in a setting devoid of any of the lovely atmosphere
that always envelops form seen in nature. So wide apart are some of
the points of view in painting. In the treatment of form these
differences in point of view make for enormous variety in the work.
So that no apology need be made for the large amount of space
occupied in the following pages by what is usually dismissed as
mere theory; but what is in reality the first essential of any good
practice in drawing. To have a clear idea of what it is you wish to
do, is the first necessity of any successful performance. But our
exhibitions are <a name='Page_viii' id="Page_viii"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>viii</span>full of works that show how seldom this is the
case in art. Works showing much ingenuity and ability, but no
artistic brains; pictures that are little more than school studies,
exercises in the representation of carefully or carelessly arranged
objects, but cold to any artistic intention.</p>
<p>At this time particularly some principles, and a clear
intellectual understanding of what it is you are trying to do, are
needed. We have no set traditions to guide us. The times when the
student accepted the style and traditions of his master and blindly
followed them until he found himself, are gone. Such conditions
belonged to an age when intercommunication was difficult, and when
the artistic horizon was restricted to a single town or province.
Science has altered all that, and we may regret the loss of local
colour and singleness of aim this growth of art in separate
compartments produced; but it is unlikely that such conditions will
occur again. Quick means of transit and cheap methods of
reproduction have brought the art of the whole world to our doors.
Where formerly the artistic food at the disposal of the student was
restricted to the few pictures in his vicinity and some prints of
others, now there is scarcely a picture of note in the world that
is not known to the average student, either from personal
inspection at our museums and loan exhibitions, or from excellent
photographic reproductions. Not only European art, but the art of
the East, China and Japan, is part of the formative influence by
which he is surrounded; not to mention the modern science of light
and colour that has had such an influence on technique. It is no
wonder that a period of artistic indigestion is upon us. Hence the
student has need <a name='Page_ix' id="Page_ix"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>ix</span>of sound principles and a clear understanding of
the science of his art, if he would select from this mass of
material those things which answer to his own inner need for
artistic expression.</p>
<p>The position of art to-day is like that of a river where many
tributaries meeting at one point, suddenly turn the steady flow to
turbulence, the many streams jostling each other and the different
currents pulling hither and thither. After a time these newly-met
forces will adjust themselves to the altered condition, and a
larger, finer stream be the result. Something analogous to this
would seem to be happening in art at the present time, when all
nations and all schools are acting and reacting upon each other,
and art is losing its national characteristics. The hope of the
future is that a larger and deeper art, answering to the altered
conditions of humanity, will result.</p>
<p>There are those who would leave this scene of struggling
influences and away up on some bare primitive mountain-top start a
new stream, begin all over again. But however necessary it may be
to give the primitive mountain waters that were the start of all
the streams a more prominent place in the new flow onwards, it is
unlikely that much can come of any attempt to leave the turbulent
waters, go backwards, and start again; they can only flow onwards.
To speak more plainly, the complexity of modern art influences may
make it necessary to call attention to the primitive principles of
expression that should never be lost sight of in any work, but
hardly justifies the attitude of those anarchists in art who would
flout the heritage of culture we possess and attempt a new start.
Such attempts however when sincere are interesting <a name='Page_x'
id="Page_x"></a><span class='pagenum'>x</span>and may be productive
of some new vitality, adding to the weight of the main stream. But
it must be along the main stream, along lines in harmony with
tradition that the chief advance must be looked for.</p>
<p>Although it has been felt necessary to devote much space to an
attempt to find principles that may be said to be at the basis of
the art of all nations, the executive side of the question has not
been neglected. And it is hoped that the logical method for the
study of drawing from the two opposite points of view of line and
mass here advocated may be useful, and help students to avoid some
of the confusion that results from attempting simultaneously the
study of these different qualities of form expression.</p>

<h2>I<br />
INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The best things in an artist's work are so much a matter of
intuition, that there is much to be said for the point of view that
would altogether discourage intellectual inquiry into artistic
phenomena on the part of the artist. Intuitions are shy things and
apt to disappear if looked into too closely. And there is
undoubtedly a danger that too much knowledge and training may
supplant the natural intuitive feeling of a student, leaving only a
cold knowledge of the means of expression in its place. For the
artist, if he has the right stuff in him, has a consciousness, in
doing his best work, of something, as Ruskin has said, "not in him
but through him." He has been, as it were, but the agent through
which it has found expression.</p>
<p>Talent can be described as "that which we have," and Genius as
"that which has us." Now, although we may have little control over
this power that "has us," and although it may be as well to abandon
oneself unreservedly to its influence, there can be little doubt as
to its being the business of the artist to see to it that his
talent be so developed, that he <a name='Page_18' id=
"Page_18"></a><span class='pagenum'>18</span>may prove a fit
instrument for the expression of whatever it may be given him to
express; while it must be left to his individual temperament to
decide how far it is advisable to pursue any intellectual analysis
of the elusive things that are the true matter of art.</p>
<p>Provided the student realises this, and that art training can
only deal with the perfecting of a means of expression and that the
real matter of art lies above this and is beyond the scope of
teaching, he cannot have too much of it. For although he must ever
be a child before the influence that moves him, if it is not with
the knowledge of the grown man that he takes off his coat and
approaches the craft of painting or drawing, he will be poorly
equipped to make them a means of conveying to others in adequate
form the things he may wish to express. Great things are only done
in art when the creative instinct of the artist has a
well-organised executive faculty at its disposal.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Of the two divisions into which the technical study of painting
can be divided, namely Form and Colour, we are concerned in this
book with Form alone. But before proceeding to our immediate
subject something should be said as to the nature of art generally,
not with the ambition of arriving at any final result in a short
chapter, but merely in order to give an idea of the point of view
from which the following pages are written, so that
misunderstandings may be avoided.</p>
<p>The variety of definitions that exist justifies some inquiry.
The following are a few that come to mind:</p>
<p class='blockquote'>"Art is nature expressed through a
personality."</p>
<p><a name='Page_19' id="Page_19"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>19</span>But what of architecture? Or music? Then there
is Morris's</p>
<div class='blockquote'>
<p>"Art is the expression of pleasure in work."</p>
</div>
<p>But this does not apply to music and poetry. Andrew Lang's</p>
<div class='blockquote'>
<p>"Everything which we distinguish from nature"</p>
</div>
<p>seems too broad to catch hold of, while Tolstoy's</p>
<div class='blockquote'>
<p>"An action by means of which one man, having experienced a
feeling, intentionally transmits it to others"</p>
</div>
<p>is nearer the truth, and covers all the arts, but seems, from
its omitting any mention of <b>rhythm</b>, very inadequate.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Now the facts of life are conveyed by our senses to the
consciousness within us, and stimulate the world of thought and
feeling that constitutes our real life. Thought and feeling are
very intimately connected, few of our mental perceptions,
particularly when they first dawn upon us, being unaccompanied by
some feeling. But there is this general division to be made, on one
extreme of which is what we call pure intellect, and on the other
pure feeling or emotion. The arts, I take it, are a means of giving
expression to the emotional side of this mental activity,
intimately related as it often is to the more purely intellectual
side. The more sensual side of this feeling is perhaps its lowest,
while the feelings associated with the intelligence, the little
sensitivenesses of perception that escape pure intellect, are
possibly its noblest experiences.</p>
<p>Pure intellect seeks to construct from the facts brought to our
consciousness by the senses, an accurately <a name='Page_20' id=
"Page_20"></a><span class='pagenum'>20</span>measured world of
phenomena, uncoloured by the human equation in each of us. It seeks
to create a point of view outside the human standpoint, one more
stable and accurate, unaffected by the ever-changing current of
human life. It therefore invents mechanical instruments to do the
measuring of our sense perceptions, as their records are more
accurate than human observation unaided.</p>
<p>But while in science observation is made much more effective by
the use of mechanical instruments in registering facts, the facts
with which art deals, being those of feeling, can only be recorded
by the feeling instrument&mdash;man, and are entirely missed by any
mechanically devised substitutes.</p>
<p>The artistic intelligence is not interested in things from this
standpoint of mechanical accuracy, but in the effect of observation
on the living consciousness&mdash;the sentient individual in each
of us. The same fact accurately portrayed by a number of artistic
intelligences should be different in each case, whereas the same
fact accurately expressed by a number of scientific intelligences
should be the same.</p>
<p>But besides the feelings connected with a wide range of
experience, each art has certain emotions belonging to the
particular sense perceptions connected with it. That is to say,
there are some that only music can convey: those connected with
sound; others that only painting, sculpture, or architecture can
convey: those connected with the form and colour that they
severally deal with.</p>
<p>In abstract form and colour&mdash;that is, form and colour
unconnected with natural appearances&mdash;there is an emotional
power, such as there is in music, the sounds of which have no
direct connection with <a name='Page_21' id=
"Page_21"></a><span class='pagenum'>21</span>anything in nature,
but only with that mysterious sense we have, the sense of Harmony,
Beauty, or Rhythm (all three but different aspects of the same
thing).</p>
<p>This inner sense is a very remarkable fact, and will be found to
some extent in all, certainly all civilised, races. And when the
art of a remote people like the Chinese and Japanese is understood,
our senses of harmony are found to be wonderfully in agreement.
Despite the fact that their art has developed on lines widely
different from our own, none the less, when the surprise at its
newness has worn off and we begin to understand it, we find it
conforms to very much the same sense of harmony.</p>
<p>But apart from the feelings connected directly with the means of
expression, there appears to be much in common between all the arts
in their most profound expression; there seems to be a common
centre in our inner life that they all appeal to. Possibly at this
centre are the great primitive emotions common to all men. The
religious group, the deep awe and reverence men feel when
contemplating the great mystery of the Universe and their own
littleness in the face of its vastness&mdash;the desire to
correspond and develop relationship with the something outside
themselves that is felt to be behind and through all things. Then
there are those connected with the joy of life, the throbbing of
the great life spirit, the gladness of being, the desire of the
sexes; and also those connected with the sadness and mystery of
death and decay, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The technical side of an art is, however, not concerned with
these deeper motives but with the <a name='Page_22' id=
"Page_22"></a><span class='pagenum'>22</span>things of sense
through which they find expression; in the case of painting, the
visible universe.</p>
<p>The artist is capable of being stimulated to artistic expression
by all things seen, no matter what; to him nothing comes amiss.
Great pictures have been made of beautiful people in beautiful
clothes and of squalid people in ugly clothes, of beautiful
architectural buildings and the ugly hovels of the poor. And the
same painter who painted the Alps painted the Great Western
Railway.</p>
<p>The visible world is to the artist, as it were, a wonderful
garment, at times revealing to him the Beyond, the Inner Truth
there is in all things. He has a consciousness of some
correspondence with something the other side of visible things and
dimly felt through them, a "still, small voice" which he is
impelled to interpret to man. It is the expression of this
all-pervading inner significance that I think we recognise as
beauty, and that prompted Keats to say:</p>
<div class='blockquote'>
<p>"Beauty is truth, truth beauty."</p>
</div>
<p>And hence it is that the love of truth and the love of beauty
can exist together in the work of the artist. The search for this
inner truth is the search for beauty. People whose vision does not
penetrate beyond the narrow limits of the commonplace, and to whom
a cabbage is but a vulgar vegetable, are surprised if they see a
beautiful picture painted of one, and say that the artist has
idealised it, meaning that he has consciously altered its
appearance on some idealistic formula; whereas he has probably only
honestly given expression to a truer, deeper vision than they had
been aware of. The commonplace is not the true, but only the
shallow, view of things.</p>

<p>Fromentin's</p>
<div class='blockquote'>
<p>"Art is the expression of the invisible by means of the
visible"</p>
</div>
<p>expresses the same idea, and it is this that gives to art its
high place among the works of man.</p>
<p>Beautiful things seem to put us in correspondence with a world
the harmonies of which are more perfect, and bring a deeper peace
than this imperfect life seems capable of yielding of itself. Our
moments of peace are, I think, always associated with some form of
beauty, of this spark of harmony within corresponding with some
infinite source without. Like a mariner's compass, we are restless
until we find repose in this one direction. In moments of beauty
(for beauty is, strictly speaking, a state of mind rather than an
attribute of certain objects, although certain things have the
power of inducing it more than others) we seem to get a glimpse of
this deeper truth behind the things of sense. And who can say but
that this sense, dull enough in most of us, is not an echo of a
greater harmony existing somewhere the other side of things, that
we dimly feel through them, evasive though it is.</p>
<p>But we must tread lightly in these rarefied regions and get on
to more practical concerns. By finding and emphasising in his work
those elements in visual appearances that express these profounder
things, the painter is enabled to stimulate the perception of them
in others.</p>
<p>In the representation of a fine mountain, for instance, there
are, besides all its rhythmic beauty of form and colour,
associations touching deeper chords in our
natures&mdash;associations connected with its size, age, and
permanence, &amp;c.; at any rate we have more feelings than form
and colour of themselves <a name='Page_24' id=
"Page_24"></a><span class='pagenum'>24</span>are capable of
arousing. And these things must be felt by the painter, and his
picture painted under the influence of these feelings, if he is
instinctively to select those elements of form and colour that
convey them. Such deeper feelings are far too intimately associated
even with the finer beauties of mere form and colour for the
painter to be able to neglect them; no amount of technical
knowledge will take the place of feeling, or direct the painter so
surely in his selection of what is fine.</p>
<p>There are those who would say, "This is all very well, but the
painter's concern is with form and colour and paint, and nothing
else. If he paints the mountain faithfully from that point of view,
it will suggest all these other associations to those who want
them." And others who would say that the form and colour of
appearances are only to be used as a language to give expression to
the feelings common to all men. "Art for art's sake" and "Art for
subject's sake." There are these two extreme positions to consider,
and it will depend on the individual on which side his work lies.
His interest will be more on the aesthetic side, in the feelings
directly concerned with form and colour; or on the side of the
mental associations connected with appearances, according to his
temperament. But neither position can neglect the other without
fatal loss. The picture of form and colour will never be able to
escape the associations connected with visual things, neither will
the picture all for subject be able to get away from its form and
colour. And it is wrong to say "If he paints the mountain
faithfully from the form and colour point of view it will suggest
all those other associations to those who want them," unless, as is
possible with a simple-minded painter, he <a name='Page_25' id=
"Page_25"></a><span class='pagenum'>25</span>be unconsciously moved
by deeper feelings, and impelled to select the significant things
while only conscious of his paint. But the chances are that his
picture will convey the things he was thinking about, and, in
consequence, instead of impressing us with the grandeur of the
mountain, will say something very like "See what a clever painter I
am!" Unless the artist has painted his picture under the influence
of the deeper feelings the scene was capable of producing, it is
not likely anybody will be so impressed when they look at his
work.</p>
<p>And the painter deeply moved with high ideals as to subject
matter, who neglects the form and colour through which he is
expressing them, will find that his work has failed to be
convincing. The immaterial can only be expressed through the
material in art, and the painted symbols of the picture must be
very perfect if subtle and elusive meanings are to be conveyed. If
he cannot paint the commonplace aspect of our mountain, how can he
expect to paint any expression of the deeper things in it? The fact
is, both positions are incomplete. In all good art the matter
expressed and the manner of its expression are so intimate as to
have become one. The deeper associations connected with the
mountain are only matters for art in so far as they affect its
appearance and take shape as form and colour in the mind of the
artist, informing the whole process of the painting, even to the
brush strokes. As in a good poem, it is impossible to consider the
poetic idea apart from the words that express it: they are fired
together at its creation.</p>
<p>Now an expression by means of one of our different sense
perceptions does not constitute art, or <a name='Page_26' id=
"Page_26"></a><span class='pagenum'>26</span>the boy shouting at
the top of his voice, giving expression to his delight in life but
making a horrible noise, would be an artist. If his expression is
to be adequate to convey his feeling to others, there must be some
arrangement. The expression must be ordered, rhythmic, or whatever
word most fitly conveys the idea of those powers, conscious or
unconscious, that select and arrange the sensuous material of art,
so as to make the most telling impression, by bringing it into
relation with our innate sense of harmony. If we can find a rough
definition that will include all the arts, it will help us to see
in what direction lie those things in painting that make it an art.
The not uncommon idea, that painting is "the production by means of
colours of more or less perfect representations of natural objects"
will not do. And it is devoutly to be hoped that science will
perfect a method of colour photography finally to dispel this
illusion.</p>
<p>What, then, will serve as a working definition? There must be
something about feeling, the expression of that individuality the
secret of which everyone carries in himself; the expression of that
ego that perceives and is moved by the phenomena of life around us.
And, on the other hand, something about the ordering of its
expression.</p>
<p>But who knows of words that can convey a just idea of such
subtle matter? If one says "Art is the rhythmic expression of Life,
or emotional consciousness, or feeling," all are inadequate.
Perhaps the "rhythmic expression of life" would be the more perfect
definition. But the word "life" is so much more associated with
eating and drinking in the popular mind, than with the spirit or
force or whatever you care to call it, that exists behind
consciousness <a name='Page_27' id="Page_27"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>27</span> and is the animating factor of our whole being,
that it will hardly serve a useful purpose. So that, perhaps, for a
rough, practical definition that will at least point away from the
mechanical performances that so often pass for art, "<b>the
Rhythmic expression of Feeling</b>" will do: for by Rhythm is meant
that ordering of the materials of art (form and colour, in the case
of painting) so as to bring them into relationship with our innate
sense of harmony which gives them their expressive power. Without
this relationship we have no direct means of making the sensuous
material of art awaken an answering echo in others. The boy
shouting at the top of his voice, making a horrible noise, was not
an artist because his expression was inadequate&mdash;was not
related to the underlying sense of harmony that would have given it
expressive power.</p>

title="" /></a>
<p>Plate III.</p>
<p>STUDY FOR "APRIL"</p>
<p>In red chalk on toned paper.</p>
</div>
<p>Let us test this definition with some simple cases. Here is a
savage, shouting and flinging his arms and legs about in wild
delight; he is not an artist, although he may be moved by life and
feeling. But let this shouting be done on some ordered plan, to a
rhythm expressive of joy and delight, and his leg and arm movements
governed by it also, and he has become an artist, and singing and
dancing (possibly the oldest of the arts) will result.</p>
<p>Or take the case of one who has been deeply moved by something
he has seen, say a man killed by a wild beast, which he wishes to
tell his friends. If he just explains the facts as he saw them,
making no effort to order his words so as to make the most telling
impression upon his hearers and convey to them something of the
feelings that are stirring in him, if he merely does this, he is
not an artist, although the recital of such a terrible incident may
be <a name='Page_28' id="Page_28"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>28</span>moving. But the moment he arranges his words so
as to convey in a telling manner not only the plain facts, but the
horrible feelings he experienced at the sight, he has become an
artist. And if he further orders his words to a rhythmic beat, a
beat in sympathy with his subject, he has become still more
artistic, and a primitive form of poetry will result.</p>
<p>Or in building a hut, so long as a man is interested solely in
the utilitarian side of the matter, as are so many builders to-day,
and just puts up walls as he needs protection from wild beasts, and
a roof to keep out the rain, he is not yet an artist. But the
moment he begins to consider his work with some feeling, and
arranges the relative sizes of his walls and roof so that they
answer to some sense he has for beautiful proportion, he has become
an artist, and his hut has some architectural pretensions. Now if
his hut is of wood, and he paints it to protect it from the
elements, nothing necessarily artistic has been done. But if he
selects colours that give him pleasure in their arrangement, and if
the forms his colour masses assume are designed with some personal
feeling, he has invented a primitive form of decoration.</p>
<p>And likewise the savage who, wishing to illustrate his
description of a strange animal he has seen, takes a piece of burnt
wood and draws on the wall his idea of what it looked like, a sort
of catalogue of its appearance in its details, he is not
necessarily an artist. It is only when he draws under the influence
of some feeling, of some pleasure he felt in the appearance of the
animal, that he becomes an artist.</p>
<p>Of course in each case it is assumed that the men have the power
to be moved by these things, and whether they are good or poor
artists will <a name='Page_29' id="Page_29"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>29</span>depend on the quality of their feeling and the
fitness of its expression.</p>

</div>
<p>The purest form of this "rhythmic expression of feeling" is
music. And as Walter Pater shows us in his essay on "The School of
Giorgione," "music is the type of art." The others are more
artistic as they approach its conditions. Poetry, the most musical
form of literature, is its most artistic form. And in the greatest
pictures form, colour, and idea are united to thrill us with
harmonies analogous to music.</p>
<p>The painter expresses his feelings through the representation of
the visible world of Nature, and through the representation of
those combinations of form and colour inspired in his imagination,
that were all originally derived from visible nature. If he fails
from lack of skill to make his representation convincing to
reasonable people, no matter how sublime has been his artistic
intention, he will probably have landed in the ridiculous. And yet,
<b>so great is the power of direction exercised by the emotions on
the artist that it is seldom his work fails to convey something,
when genuine feeling has been the motive</b>. On the other hand,
the painter with no artistic impulse who makes a laboriously
commonplace picture of some ordinary or pretentious subject, has
equally failed as an artist, however much the skilfulness of his
representations may gain him reputation with the unthinking.</p>
<p>The study, therefore, of the <b>representation of visible
nature</b> and of <b>the powers of expression possessed by form and
colour</b> is the object of the painter's training.</p>
<p>And a command over this power of representation and expression
is absolutely necessary if he is to be capable of doing anything
worthy of his art.</p>
<p><a name='Page_30' id="Page_30"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>30</span>This is all in art that one can attempt to
teach. The emotional side is beyond the scope of teaching. You
cannot teach people how to feel. All you can do is to surround them
with the conditions calculated to stimulate any natural feeling
they may possess. And this is done by familiarising students with
the best works of art and nature.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>It is surprising how few art students have any idea of what it
is that constitutes art. They are impelled, it is to be assumed, by
a natural desire to express themselves by painting, and, if their
intuitive ability is strong enough, it perhaps matters little
whether they know or not. But to the larger number who are not so
violently impelled, it is highly essential that they have some
better idea of art than that it consists in setting down your
canvas before nature and copying it.</p>
<p>Inadequate as this imperfect treatment of a profoundly
interesting subject is, it may serve to give some idea of the point
of view from which the following pages are written, and if it also
serves to disturb the "copying theory" in the minds of any students
and encourages them to make further inquiry, it will have served a
useful purpose.</p>

<h2>II<br />
DRAWING</h2>
<p>By drawing is here meant <b>the expression of form upon a plane
surface</b>.</p>
<p>Art probably owes more to form for its range of expression than
to colour. Many of the noblest things it is capable of conveying
are expressed by form more directly than by anything else. And it
is interesting to notice how some of the world's greatest artists
have been very restricted in their use of colour, preferring to
depend on form for their chief appeal. It is reported that Apelles
only used three colours, black, red, and yellow, and Rembrandt used
little else. Drawing, although the first, is also the last, thing
the painter usually studies. There is more in it that can be taught
and that repays constant application and effort. Colour would seem
to depend much more on a natural sense and to be less amenable to
teaching. A well-trained eye for the appreciation of form is what
every student should set himself to acquire with all the might of
which he is capable.</p>
<p>It is not enough in artistic drawing to portray accurately and
in cold blood the appearance of objects. To express form one must
first be moved by it. There is in the appearance of all objects,
animate and inanimate, what has been called an <b>emotional
significance</b>, a hidden rhythm that is not <a name='Page_32' id=
"Page_32"></a><span class='pagenum'>32</span>caught by the
accurate, painstaking, but cold artist. The form significance of
which we speak is never found in a mechanical reproduction like a
photograph. You are never moved to say when looking at one, "What
fine form."</p>
<p>It is difficult to say in what this quality consists. The
emphasis and selection that is unconsciously given in a drawing
done directly under the guidance of strong feeling, are too subtle
to be tabulated; they escape analysis. But it is this selection of
the significant and suppression of the non-essential that often
gives to a few lines drawn quickly, and having a somewhat remote
relation to the complex appearance of the real object, more
vitality and truth than are to be found in a highly-wrought and
painstaking drawing, during the process of which the essential and
vital things have been lost sight of in the labour of the work; and
the non-essential, which is usually more obvious, is allowed to
creep in and obscure the original impression. Of course, had the
finished drawing been done with the mind centred upon the
particular form significance aimed at, and every touch and detail
added in tune to this idea, the comparison might have been
different. But it is rarely that good drawings are done this way.
Fine things seem only to be seen in flashes, and the nature that
can carry over the impression of one of these moments during the
labour of a highly-wrought drawing is very rare, and belongs to the
few great ones of the craft alone.</p>
<p>It is difficult to know why one should be moved by the
expression of form; but it appears to have some physical influence
over us. In looking at a fine drawing, say of a strong man, we seem
to identify ourselves with it and feel a thrill of its strength in
<a name='Page_33' id="Page_33"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>33</span>our own bodies, prompting us to set our teeth,
stiffen our frame, and exclaim "That's fine." Or, when looking at
the drawing of a beautiful woman, we are softened by its charm and
feel in ourselves something of its sweetness as we exclaim, "How
beautiful." The measure of the feeling in either case will be the
extent to which the artist has identified himself with the subject
when making the drawing, and has been impelled to select the
expressive elements in the forms.</p>
<p>Art thus enables us to experience life at second hand. The small
man may enjoy somewhat of the wider experience of the bigger man,
and be educated to appreciate in time a wider experience for
himself. This is the true justification for public picture
galleries. Not so much for the moral influence they exert, of which
we have heard so much, but that people may be led through the
vision of the artist to enlarge their experience of life. This
enlarging of the experience is true education, and a very different
thing from the memorising of facts that so often passes as such. In
a way this may be said to be a moral influence, as a larger mind is
less likely to harbour small meannesses. But this is not the kind
of moral influence usually looked for by the many, who rather
demand a moral story told by the picture; a thing not always
suitable to artistic expression.</p>
<p>One is always profoundly impressed by the expression of a sense
of bulk, vastness, or mass in form. There is a feeling of being
lifted out of one's puny self to something bigger and more stable.
It is this splendid feeling of bigness in Michael Angelo's figures
that is so satisfying. One cannot come away from the contemplation
of that wonderful ceiling of <a name='Page_34' id=
"Page_34"></a><span class='pagenum'>34</span>his in the Vatican
without the sense of having experienced something of a larger life
than one had known before. Never has the dignity of man reached so
high an expression in paint, a height that has been the despair of
all who have since tried to follow that lonely master. In landscape
also this expression of largeness is fine: one likes to feel the
weight and mass of the ground, the vastness of the sky and sea, the
bulk of a mountain.</p>
<p>On the other hand one is charmed also by the expression of
lightness. This may be noted in much of the work of Botticelli and
the Italians of the fifteenth century. Botticelli's figures seldom
have any weight; they drift about as if walking on air, giving a
delightful feeling of otherworldliness. The hands of the Madonna
that hold the Child might be holding flowers for any sense of
support they express. It is, I think, on this sense of lightness
that a great deal of the exquisite charm of Botticelli's drawing
depends.</p>
<p>The feathery lightness of clouds and of draperies blown by the
wind is always pleasing, and Botticelli nearly always has a light
wind passing through his draperies to give them this sense.</p>
<p>As will be explained later, in connection with academic drawing,
it is eminently necessary for the student to train his eye
accurately to observe the forms of things by the most painstaking
of drawings. In these school studies feeling need not be
considered, but only a cold accuracy. In the same way a singer
trains himself to sing scales, giving every note exactly the same
weight and preserving a most mechanical time throughout, so that
every note of his voice may be accurately under his control and be
equal to the subtlest variations he may afterwards <a name=
'Page_35' id="Page_35"></a><span class='pagenum'>35</span>want to
infuse into it at the dictates of feeling. For how can the
draughtsman, who does not know how to draw accurately the cold,
commonplace view of an object, hope to give expression to the
subtle differences presented by the same thing seen under the
excitement of strong feeling?</p>

</div>
<p>These academic drawings, too, should be as highly finished as
hard application can make them, so that the habit of minute visual
expression may be acquired. It will be needed later, when drawing
of a finer kind is attempted, and when in the heat of an emotional
stimulus the artist has no time to consider the smaller subtleties
of drawing, which by then should have become almost instinctive
with him, leaving his mind free to dwell on the bigger
qualities.</p>
<p>Drawing, then, to be worthy of the name, must be more than what
is called accurate. It must present the form of things in a more
vivid manner than we ordinarily see them in nature. Every new
draughtsman in the history of art has discovered a new significance
in the form of common things, and given the world a new experience.
He has represented these qualities under the stimulus of the
feeling they inspired in him, hot and underlined, as it were,
adding to the great book of sight the world possesses in its art, a
book by no means completed yet.</p>
<p>So that to say of a drawing, as is so often said, that it is not
true because it does not present the commonplace appearance of an
object accurately, may be foolish. Its accuracy depends on the
completeness with which it conveys the particular emotional
significance that is the object of the drawing. What this
significance is will vary <a name='Page_36' id=
"Page_36"></a><span class='pagenum'>36</span>enormously with the
individual artist, but it is only by this standard that the
accuracy of the drawing can be judged.</p>
<p>It is this difference between scientific accuracy and artistic
accuracy that puzzles so many people. Science demands that
phenomena be observed with the unemotional accuracy of a weighing
machine, while artistic accuracy demands that things be observed by
a sentient individual recording the sensations produced in him by
the phenomena of life. And people with the scientific habit that is
now so common among us, seeing a picture or drawing in which what
are called facts have been expressed emotionally, are puzzled, if
they are modest, or laugh at what they consider a glaring mistake
in drawing if they are not, when all the time it may be their
mistaken point of view that is at fault.</p>
<p>But while there is no absolute artistic standard by which
accuracy of drawing can be judged, as such standard must
necessarily vary with the artistic intention of each individual
artist, this fact must not be taken as an excuse for any obviously
faulty drawing that incompetence may produce, as is often done by
students who when corrected say that they "saw it so." For there
undoubtedly exists a rough physical standard of rightness in
drawing, any violent deviations from which, even at the dictates of
emotional expression, is productive of the grotesque. This physical
standard of accuracy in his work it is the business of the student
to acquire in his academic training; and every aid that science can
give by such studies as Perspective, Anatomy, and, in the case of
Landscape, even Geology and Botany, should be used to increase the
accuracy of <a name='Page_37' id="Page_37"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>37</span>his representations. For the strength of appeal
in artistic work will depend much on the power the artist possesses
of expressing himself through representations that arrest everyone
by their truth and naturalness. And although, when truth and
naturalness exist without any artistic expression, the result is of
little account as art, on the other hand, when truly artistic
expression is clothed in representations that offend our ideas of
physical truth, it is only the few who can forgive the offence for
the sake of the genuine feeling they perceive behind it.</p>

</div>
<p>How far the necessities of expression may be allowed to override
the dictates of truth to physical structure in the appearance of
objects will always be a much debated point. In the best drawing
the departures from mechanical accuracy are so subtle that I have
no doubt many will deny the existence of such a thing altogether.
Good artists of strong natural inspiration and simple minds are
often quite unconscious of doing anything when painting, but are
all the same as mechanically accurate as possible.</p>
<p>Yet however much it may be advisable to let yourself go in
artistic work, during your academic training let your aim be <b>a
searching accuracy</b>.</p>

<h2>III<br />
VISION</h2>
<p>It is necessary to say something about Vision in the first
place, if we are to have any grasp of the idea of form.</p>
<p>An act of vision is not so simple a matter as the student who
asked her master if she should "paint nature as she saw nature"
would seem to have thought. And his answer, "Yes, madam, provided
you don't see nature as you paint nature," expressed the first
difficulty the student of painting has to face: the difficulty of
learning to see.</p>
<p>Let us roughly examine what we know of vision. Science tells us
that all objects are made visible to us by means of light; and that
white light, by which we see things in what may be called their
normal aspect, is composed of all the colours of the solar
spectrum, as may be seen in a rainbow; a phenomenon caused, as
everybody knows, by the sun's rays being split up into their
component parts.</p>
<p>This light travels in straight lines and, striking objects
before us, is reflected in all directions. Some of these rays
passing through a point situated behind the lenses of the eye,
strike the retina. The multiplication of these rays on the retina
produces a picture of whatever is before the eye, such as can be
seen on the ground glass at the back of a <a name='Page_39' id=
"Page_39"></a><span class='pagenum'>39</span>photographer's camera,
or on the table of a camera obscura, both of which instruments are
constructed roughly on the same principle as the human eye.</p>
<p>These rays of light when reflected from an object, and again
when passing through the atmosphere, undergo certain modifications.
Should the object be a red one, the yellow, green, and blue rays,
all, in fact, except the red rays, are absorbed by the object,
while the red is allowed to escape. These red rays striking the
retina produce certain effects which convey to our consciousness
the sensation of red, and we say "That is a red object." But there
may be particles of moisture or dust in the air that will modify
the red rays so that by the time they reach the eye they may be
somewhat different. This modification is naturally most effective
when a large amount of atmosphere has to be passed through, and in
things very distant the colour of the natural object is often
entirely lost, to be replaced by atmospheric colours, as we see in
distant mountains when the air is not perfectly clear. But we must
not stray into the fascinating province of colour.</p>
<p>What chiefly concerns us here is the fact that the pictures on
our retinas are flat, of two dimensions, the same as the canvas on
which we paint. If you examine these visual pictures without any
prejudice, as one may with a camera obscura, you will see that they
are composed of masses of colour in infinite variety and
complexity, of different shapes and gradations, and with many
varieties of edges; giving to the eye the illusion of nature with
actual depths and distances, although one knows all the time that
it is a flat table on which one is looking.</p>
<p>Seeing then that our eyes have only flat pictures containing
two-dimension information about the <a name='Page_40' id=
"Page_40"></a><span class='pagenum'>40</span>objective world, from
whence is this knowledge of distance and the solidity of things?
How do we <i>see</i> the third dimension, the depth and thickness,
by means of flat pictures of two dimensions?</p>
<p>The power to judge distance is due principally to our possessing
two eyes situated in slightly different positions, from which we
get two views of objects, and also to the power possessed by the
eyes of focussing at different distances, others being out of focus
for the time being. In a picture the eyes can only focus at one
distance (the distance the eye is from the plane of the picture
when you are looking at it), and this is one of the chief causes of
the perennial difficulty in painting backgrounds. In nature they
are out of focus when one is looking at an object, but in a
painting the background is necessarily on the same focal plane as
the object. Numerous are the devices resorted to by painters to
overcome this difficulty, but they do not concern us here.</p>
<p>The fact that we have two flat pictures on our two retinas to
help us, and that we can focus at different planes, would not
suffice to account for our knowledge of the solidity and shape of
the objective world, were these senses not associated with another
sense all important in ideas of form, <b>the sense of
touch</b>.</p>
<p>This sense is very highly developed in us, and the earlier
period of our existence is largely given over to feeling for the
objective world outside ourselves. Who has not watched the little
baby hands feeling for everything within reach, and without its
reach, for the matter of that; for the infant has no knowledge yet
of what is and what is not within its reach. Who has not offered
some bright object to a <a name='Page_41' id=
"Page_41"></a><span class='pagenum'>41</span>young child and
watched its clumsy attempts to feel for it, almost as clumsy at
first as if it were blind, as it has not yet learned to focus
distances. And when he has at last got hold of it, how eagerly he
feels it all over, looking intently at it all the time; thus
learning early to associate the "feel of an object" with its
appearance. In this way by degrees he acquires those ideas of
roughness and smoothness, hardness and softness, solidity, &amp;c.,
which later on he will be able to distinguish by vision alone, and
without touching the object.</p>
<p>Our survival depends so much on this sense of touch, that it is
of the first importance to us. We must know whether the ground is
hard enough for us to walk on, or whether there is a hole in front
of us; and masses of colour rays striking the retina, which is what
vision amounts to, will not of themselves tell us. But associated
with the knowledge accumulated in our early years, by connecting
touch with sight, we do know when certain combinations of colour
rays strike the eye that there is a road for us to walk on, and
that when certain other combinations occur there is a hole in front
of us, or the edge of a precipice.</p>
<p>And likewise with hardness and softness, the child who strikes
his head against the bed-post is forcibly reminded by nature that
such things are to be avoided, and feeling that it is hard and that
hardness has a certain look, it avoids that kind of thing in the
future. And when it strikes its head against the pillow, it learns
the nature of softness, and associating this sensation with the
appearance of the pillow, knows in future that when softness is
observed it need not be avoided as hardness must be.</p>
<p><a name='Page_42' id="Page_42"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>42</span>Sight is therefore not a matter of the eye
alone. A whole train of associations connected with the objective
world is set going in the mind when rays of light strike the retina
refracted from objects. And these associations vary enormously in
quantity and value with different individuals; but the one we are
here chiefly concerned with is this universal one of touch.
Everybody "sees" the shape of an object, and "sees" whether it
"looks" hard or soft, &amp;c. Sees, in other words, the "feel" of
it.</p>
<p>If you are asked to think of an object, say a cone, it will not,
I think, be the visual aspect that will occur to most people. They
will think of a circular base from which a continuous side slopes
up to a point situated above its centre, as one would feel it. The
fact that in almost every visual aspect the base line is that of an
ellipse, not a circle, comes as a surprise to people unaccustomed
to drawing.</p>
<p>But above these cruder instances, what a wealth of associations
crowd in upon the mind, when a sight that moves one is observed.
Put two men before a scene, one an ordinary person and the other a
great poet, and ask them to describe what they see. Assuming them
both to be possessed of a reasonable power honestly to express
themselves, what a difference would there be in the value of their
descriptions. Or take two painters both equally gifted in the power
of expressing their visual perceptions, and put them before the
scene to paint it. And assuming one to be a commonplace man and the
other a great artist, what a difference will there be in their
work. The commonplace painter will paint a commonplace picture,
while the form and colour will be the means of stirring deep
associations <a name='Page_43' id="Page_43"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>43</span>and feelings in the mind of the other, and will
move him to paint the scene so that the same splendour of
associations may be conveyed to the beholder.</p>

</div>
<p>But to return to our infant mind. While the development of the
perception of things has been going on, the purely visual side of
the question, the observation of the picture on the retina for what
it is as form and colour, has been neglected&mdash;neglected to
such an extent that when the child comes to attempt drawing,
<b>sight is not the sense he consults</b>. The mental idea of the
objective world that has grown up in his mind is now associated
more directly with touch than with sight, with the felt shape
rather than the visual appearance. So that if he is asked to draw a
head, he thinks of it first as an object having a continuous
boundary in space. This his mind instinctively conceives as a line.
Then, hair he expresses by a row of little lines coming out from
the boundary, all round the top. He thinks of eyes as two points or
circles, or as points in circles, and the nose either as a triangle
or an L-shaped line. If you feel the nose you will see the reason
of this. Down the front you have the L line, and if you feel round
it you will find the two sides meeting at the top and a base
joining them, suggesting the triangle. The mouth similarly is an
opening with a row of teeth, which are generally shown although so
seldom seen, but always apparent if the mouth is felt (see diagram
A). This is, I think, a fair type of the first drawing the ordinary
child makes&mdash;and judging by some ancient scribbling of the
same order I remember noticing scratched on a wall at Pompeii, and
by savage drawing generally, it appears to be a fairly universal
<a name='Page_44' id="Page_44"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>44</span>type. It is a very remarkable thing which, as
far as I know, has not yet been pointed out, that in these first
attempts at drawing the vision should not be consulted. A blind man
would not draw differently, could he but see to draw. Were vision
the first sense consulted, and were the simplest visual appearance
sought after, one might expect something like diagram B, the
shadows under eyes, nose, mouth, and chin, with the darker mass of
the hair being the simplest thing the visual appearance can be
reduced to. But despite this being quite as easy to do, it does not
appeal to the ordinary child as the other type does, because it
does not satisfy the <a name='Page_45' id=
"Page_45"></a><span class='pagenum'>45</span>sense of touch that
forms so large a part of the idea of an object in the mind. All
architectural elevations and geometrical projections generally
appeal to this mental idea of form. They consist of views of a
building or object that could never possibly be seen by anybody,
assuming as they do that the eye of the spectator is exactly in
front of every part of the building at the same time, a physical
impossibility. And yet so removed from the actual visual appearance
is our mental idea of objects that such drawings do convey a very
accurate idea of a building or object. And of course they have
great advantage as working drawings in that they can be scaled.</p>

<p>B. TYPE OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IF CRUDEST EXPRESSION

</div>
<p>If so early the sense of vision is neglected and relegated to be
the handmaiden of other senses, it is no wonder that in the average
adult it is in such a shocking state of neglect. I feel convinced
that with the great majority of people vision is seldom if ever
consulted for itself, but only to minister to some other sense.
They look at the sky to see if it is going to be fine; at the
fields to see if they are dry enough to walk on, or whether there
will be a good crop of hay; at the stream not to observe the beauty
of the reflections from the blue sky or green fields dancing upon
its surface or the rich colouring of its shadowed depths, but to
calculate how deep it is or how much power it would supply to work
a mill, how many fish it contains, or some other association alien
to its visual aspect. If one looks up at a fine mass of cumulus
clouds above a London street, the ordinary passer-by who follows
one's gaze expects to see a balloon or a flying-machine at least,
and when he sees it is only clouds he is apt to wonder what one is
gazing at. The beautiful <a name='Page_46' id=
"Page_46"></a><span class='pagenum'>46</span>form and colour of the
cloud seem to be unobserved. Clouds mean nothing to him but an
accumulation of water dust that may bring rain. This accounts in
some way for the number of good paintings that are incomprehensible
to the majority of people. It is only those pictures that pursue
the visual aspect of objects to a sufficient completion to contain
the suggestion of these other associations, that they understand at
all. Other pictures, they say, are not finished enough. And it is
so seldom that a picture can have this petty realisation and at the
same time be an expression of those larger emotional qualities that
constitute good painting.</p>
<p>The early paintings of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood appear to
be a striking exception to this. But in their work the excessive
realisation of all details was part of the expression and gave
emphasis to the poetic idea at the basis of their pictures, and was
therefore part of the artistic intention. In these paintings the
fiery intensity with which every little detail was painted made
their picture a ready medium for the expression of poetic thought,
a sort of "painted poetry," every detail being selected on account
of some symbolic meaning it had, bearing on the poetic idea that
was the object of the picture.</p>
<p>But to those painters who do not attempt "painted poetry," but
seek in painting a poetry of its own, a visual poetry, this
excessive finish (as it is called) is irksome, as it mars the
expression of those qualities in vision they wish to express.
Finish in art has no connection with the amount of detail in a
picture, but has reference only to the completeness with which the
emotional idea the painter set out to express has been
realised.</p>

<p><a name='Page_47' id="Page_47"></a><span class=

is greatly to be deplored, as nature is ever offering them on their
retina, even in the meanest slum, a music of colour and form that
is a constant source of pleasure to those who can see it. But so
many are content to use this wonderful faculty of vision for
utilitarian purposes only. It is the privilege of the artist to
show how wonderful and beautiful is all this music of colour and
form, so that people, having been moved by it in his work, may be
encouraged to see the same beauty in the things around them. This
is the best argument in favour of making art a subject of general
education: that it should teach people to see. Everybody does not
need to draw and paint, but if everybody could get the faculty of
appreciating the form and colour on their retinas as form and
colour, what a wealth would always be at their disposal for
enjoyment! The Japanese habit of looking at a landscape upside down
between their legs is a way of seeing without the deadening
influence of touch associations. Thus looking, one is surprised
into seeing for once the colour and form of things with the
association of touch for the moment forgotten, and is puzzled at
the beauty. The odd thing is that although thus we see things
upside down, the pictures on our retinas are for once the right way
up; for ordinarily the visual picture is inverted on the retina,
like that on the ground glass at the back of a photographic
camera.</p>
<p>To sum up this somewhat rambling chapter, I have endeavoured to
show that there are two aspects from which the objective world can
be apprehended. There is the purely mental perception founded
chiefly on knowledge derived from our sense <a name='Page_48' id=
"Page_48"></a><span class='pagenum'>48</span>of touch associated
with vision, whose primitive instinct is to put an outline round
objects as representing their boundaries in space. And secondly,
there is the visual perception, which is concerned with the visual
aspects of objects as they appear on the retina; an arrangement of
colour shapes, a sort of mosaic of colour. And these two aspects
give us two different points of view from which the representation
of visible things can be approached.</p>
<p>When the representation from either point of view is carried far
enough, the result is very similar. Work built up on outline
drawing to which has been added light and shade, colour, aerial
perspective, &amp;c., may eventually approximate to the perfect
visual appearance. And inversely, representations approached from
the point of view of pure vision, the mosaic of colour on the
retina, if pushed far enough, may satisfy the mental perception of
form with its touch associations. And of course the two points of
view are intimately connected. You cannot put an accurate outline
round an object without observing the shape it occupies in the
field of vision. And it is difficult to consider the "mosaic of
colour forms" without being very conscious of the objective
significance of the colour masses portrayed. But they present two
entirely different and opposite points of view from which the
representation of objects can be approached. In considering the
subject of drawing I think it necessary to make this division of
the subject, and both methods of form expression should be studied
by the student. Let us call the first method Line Drawing and the
second Mass Drawing. Most modern drawing is a mixture of both these
points of view, but they should be studied separately if confusion
is to be avoided. If <a name='Page_49' id=
"Page_49"></a><span class='pagenum'>49</span>the student neglects
line drawing, his work will lack the expressive significance of
form that only a feeling for lines seems to have the secret of
conveying; while, if he neglects mass drawing, he will be poorly
equipped when he comes to express form with a brush full of paint
to work with.</p>

<h2>IV<br />
LINE DRAWING</h2>
<p>Most of the earliest forms of drawing known to us in history,
like those of the child we were discussing in the last chapter, are
largely in the nature of outline drawings. This is a remarkable
fact considering the somewhat remote relation lines have to the
complete phenomena of vision. Outlines can only be said to exist in
appearances as the boundaries of masses. But even here a line seems
a poor thing from the visual point of view; as the boundaries are
not always clearly defined, but are continually merging into the
surrounding mass and losing themselves to be caught up again later
on and defined once more. Its relationship with visual appearances
is not sufficient to justify the instinct for line drawing. It
comes, I think, as has already been said, from the sense of touch.
When an object is felt there is no merging in the surrounding mass,
but a firm definition of its boundary, which the mind instinctively
conceives as a line.</p>
<p>There is a more direct appeal to the imagination in line drawing
than in possibly anything else in pictorial art. The emotional
stimulus given by fine design is due largely to line work. The
power a line possesses of instinctively directing the eye along its
course is of the utmost value also, enabling the artist to
concentrate the attention of the beholder <a name='Page_51' id=
"Page_51"></a><span class='pagenum'>51</span>where he wishes. Then
there is a harmonic sense in lines and their relationships, a music
of line that is found at the basis of all good art. But this
subject will be treated later on when talking of line rhythm.</p>
<p>Most artists whose work makes a large appeal to the imagination
are strong on the value of line. Blake, whose visual knowledge was
such a negligible quantity, but whose mental perceptions were so
magnificent, was always insisting on its value. And his designs are
splendid examples of its powerful appeal to the imagination.</p>
<p>On this basis of line drawing the development of art proceeded.
The early Egyptian wall paintings were outlines tinted, and the
earliest wall sculpture was an incised outline. After these incised
lines some man of genius thought of cutting away the surface of the
wall between the outlines and modelling it in low relief. The
appearance of this may have suggested to the man painting his
outline on the wall the idea of shading between his outlines.</p>
<p>At any rate the next development was the introduction of a
little shading to relieve the flatness of the line-work and suggest
modelling. And this was as far as things had gone in the direction
of the representation of form, until well on in the Italian
Renaissance. Botticelli used nothing else than an outline lightly
shaded to indicate form. Light and shade were not seriously
perceived until Leonardo da Vinci. And a wonderful discovery it was
thought to be, and was, indeed, although it seems difficult to
understand where men's eyes had been for so long with the phenomena
of light and shade before them all the time. But this is only
another proof of <a name='Page_52' id="Page_52"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>52</span>what cannot be too often insisted on, namely
that the eye only sees what it is on the look-out for, and it may
even be there are things just as wonderful yet to be discovered in
vision.</p>
<p>But it was still the touch association of an object that was the
dominant one; it was within the outline demanded by this sense that
the light and shade were to be introduced as something as it were
put on the object. It was the "solids in space" idea that art was
still appealing to.</p>
<p>"The first object of a painter is to make a simple flat surface
appear like a relievo, and some of its parts detached from the
ground; he who excels all others in that part of the art deserves
the greatest praise,"<a name='FNanchor_1_1' id=
"FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href='#Footnote_1_1'><sup>[1]</sup></a> wrote
Leonardo da Vinci, and the insistence on this "standing out"
quality, with its appeal to the touch sense as something great in
art, sounds very strange in these days. But it must be remembered
that the means of creating this illusion were new to all and
greatly wondered at.</p>
<p class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_1_1' id=
"Footnote_1_1"></a><a href='#FNanchor_1_1'>[1]</a> Leonardo da
Vinci, <i>Treatise on Painting</i>, paragraph 178.</p>
<p>And again, in paragraph 176 of his treatise, Leonardo writes:
"The knowledge of the outline is of most consequence, and yet may
be acquired to great certainty by dint of study; as the outlines of
the human figure, particularly those which do not bend, are
invariably the same. But the knowledge of the situation, quality
and quantity of shadows, being infinite, requires the most
extensive study."</p>
<p>The outlines of the human figure are "invariably the same"? What
does this mean? From the visual point of view we know that the
space occupied by figures in the field of our vision is by no means
"invariably the same," but of great variety. So it cannot be the
visual appearance he is speaking about. <a name='Page_53' id=
"Page_53"></a><span class='pagenum'>53</span>It can only refer to
the mental idea of the shape of the members of the human figure.
The remark "particularly those that do not bend" shows this also,
for when the body is bent up even the mental idea of its form must
be altered. There is no hint yet of vision being exploited for
itself, but only in so far as it yielded material to stimulate this
mental idea of the exterior world.</p>

<p>STUDY BY WATTEAU</p>
<p>From an original drawing in the collection of Charles Ricketts
and Charles Shannon.</p>
</div>
<p>All through the work of the men who used this light and shade
(or chiaroscuro, as it was called) the outline basis remained.
Leonardo, Raphael, Michael Angelo, Titian, and the Venetians were
all faithful to it as the means of holding their pictures together;
although the Venetians, by fusing the edges of their outline
masses, got very near the visual method to be introduced later by
Velazquez.</p>
<p>In this way, little by little, starting from a basis of simple
outline forms, art grew up, each new detail of visual appearance
discovered adding, as it were, another instrument to the orchestra
at the disposal of the artist, enabling him to add to the somewhat
crude directness and simplicity of the early work the graces and
refinements of the more complex work, making the problem of
composition more difficult but increasing the range of its
expression.</p>
<p>But these additions to the visual formula used by artists was
not all gain; the simplicity of the means at the disposal of a
Botticelli gives an innocence and imaginative appeal to his work
that it is difficult to think of preserving with the more complete
visual realisation of later schools. When the realisation of actual
appearance is most complete, the mind is liable to be led away by
side issues connected with the things represented, instead of
seeing the emotional intentions of the artist expressed through
<a name='Page_54' id="Page_54"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>54</span>them. The mind is apt to leave the picture and
looking, as it were, not at it but through it, to pursue a train of
thought associated with the objects represented as real objects,
but alien to the artistic intention of the picture. There is
nothing in these early formulae to disturb the contemplation of the
emotional appeal of pure form and colour. To those who approach a
picture with the idea that the representation of nature, the
"making it look like the real thing," is the sole object of
painting, how strange must be the appearance of such pictures as
Botticelli's.</p>
<p>The accumulation of the details of visual observation in art is
liable eventually to obscure the main idea and disturb the large
sense of design on which so much of the imaginative appeal of a
work of art depends. The large amount of new visual knowledge that
the naturalistic movements of the nineteenth century brought to
light is particularly liable at this time to obscure the simpler
and more primitive qualities on which all good art is built. At the
height of that movement line drawing went out of fashion, and
charcoal, and an awful thing called a stump, took the place of the
point in the schools. Charcoal is a beautiful medium in a dexterous
hand, but is more adaptable to mass than to line drawing. The less
said about the stump the better, although I believe it still
lingers on in some schools.</p>
<p>Line drawing is happily reviving, and nothing is so calculated
to put new life and strength into the vagaries of naturalistic
painting and get back into art a fine sense of design.</p>
<p>This obscuring of the direct appeal of art by the accumulation
of too much naturalistic detail, and the loss of power it entails,
is the cause of artists <a name='Page_55' id=
"Page_55"></a><span class='pagenum'>55</span>having occasionally
gone back to a more primitive convention. There was the Archaistic
movement in Greece, and men like Rossetti and Burne-Jones found a
better means of expressing the things that moved them in the
technique of the fourteenth century. And it was no doubt a feeling
of the weakening influence on art, as an expressive force, of the
elaborate realisations of the modern school, that prompted Puvis de
Chavannes to invent for himself his large primitive manner. It will
be noticed that in these instances it is chiefly the insistence
upon outline that distinguishes these artists from their
contemporaries.</p>
<p>Art, like life, is apt to languish if it gets too far away from
primitive conditions. But, like life also, it is a poor thing and a
very uncouth affair if it has nothing but primitive conditions to
recommend it. Because there is a decadent art about, one need not
make a hero of the pavement artist. But without going to the
extreme of flouting the centuries of culture that art inherits, as
it is now fashionable in many places to do, students will do well
to study at first the early rather than the late work of the
different schools, so as to get in touch with the simple conditions
of design on which good work is built. It is easier to study these
essential qualities when they are not overlaid by so much knowledge
of visual realisation. The skeleton of the picture is more apparent
in the earlier than the later work of any school.</p>
<p>The finest example of the union of the primitive with the most
refined and cultured art the world has ever seen is probably the
Parthenon at Athens, a building that has been the wonder of the
artistic world for over two thousand years. Not only are <a name=
'Page_56' id="Page_56"></a><span class='pagenum'>56</span>the
fragments of its sculptures in the British Museum amazing, but the
beauty and proportions of its architecture are of a refinement that
is, I think, never even attempted in these days. What architect now
thinks of correcting the poorness of hard, straight lines by very
slightly curving them? Or of slightly sloping inwards the columns
of his facade to add to the strength of its appearance? The amount
of these variations is of the very slightest and bears witness to
the pitch of refinement attempted. And yet, with it all, how
simple! There is something of the primitive strength of Stonehenge
in that solemn row of columns rising firmly from the steps
<b>without any base</b>. With all its magnificence, it still
retains the simplicity of the hut from which it was evolved.</p>
<p>Something of the same combination of primitive grandeur and
strength with exquisite refinement of visualisation is seen in the
art of Michael Angelo. His followers adopted the big, muscular type
of their master, but lost the primitive strength he expressed; and
when this primitive force was lost sight of, what a decadence set
in!</p>
<p>This is the point at which art reaches its highest mark: when to
the primitive strength and simplicity of early art are added the
infinite refinements and graces of culture without destroying or
weakening the sublimity of the expression.</p>
<p>In painting, the refinement and graces of culture take the form
of an increasing truth to natural appearances, added bit by bit to
the primitive baldness of early work; until the point is reached,
as it was in the nineteenth century, when apparently the whole
facts of visual nature are incorporated. From this wealth of visual
material, to which must <a name='Page_57' id=
"Page_57"></a><span class='pagenum'>57</span>be added the knowledge
we now have of the arts of the East, of China, Japan, and India,
the modern artist has to select those things that appeal to him;
has to select those elements that answer to his inmost need of
expressing himself as an artist. No wonder a period of artistic
dyspepsia is upon us, no wonder our exhibitions, particularly those
on the Continent, are full of strange, weird things. The problem
before the artist was never so complex, but also never so
interesting. New forms, new combinations, new simplifications are
to be found. But the steadying influence and discipline of line
work were never more necessary to the student.</p>
<p>The primitive force we are in danger of losing depends much on
line, and no work that aims at a sublime impression can dispense
with the basis of a carefully wrought and simple line scheme.</p>
<p>The study, therefore, of pure line drawing is of great
importance to the painter, and the numerous drawings that exist by
the great masters in this method show how much they understood its
value.</p>
<p>And the revival of line drawing, and the desire there is to find
a simpler convention founded on this basis, are among the most
hopeful signs in the art of the moment.</p>

<h2>V<br />
MASS DRAWING</h2>
<p>In the preceding chapter it has, I hope, been shown that outline
drawing is an instinct with Western artists and has been so from
the earliest times; that this instinct is due to the fact that the
first mental idea of an object is the sense of its form as a felt
thing, not a thing seen; and that an outline drawing satisfies and
appeals directly to this mental idea of objects.</p>
<p>But there is another basis of expression directly related to
visual appearances that in the fulness of time was evolved, and has
had a very great influence on modern art. This form of drawing is
based on the consideration of the flat appearances on the retina,
with the knowledge of the felt shapes of objects for the time being
forgotten. In opposition to line drawing, we may call this Mass
Drawing.</p>
<p>The scientific truth of this point of view is obvious. If only
the accurate copying of the appearances of nature were the sole
object of art (an idea to be met with among students) the problem
of painting would be simpler than it is, and would be likely ere
long to be solved by the photographic camera.</p>
<p>This form of drawing is the natural means of expression when a
brush full of paint is in your hands. The reducing of a complicated
appearance <a name='Page_59' id="Page_59"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>59</span>to a few simple masses is the first necessity of
the painter. But this will be fully explained in a later chapter
treating more practically of the practice of mass drawing.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE OF FIFTEENTH-CENTURY CHINESE WORK BY LUI LIANG (BRITISH

<p>Showing how early Chinese masters had developed the mass-drawing
point of view.</p>
</div>
<p>The art of China and Japan appears to have been more [influenced
by this view of natural appearances than that of the West has been,
until quite lately. The Eastern mind does not seem to be so
obsessed by the objectivity of things as is the Western mind. With
us the practical sense of touch is all powerful. "I know that is
so, because I felt it with my hands" would be a characteristic
expression with us. Whereas I do not think it would be an
expression the Eastern mind would use. With them the spiritual
essence of the thing seen appears to be the more real, judging from
their art. And who is to say they may not be right? This is
certainly the impression one gets from their beautiful painting,
with its lightness of texture and avoidance of solidity. It is
founded on nature regarded as a flat vision, instead of a
collection of solids in space. Their use of line is also much more
restrained than with us, and it is seldom used to accentuate the
solidity of things, but chiefly to support the boundaries of masses
and suggest detail. Light and shade, which suggest solidity, are
never used, a wide light where there is no shadow pervades
everything, their drawing being done with the brush in masses.</p>
<p>When, as in the time of Titian, the art of the West had
discovered light and shade, linear perspective, aerial perspective,
&amp;c., and had begun by fusing the edges of the masses to suspect
the necessity of painting to a widely diffused focus, <a name=
'Page_60' id="Page_60"></a><span class='pagenum'>60</span>they had
got very near considering appearances as a visual whole. But it was
not until Velazquez that a picture was painted that was founded
entirely on visual appearances, in which a basis of objective
outlines was discarded and replaced by a structure of tone
masses.</p>
<p>When he took his own painting room with the little Infanta and
her maids as a subject, Velazquez seems to have considered it
entirely as one flat visual impression. The focal attention is
centred on the Infanta, with the figures on either side more or
less out of focus, those on the extreme right being quite blurred.
The reproduction here given unfortunately does not show these
subtleties, and flattens the general appearance very much. The
focus is nowhere sharp, as this would disturb the contemplation of
the large visual impression. And there, I think, for the first
time, the whole gamut of natural vision, tone, colour, form, light
and shade, atmosphere, focus, &amp;c., considered as one
impression, were put on canvas.</p>
<p>All sense of design is lost. The picture has no surface; it is
all atmosphere between the four edges of the frame, and the objects
are within. Placed as it is in the Prado, with the light coming
from the right as in the picture, there is no break between the
real people before it and the figures within, except the slight
yellow veil due to age.</p>
<p>But wonderful as this picture is, as a "tour de force," like his
Venus of the same period in the National Gallery, it is a painter's
picture, and makes but a cold impression on those not interested in
the technique of painting. With the cutting away of the primitive
support of fine outline design and the absence of those accents
conveying a fine form <a name='Page_61' id=
"Page_61"></a><span class='pagenum'>61</span>stimulus to the mind,
art has lost much of its emotional significance.</p>

</div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Impressionist Point of View.</div>
<p>But art has gained a new point of view. With this subjective way
of considering appearances&mdash;this "impressionist vision," as it
has been called&mdash;many things that were too ugly, either from
shape or association, to yield material for the painter, were yet
found, when viewed as part of a scheme of colour sensations on the
retina which the artist considers emotionally and rhythmically, to
lend themselves to new and beautiful harmonies and "ensembles,"
undreamt of by the earlier formulae. And further, many effects of
light that were too hopelessly complicated for painting, considered
on the old light and shade principles (for instance, sunlight
through trees in a wood), were found to be quite paintable,
considered as an impression of various colour masses. The early
formula could never free itself from the object as a solid thing,
and had consequently to confine its attention to beautiful ones.
But from the new point of view, form consists of the shape and
qualities of masses of colour on the retina; and what objects
happen to be the outside cause of these shapes matters little to
the impressionist. Nothing is ugly when seen in a beautiful aspect
of light, and aspect is with them everything. This consideration of
the visual appearance in the first place necessitated an increased
dependence on the model. As he does not now draw from his mental
perceptions the artist has nothing to select the material of his
picture from until it has existed as a seen thing before him: until
he has a visual impression of it in his mind. With the older point
of view (the representation by a pictorial description, as it were,
based <a name='Page_62' id="Page_62"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>62</span>on the mental idea of an object), the model was
not so necessary. In the case of the Impressionist the mental
perception is arrived at from the visual impression, and in the
older point of view the visual impression is the result of the
mental perception. Thus it happens that the Impressionist movement
has produced chiefly pictures inspired by the actual world of
visual phenomena around us, the older point of view producing most
of the pictures deriving their inspiration from the glories of the
imagination, the mental world in the mind of the artist. And
although interesting attempts are being made to produce imaginative
works founded on the impressionist point of view of light and air,
the loss of imaginative appeal consequent upon the destruction of
contours by scintillation, atmosphere, &amp;c., and the loss of
line rhythm it entails, have so far prevented the production of any
very satisfactory results. But undoubtedly there is much new
material brought to light by this movement waiting to be used
imaginatively; and it offers a new field for the selection of
expressive qualities.</p>
<p>This point of view, although continuing to some extent in the
Spanish school, did not come into general recognition until the
last century in France. The most extreme exponents of it are the
body of artists who grouped themselves round Claude Monet. This
impressionist movement, as the critics have labelled it, was the
result of a fierce determination to consider nature solely from the
visual point of view, making no concessions to any other
associations connected with sight. The result was an entirely new
vision of nature, startling and repulsive to eyes unaccustomed to
observation from a purely visual point of view and used only to
seeing the " <a name='Page_63' id="Page_63"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>63</span>feel of things," as it were. The first results
were naturally rather crude. But a great amount of new visual facts
were brought to light, particularly those connected with the
painting of sunlight and half light effects. Indeed the whole
painting of strong light has been permanently affected by the work
of this group of painters. Emancipated from the objective world,
they no longer dissected the object to see what was inside it, but
studied rather the anatomy of the light refracted from it to their
eyes. Finding this to be composed of all the colours of the rainbow
as seen in the solar spectrum, and that all the effects nature
produced are done with different proportions of these colours, they
took them, or the nearest pigments they could get to them, for
their palette, eliminating the earth colours and black. And
further, finding that nature's colours (the rays of coloured light)
when mixed produced different results than their corresponding
pigments mixed together, they determined to use their paints as
pure as possible, placing them one against the other to be mixed as
they came to the eye, the mixture being one of pure colour rays,
not pigments, by this means.</p>
<p>But we are here only concerned with the movement as it affected
form, and must avoid the fascinating province of colour.</p>
<p>Those who had been brought up in the old school of outline form
said there was no drawing in these impressionist pictures, and from
the point of view of the mental idea of form discussed in the last
chapter, there was indeed little, although, had the impression been
realised to a sufficiently definite focus, the sense of touch and
solidity would probably have been satisfied. But the particular
field of this <a name='Page_64' id="Page_64"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>64</span>new point of view, the beauty of tone and colour
relations considered as an impression apart from objectivity, did
not tempt them to carry their work so far as this, or the
insistence on these particular qualities would have been lost.</p>
<p>But interesting and alluring as is the new world of visual music
opened up by this point of view, it is beginning to be realised
that it has failed somehow to satisfy. In the first place, the
implied assumption that one sees with the eye alone is wrong:</p>
<div class='blockquote'>
<p>"In every object there is inexhaustible meaning; the eye sees in
it what the eye brings means of seeing,"<a name='FNanchor_2_2' id=

</div>
<p class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_2_2' id=
"Footnote_2_2"></a><a href='#FNanchor_2_2'>[2]</a> Goethe, quoted
in Carlyle's <i>French Revolution</i>, chap. i.</p>
<p>and it is the mind behind the eye that supplies this means of
perception: <b>one sees with the mind</b>. The ultimate effect of
any picture, be it impressionist, post, anti, or otherwise&mdash;is
its power to stimulate these mental perceptions within the
mind.</p>
<p>But even from the point of view of the <i>true</i> visual
perception (if there is such a thing) that modern art has heard so
much talk of, the copying of the retina picture is not so great a
success. The impression carried away from a scene that has moved us
is not its complete visual aspect. Only those things that are
significant to the felt impression have been retained by the mind;
and if the picture is to be a true representation of this, the
significant facts must be sorted out from the mass of irrelevant
matter and presented in a lively manner. The impressionist's habit
of painting before nature entirely is not calculated to do this.
Going time after time to the same place, even if similar weather
conditions are waited for, although well enough for studies, is
against the production of a fine picture. Every <a name='Page_65'
id="Page_65"></a><span class='pagenum'>65</span>time the artist
goes to the selected spot he receives a different impression, so
that he must either paint all over his picture each time, in which
case his work must be confined to a small scale and will be hurried
in execution, or he must paint a bit of today's impression
alongside of yesterday's, in which case his work will be dull and
lacking in oneness of conception.</p>
<p>And further, in decomposing the colour rays that come to the eye
and painting in pure colour, while great addition was made to the
power of expressing light, yet by destroying the definitions and
enveloping everything in a scintillating atmosphere, the power to
design in a large manner was lost with the wealth of significance
that the music of line can convey.</p>
<p>But impressionism has opened up a view from which much
interesting matter for art is to be gleaned. And everywhere
painters are selecting from this, and grafting it on to some of the
more traditional schools of design.</p>
<p>Our concern here is with the influence this point of view has
had upon draughtsmanship. The influence has been considerable,
particularly with those draughtsmen whose work deals with the
rendering of modern life. It consists in drawing from the
observation of the silhouette occupied by objects in the field of
vision, observing the flat appearance of things as they are on the
retina. This is, of course, the only accurate way in which to
observe visual shapes. The difference between this and the older
point of view is its insistence on the observation of the flat
visual impression to the exclusion of the tactile or touch sense
that by the association of ideas we have come to expect in things
seen. An <a name='Page_66' id="Page_66"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>66</span>increased truth to the character of appearances
has been the result, with a corresponding loss of plastic form
expression.</p>
<p>On pages 66 and 67 a reproduction of a drawing in the British
Museum, attributed to Michael Angelo, is contrasted with one in the
Louvre by Degas. The one is drawn from the line point of view and
the other from the mass. They both contain lines, but in the one
case the lines are the contours of felt forms and in the other the
boundaries of visual masses. In the Michael Angelo the silhouette
is only the result of the overlapping of rich forms considered in
the round. Every muscle and bone has been mentally realised as a
concrete thing and the drawing made as an expression of this idea.
Note the line rhythm also; the sense of energy and movement
conveyed by the swinging curves; and compare with what is said
later (page <a href='#Page_162'>162</a>) about the rhythmic
significance of swinging curves.</p>
<p>Then compare it with the Degas and observe the totally different
attitude of mind in which this drawing has been approached. Instead
of the outlines being the result of forms felt as concrete things,
the silhouette is everywhere considered first, the plastic sense
(nowhere so great as in the other) being arrived at from the
accurate consideration of the mass shapes.</p>
<p>Notice also the increased attention to individual character in
the Degas, observe the pathos of those underfed little arms, and
the hand holding the tired ankle&mdash;how individual it all is.
What a different tale this little figure tells from that given
before the footlights! See with what sympathy the contours have
been searched for those accents expressive of all this.</p>

<p>The rhythm is different also, in the one case being a line
rhythm, and in the other a consideration of the flat pattern of
shapes or masses with a play of lost-and-foundness on the edges
(see later, pages 192 <i>et seq.</i>, variety of edges). It is this
feeling for rhythm and the sympathetic searching for and emphasis
of those points expressive of character, that keep this drawing
from being the mechanical performance which so much concern with
scientific visual accuracy might well have made it, and which has
made mechanical many of the drawings of Degas's followers who
unintelligently copy his method.</p>

<h2>VI<br />
THE ACADEMIC AND CONVENTIONAL</h2>
<p>The terms Academic and Conventional are much used in criticism
and greatly feared by the criticised, often without either party
appearing to have much idea of what is meant. New so-called schools
of painting seem to arrive annually with the spring fashions, and
sooner or later the one of last year gets called out of date, if
not conventional and academic. And as students, for fear of having
their work called by one or other of these dread terms, are
inclined to rush into any new extravagance that comes along, some
inquiry as to their meaning will not be out of place before we pass
into the chapters dealing with academic study.</p>
<p>It has been the cry for some time that Schools of Art turned out
only academic students. And one certainly associates a dead level
of respectable mediocrity with much school work. We can call to
mind a lot of dull, lifeless, highly-finished work, imperfectly
perfect, that has won the prize in many a school competition.
Flaubert says "a form deadens," and it does seem as if the
necessary formality of a school course had some deadening influence
on students; and that there was some important part of the artist's
development which it has failed to recognise and encourage.</p>
<p>The freer system of the French schools has been <a name=
'Page_69' id="Page_69"></a><span class='pagenum'>69</span>in many
cases more successful. But each school was presided over by an
artist of distinction, and this put the students in touch with real
work and thus introduced vitality. In England, until quite lately,
artists were seldom employed in teaching, which was left to men set
aside for the purpose, without any time to carry on original work
of their own. The Royal Academy Schools are an exception to this.
There the students have the advantage of teaching from some
distinguished member or associate who has charge of the upper
school for a month at a time. But as the visitor is constantly
changed, the less experienced students are puzzled by the different
methods advocated, and flounder hopelessly for want of a definite
system to work on; although for a student already in possession of
a good grounding there is much to be said for the system, as
contact with the different masters widens their outlook.</p>
<p>But perhaps the chief mistake in Art Schools has been that they
have too largely confined themselves to training students
mechanically to observe and portray the thing set before them to
copy, an antique figure, a still-life group, a living model sitting
as still and lifeless as he can. Now this is all very well as far
as it goes, but the real matter of art is not necessarily in all
this. And if the real matter of art is neglected too long the
student may find it difficult to get in touch with it again.</p>
<p>These accurate, painstaking school studies are very necessary
indeed as a training for the eye in observing accurately, and the
hand in reproducing the appearances of things, because it is
through the reproduction of natural appearances and the knowledge
of form and colour derived from such study <a name='Page_70' id=
"Page_70"></a><span class='pagenum'>70</span>that the student will
afterwards find the means of giving expression to his feelings. But
when valuable prizes and scholarships are given for them, and
<i>not</i> for really artistic work, they do tend to become the end
instead of the means.</p>
<p>It is of course improbable that even school studies done with
the sole idea of accuracy by a young artist will in all cases be
devoid of artistic feeling; it will creep in, if he has the
artistic instinct. But it is not enough <b>encouraged</b>, and the
prize is generally given to the drawing that is most complete and
like the model in a commonplace way. If a student, moved by a
strong feeling for form, lets himself go and does a fine thing,
probably only remotely like the model to the average eye, the
authorities are puzzled and don't usually know what to make of
it.</p>
<p>There are schools where the most artistic qualities are
encouraged, but they generally neglect the academic side; and the
student leaves them poorly equipped for fine work. Surely it would
be possible to make a distinction, giving prizes for academic
drawings which should be as thoroughly accurate in a mechanical way
as industry and application can make them, and also for artistic
drawings, in which the student should be encouraged to follow his
bent, striving for the expression of any qualities that delight
him, and troubling less about mechanical accuracy. The use of
drawing as an expression of something felt is so often left until
after the school training is done that many students fail to
achieve it altogether. And rows of lifeless pictures, made up of
models copied in different attitudes, with studio properties around
them, are the result, and pass for art in many quarters. Such
pictures often display <a name='Page_71' id=
"Page_71"></a><span class='pagenum'>71</span>considerable ability,
for as Burne-Jones says in one of his letters, "It is very
difficult to paint even a bad picture." But had the ability been
differently directed, the pictures might have been good.</p>

</div>
<p>It is difficult to explain what is wrong with an academic
drawing, and what is the difference between it and fa fine drawing.
But perhaps this difference can be brought home a little more
clearly if you will pardon a rather fanciful simile. I am told that
if you construct a perfectly fitted engine &mdash;the piston
fitting the cylinder with absolute accuracy and the axles their
sockets with no space between, &amp;c.&mdash;it <b>will not
work</b>, but be a lifeless mass of iron. There must be enough play
between the vital parts to allow of some movement; "dither" is, I
believe, the Scotch word for it. The piston must be allowed some
play in the opening of the cylinder through which it passes, or it
will not be able to move and show any life. And the axles of the
wheels in their sockets, and, in fact, all parts of the machine
where life and movement are to occur, must have this play, this
"dither." It has always seemed to me that the accurately fitting
engine was like a good academic drawing, in a way a perfect piece
of workmanship, but lifeless. Imperfectly perfect, because there
was no room left for the play of life. And to carry the simile
further, if you allow too great a play between the parts, so that
they fit one over the other too loosely, the engine will lose power
and become a poor rickety thing. There must be the smallest amount
of play that will allow of its working. And the more perfectly made
the engine, the less will the amount of this "dither" be.</p>
<p>The word "dither" will be a useful name to give <a name=
'Page_72' id="Page_72"></a><span class='pagenum'>72</span>that
elusive quality, that play on mechanical accuracy, existing in all
vital art. <b>It is this vital quality that has not yet received
much attention in art training.</b></p>
<p>It is here that the photograph fails, it can only at best give
mechanical accuracy, whereas art gives the impression of a live,
individual consciousness. Where the recording instrument is a live
individual, there is no mechanical standard of accuracy possible,
as every recording instrument is a different personality. And it is
the subtle differences in the individual renderings of nature that
are the life-blood of art. The photograph, on account of its being
chained to mechanical accuracy, has none of this play of life to
give it charm. It only approaches artistic conditions when it is
blurred, vague, and indefinite, as in so-called artistic
photography, for then only can some amount of this vitalising play,
this "dither" be imagined to exist.</p>
<p>It is this perfect accuracy, this lack of play, of variety, that
makes the machine-made article so lifeless. Wherever there is life
there is variety, and the substitution of the machine-made for the
hand-made article has impoverished the world to a greater extent
than we are probably yet aware of. Whereas formerly, before the
advent of machinery, the commonest article you could pick up had a
life and warmth which gave it individual interest, now everything
is turned out to such a perfection of deadness that one is driven
to pick up and collect, in sheer desperation, the commonest rubbish
still surviving from the earlier period.</p>
<p>But to return to our drawings. If the variations from strict
accuracy made under the influence <a name='Page_73' id=
"Page_73"></a><span class='pagenum'>73</span>of feeling are too
great, the result will be a caricature. The variations in a
beautiful drawing are so subtle as often to defy detection. The
studies of Ingres are an instance of what I mean. How true and
instinct with life are his lines, and how easily one might assume
that they were merely accurate. But no merely accurate work would
have the impelling quality these drawings possess. If the writer
may venture an opinion on so great an artist, the subtle difference
we are talking about was sometimes missed by even Ingres himself,
when he transferred his drawings to the canvas; and the pictures
have in some cases become academic and lifeless. Without the
stimulus of nature before him it was difficult to preserve the
"dither" in the drawing, and the life has escaped. This is the
great difficulty of working from studies; it is so easy to lose
those little points in your drawing that make for vitality of
expression, in the process of copying in cold blood.</p>

</div>
<p>The fact is: it is only the academic that can be taught. And it
is no small thing if this is well done in a school. The qualities
that give vitality and distinction to drawing must be appreciated
by the student himself, and may often assert themselves in his
drawing without his being aware that he is doing aught but honestly
copying. And if he has trained himself thoroughly he will not find
much difficulty when he is moved to vital expression. All the
master can do is to stand by and encourage whenever he sees
evidence of the real thing. But there is undoubtedly this danger of
the school studies becoming the end instead of the means.</p>
<p>A drawing is not necessarily academic because it is thorough,
but only because it is dead. Neither <a name='Page_74' id=
"Page_74"></a><span class='pagenum'>74</span>is a drawing
necessarily academic because it is done in what is called a
conventional style, any more than it is good because it is done in
an unconventional style. The test is whether it has life and
conveys genuine feeling.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>There is much foolish talk about conventional art, as if art
could ever get away from conventions, if it would. The convention
will be more natural or more abstract according to the nature of
the thing to be conveyed and the medium employed to express it. But
naturalism is just as much a convention as any of the other isms
that art has lately been so assailed with. For a really
unconventional art there is Madame Tussaud's Waxworks. There, even
the convention of a frame and flat surface are done away with,
besides the painted symbols to represent things. They have real
natural chairs, tables, and floors, real clothes, and even real
hair. Realism everywhere, but no life. And we all know the result.
There is more expression of life in a few lines scribbled on paper
by a good artist than in all the reality of the popular show.</p>
<p>It would seem that, after a certain point, the nearer your
picture approaches the actual illusion of natural appearance, the
further you are from the expression of life. One can never hope to
surpass the illusionary appearance of a <b>tableau vivant</b>.
There you have real, living people. But what an awful deathlike
stillness is felt when the curtain is drawn aside. The nearer you
approach the actual in all its completeness, the more evident is
the lack of that <b>movement</b> which always accompanies life. You
cannot express life by copying laboriously <a name='Page_75' id=
"Page_75"></a><span class='pagenum'>75</span>natural appearances.
Those things in the appearance that convey vital expression and are
capable of being translated into the medium he is working with,
have to be sought by the artist, and the painted symbols of his
picture made accordingly. This lack of the movement of life is
never noticed in a good picture, on the other hand the figures are
often felt to move.</p>
<p>Pictures are blamed for being conventional when it is lack of
vitality that is the trouble. If the convention adopted has not
been vitalised by the emotion that is the reason of the painting,
it will, of course, be a lifeless affair. But however abstract and
unnaturalistic the manner adopted, if it has been truly felt by the
artist as the right means of expressing his emotional idea, it will
have life and should not be called conventional in the commonly
accepted offensive use of the term.</p>
<p>It is only when a painter consciously chooses a manner not his
own, which he does not comprehend and is incapable of firing with
his own personality, that his picture is ridiculous and
conventional in the dead sense.</p>
<p>But every age differs in its temperament, and the artistic
conventions of one age seldom fit another. The artist has to
discover a convention for himself, one that fits his particular
individuality. But this is done simply and naturally&mdash;not by
starting out with the intention of flouting all traditional
conventions on principle; nor, on the other hand, by accepting them
all on principle, but by simply following his own bent and
selecting what appeals to him in anything and everything that comes
within the range of his vision. The result is likely to be
something very different from <a name='Page_76' id=
"Page_76"></a><span class='pagenum'>76</span>the violent exploits
in peculiarity that have been masquerading as originality lately.
<b>Originality is more concerned with sincerity than with
peculiarity.</b></p>
<p>The struggling and fretting after originality that one sees in
modern art is certainly an evidence of vitality, but one is
inclined to doubt whether anything really original was ever done in
so forced a way. The older masters, it seems, were content
sincerely to try and do the best they were capable of doing. And
this continual striving to do better led them almost unconsciously
to new and original results. Originality is a quality over which an
artist has as little influence as over the shape and distinction of
his features. All he can do is to be sincere and try and find out
the things that really move him and that he really likes. If he has
a strong and original character, he will have no difficulty in
this, and his work will be original in the true sense. And if he
has not, it is a matter of opinion whether he is not better
employed in working along the lines of some well-tried manner that
will at any rate keep him from doing anything really bad, than in
struggling to cloak his own commonplaceness under violent essays in
peculiarity and the avoidance of the obvious at all costs.</p>
<p>But while speaking against fretting after eccentricity, don't
let it be assumed that any discouragement is being given to genuine
new points of view. In art, when a thing has once been well done
and has found embodiment in some complete work of art, it has been
done once for all. The circumstances that produced it are never
likely to occur again. That is why those painters who continue to
reproduce a picture of theirs (we do not mean literally) that had
been a success in the first instance, never <a name='Page_77' id=
"Page_77"></a><span class='pagenum'>77</span>afterwards obtain the
success of the original performance. Every beautiful work of art is
a new creation, the result of particular circumstances in the life
of the artist and the time of its production, that have never
existed before and will never recur again. Were any of the great
masters of the past alive now, they would do very different work
from what they did then, the circumstances being so entirely
different. So that should anybody seek to paint like Titian now, by
trying to paint like Titian did in his time, he could not attempt
anything more unlike the spirit of that master; which in its day,
like the spirit of all masters, was most advanced. But it is only
by a scrupulously sincere and truthful attitude of mind that the
new and original circumstances in which we find ourselves can be
taken advantage of for the production of original work. And
self-conscious seeking after peculiarity only stops the natural
evolution and produces abortions.</p>
<p>But do not be frightened by conventions, the different materials
in which the artist works impose their conventions. And as it is
through these materials that he has to find expression, what
expressive qualities they possess must be studied, and those facts
in nature selected that are in harmony with them. The treatment of
hair by sculptors is an extreme instance of this. What are those
qualities of hair that are amenable to expression in stone?
Obviously they are few, and confined chiefly to the mass forms in
which the hair arranges itself. The finest sculptors have never
attempted more than this, have never lost sight of the fact that it
was stone they were working with, and never made any attempt to
create an illusion of real hair. And in the same way, when working
in bronze, the fine artist <a name='Page_78' id=
"Page_78"></a><span class='pagenum'>78</span>never loses sight of
the fact that it is bronze with which he is working. How sadly the
distinguished painter to whom a misguided administration entrusted
the work of modelling the British emblem overlooked this, may be
seen any day in Trafalgar Square, the lions there possessing none
of the splendour of bronze but looking as if they were modelled in
dough, and possessing in consequence none of the vital qualities of
the lion. It is interesting to compare them with the little lion
Alfred Stevens modelled for the railing of the British Museum, and
to speculate on what a thrill we might have received every time we
passed Trafalgar Square, had he been entrusted with the work, as he
might have been.</p>
<p>And in painting, the great painters never lose sight of the fact
that it is paint with which they are expressing themselves. And
although paint is capable of approaching much nearer an actual
illusory appearance of nature than stone or bronze, they never push
this to the point where you forget that it is paint. This has been
left for some of the smaller men.</p>
<p>And when it comes to drawing, the great artists have always
confined themselves to the qualities in nature that the tool they
were drawing with was capable of expressing, and no others. Whether
working with pen, pencil, chalk, or charcoal, they always created a
convention within which unlimited expression has been possible.</p>
<p>To sum up, academic drawing is all that can be really taught,
and is as necessary to the painter as the practising of exercises
is to the musician, that his powers of observation and execution
may be trained. But the vital matter of art is not in all this
necessary training. And this fact the student <a name='Page_79' id=
"Page_79"></a><span class='pagenum'>79</span>should always keep in
mind, and be ever ready to give rein to those natural enthusiasms
which, if he is an artist, he will find welling up within him. The
danger is that the absorbing interest in his academic studies may
take up his whole attention, to the neglect of the instinctive
qualities that he should possess the possession of which alone will
entitle him to be an artist.</p>

<h2>VII<br />
THE STUDY OF DRAWING</h2>
<p>We have seen that there are two extreme points of view from
which the representation of form can be approached, that of outline
directly related to the mental idea of form with its touch
association on the one hand, and that of mass connected directly
with the visual picture on the retina on the other.</p>
<p>Now, between these two extreme points of view there are an
infinite variety of styles combining them both and leaning more to
the one side or the other, as the case may be. But it is advisable
for the student to study both separately, for there are different
things to be learnt and different expressive qualities in nature to
be studied in both.</p>
<p>From the study of outline drawing the eye is trained to accurate
observation and learns the expressive value of a line. And the hand
is also trained to definite statement, the student being led on by
degrees from simple outlines to approach the full realisation of
form in all the complexity of light and shade.</p>
<p>But at the same time he should study mass drawing with paint
from the purely visual point of view, in order to be introduced to
the important study of tone values and the expression of form by
means of planes. And so by degrees he will <a name='Page_81' id=
"Page_81"></a><span class='pagenum'>81</span>learn accurately to
observe and portray the tone masses (their shapes and values) to
which all visual appearances can be reduced; and he will gradually
arrive at the full realisation of form&mdash;a realisation that
will bring him to a point somewhat similar to that arrived at from
the opposite point of view of an outline to which has been added
light and shade, &amp;c.</p>
<p>But unless both points of view are studied, the student's work
will be incomplete. If form be studied only from the outline point
of view, and what have been called sculptor's drawings alone
attempted, the student will lack knowledge of the tone and
atmosphere that always envelop form in nature. And also he will be
poorly equipped when he comes to exchange the pencil for a brush
and endeavours to express himself in paint.</p>
<p>And if his studies be only from the mass point of view, the
training of his eye to the accurate observation of all the
subtleties of contours and the construction of form will be
neglected. And he will not understand the mental form stimulus that
the direction and swing of a brush stroke can give. These and many
things connected with expression can best be studied in line
work.</p>
<p>Let the student therefore begin on the principles adopted in
most schools, with outline studies of simple casts or models, and
gradually add light and shade. When he has acquired more
proficiency he may approach drawing from the life. This is
sufficiently well done in the numerous schools of art that now
exist all over the country. But, at the same time (and this, as far
as I know, is not done anywhere), the student should begin some
simple form of mass drawing in paint, simple exercises, <a name=
'Page_83' id="Page_83"></a><span class='pagenum'>83</span>as is
explained later in the chapter on Mass Drawing, Practical, being at
first attempted and criticised solely from the point of view of
tone values.</p>

</div>
<p>From lack of this elementary tone study, the student, when he
approaches painting for the first time, with only his outline and
light and shade knowledge, is entirely at sea. With brushes and
paint he is presented with a problem of form expressions entirely
new. And he usually begins to flounder about, using his paint as
much like chalk on paper as possible. And timid of losing his
outlines, he fears to put down a mass, as he has no knowledge of
reducing appearances to a structure of tone masses or planes.</p>
<p>I would suggest, therefore, that the student should study
simultaneously from these two points of view, beginning with their
most extreme positions, that is, bare outline on the one side and
on the other side tone masses criticised for their accuracy of
values only in the first instance. As he advances, the one study
will help the other. The line work will help the accuracy with
which he observes the shapes of masses, and when he comes to light
and shade his knowledge of tone values will help him here. United
at last, when complete light and shade has been added to his
outline drawings and to his mass drawing an intimate knowledge of
form, the results will approximate and the two paths will meet. But
if the qualities appertaining to either point of view are not
studied separately, the result is confusion and the "muddling
through" method so common in our schools of art.</p>

<h2>VIII<br />
LINE DRAWING: PRACTICAL</h2>
<p>Seeing that the first condition of your drawing is that it has
to be made on a flat surface, no matter whether it is to be in line
or mass you intend to draw, it is obvious that appearances must be
reduced to terms of a flat surface before they can be expressed on
paper. And this is the first difficulty that confronts the student
in attempting to draw a solid object. He has so acquired the habit
of perceiving the solidity of things, as was explained in an
earlier chapter, that no little difficulty will be experienced in
accurately seeing them as a flat picture.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Observing Solids as a Flat copy.</div>
<p>As it is only from one point of view that things can be drawn,
and as we have two eyes, therefore two points of view, the closing
of one eye will be helpful at first.</p>
<p>The simplest and most mechanical way of observing things as a
flat subject is to have a piece of cardboard with a rectangular
hole cut out of the middle, and also pieces of cotton threaded
through it in such a manner that they make a pattern of squares
across the opening, as in the accompanying sketch. To make such a
frame, get a piece of stiff cardboard, about 12 inches by 9 inches,
and cut a rectangular hole in the centre, 7 inches by 5 inches, as
in Diagram III. Now mark off the inches on <a name='Page_85' id=
"Page_85"></a><span class='pagenum'>85</span>all sides of the
opening, and taking some black thread, pass it through the point A
with a needle (fixing the end at this point with sealing-wax), and
across the opening to the corresponding point on the opposite side.
Take it along to the next point, as shown by the dotted line, and
pass it through and across the opening again, and so on, until B is
reached, when the thread should be held by some sealing-wax quite
taut everywhere. Do the same for the other side. This frame should
be held between the eye and the object to be drawn <a name=
'Page_86' id="Page_86"></a><span class='pagenum'>86</span>(one eye
being closed) in a perfectly vertical position, and with the
rectangular sides of the opening vertical and horizontal. The
object can then be observed as a flat copy. The trellis of cotton
will greatly help the student in seeing the subject to be drawn in
two dimensions, and this is the first technical difficulty the
young draughtsman has to overcome. It is useful also in training
the eye to see the proportions of different parts one to another,
the squares of equal size giving one a unit of measurement by which
all parts can be scaled.</p>

</div>
<div class='sidenote'>Fixing Positions of Salient Points</div>
<p>Vertical and horizontal lines are also of the utmost importance
in that first consideration for setting out a drawing, namely the
fixing of salient points, and getting their relative Positions.
Fig. Z, on page 87 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#diagram04">Diagram
IV</a>], will illustrate what is meant. Let A B C D E be assumed to
be points of some importance in an object you wish to draw.
Unaided, the placing of these points would be a matter of
considerable difficulty. But if you assume a vertical line drawn
from A, the positions of B, C, D, and E can be observed in relation
to it by noting the height and length of horizontal lines drawn
from them to this vertical line. This vertical can be drawn by
holding a plumb line at arm's length (closing one eye, of course)
and bringing it to a position where it will cover the point A on
your subject. The position of the other points on either side of
this vertical line can then be observed. Or a knitting-needle can
be held vertically before you at arm's length, giving you a line
passing through point A. The advantage of the needle is that
comparative measurements can be taken with it.</p>

</div>
<p><a name='Page_88' id="Page_88"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>88</span>In measuring comparative distances the needle
should always be held at arm's length and the eye kept in one
position during the operation; and, whether held vertically or
horizontally, always kept in a vertical plane, that is, either
straight up and down, or across at right angles to the line of your
vision. If these things are not carefully observed, your
comparisons will not be true. The method employed is to run the
thumb-nail up the needle until the distance from the point so
reached to the top exactly corresponds with the distance on the
object you wish to measure. Having this carefully noted on your
needle, without moving the position of your eye, you can move your
outstretched arm and compare it with other distances on the object.
<b>It is never advisable to compare other than vertical and
horizontal measurements.</b> In our diagram the points were drawn
at random and do not come in any obvious mathematical relationship,
and this is the usual circumstance in nature. But point C will be
found to be a little above the half, and point D a little less than
a third of the way up the vertical line. How much above the half
and less than the third will have to be observed by eye and a
corresponding amount allowed in setting out your drawing. In the
horizontal distances, B will be found to be one-fourth the distance
from X to the height of C on the right of our vertical line, and C
a little more than this distance to the left, while the distance on
the right of D is a little less than one-fifth of the whole height.
The height of B is so near the top as to be best judged by eye, and
its distance to the right is the same as B. These measurements are
never to be taken as absolutely accurate, but are a great help to
beginners in training <a name='Page_89' id=

<p>Plate XVII.</p>
<p>DEMONSTRATION DRAWING MADE BEFORE THE STUDENTS OF THE GOLDSMITHS
COLLEGE SCHOOL OF ART</p>
<p>Illustrating how different directions of lines can help
expression of form.</p>
</div>
<p>It is useful if one can establish a unit of measurement, some
conspicuous distance that does not vary in the object (if a living
model a great many distances will be constantly varying), and with
which all distances can be compared.</p>
<p>In setting out a drawing, this fixing of certain salient points
is the first thing for the student to do. The drawing reproduced on
page 90 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate18">Plate XVIII</a>] has
been made to illustrate the method of procedure it is advisable to
adopt in training the eye to accurate observation. It was felt that
a vertical line drawn through the pit of the arm would be the most
useful for taking measurements on, and this was first drawn and its
length decided upon. Train yourself to draw between limits decided
upon at the start. This power will be of great use to you when you
wish to place a figure in an exact position in a picture. The next
thing to do is to get the relative heights of different points
marked upon this line. The fold at the pit of the stomach was found
to be exactly in the centre. This was a useful start, and it is
generally advisable to note where the half comes first, and very
useful if it comes in some obvious place. Other measurements were
taken in the same way as our points A B C D E in the diagram on
page 87 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#diagram04">Diagram IV</a>],
and horizontal lines drawn across, and the transverse distances
measured in relation to the heights. I have left these lines on the
drawing, and also different parts of it unfinished, so as to show
the different stages of the work. These guide lines are done
mentally later on, when the student is more advanced, and with more
accuracy than the clumsy knitting-needle. <a name='Page_90' id=
"Page_90"></a><span class='pagenum'>90</span>But before the habit
of having constantly in mind a vertical and horizontal line with
which to compare positions is acquired, they should be put in with
as much accuracy as measuring can give.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Blocking in your Drawing.</div>
<p>The next thing to do is to block out the spaces corresponding to
those occupied by the model in the field of your vision. The method
employed to do this is somewhat similar to that adopted by a
surveyor in drawing the plan of a field. Assuming he had an
irregular shaped one, such as is drawn in Fig. X, page 87
[Transcribers Note: <a href="#diagram04">Diagram IV</a>], he would
proceed to invest it with straight lines, taking advantage of any
straightness in the boundary, noting the length and the angles at
which these straight lines cut each other, and then reproducing
them to scale on his plan. Once having got this scaffolding
accurately placed, he can draw the irregularities of the shape in
relation to these lines with some certainty of getting them
right.</p>
<p>You should proceed in very much the same way to block out the
spaces that the forms of your drawing are to occupy. I have
produced these blocking-out lines beyond what was necessary in the
accompanying drawing (page 87 [Transcribers Note: <a href=
"#diagram04">Diagram IV</a>]), in order to show them more
clearly.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>How to observe the Shape of Curves.</div>
<p>There is yet another method of construction useful in noting
accurately the shape of a curved line, which is illustrated in Fig.
Y, page 87 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#diagram04">Diagram
IV</a>]. First of all, fix the positions of the extremities of the
line by means of the vertical and horizontal. And also, as this is
a double curve, the point at which the curvature changes from one
direction to the other: point C. By drawing lines CA, CB and noting
the distances <a name='Page_91' id="Page_91"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>91</span>your curves travel from these straight lines,
and particularly the relative position of the farthest points
reached, their curvature can be accurately observed and copied. In
noting the varying curvature of forms, this construction should
always be in your mind to enable you to observe them accurately.
First note the points at which the curvature begins and ends, and
then the distances it travels from a line joining these two points,
holding up a pencil or knitting-needle against the model if need
be.</p>

<br />
<div class='sidenote'>The Drawing proper.</div>
<p>A drawing being blocked out in such a state as the further leg
and foot of our demonstration drawing (page 90 [Transcribers Note:
<a href="#plate13">Plate XVIII</a>]), it is time to begin the
drawing proper. So far you have only been pegging out the ground it
is going to occupy. This initial scaffolding, so necessary to train
the eye, should be done as accurately as possible, but don't let it
interfere with your freedom in expressing the forms afterwards. The
work up to this point has been mechanical, but it is time to
consider the subject with some feeling for form. Here knowledge of
the structure of bones and muscles that underlie the skin will help
you to seize on those things that are significant and express the
form of the figure. And the student cannot do better than study the
excellent book by Sir Alfred D. Fripp on this subject, entitled
Human Anatomy for Art Students. Notice particularly the swing of
the action, such things as the pull occasioned by the arm resting
on the farther thigh, and the prominence given to the forms by the
straining of the skin at the shoulder. Also the firm lines of the
bent back and the crumpled forms of the front of the body. Notice
the overlapping of the con<a name='Page_92' id=
"Page_92"></a><span class='pagenum'>92</span>tours, and where they
are accentuated and where more lost, &amp;c., drawing with as much
feeling and conviction as you are capable of. You will have for
some time to work tentatively, feeling for the true shapes that you
do not yet rightly see, but as soon as you feel any confidence,
remember it should be your aim to express yourself freely and
swiftly.</p>
<p>There is a tendency in some quarters to discourage this blocking
in of the forms in straight lines, and certainly it has been
harmful to the freedom of expression in the work of some students.
They not only begin the drawing with this mechanical blocking in,
but continue it in the same mechanical fashion, cutting up almost
all their curves into flatnesses, and never once breaking free from
this scaffolding to indulge in the enjoyment of free line
expression. This, of course, is bad, and yet the character of a
curved line is hardly to be accurately studied in any other way
than by observing its relation to straight lines. The inclination
and length of straight lines can be observed with certainty. But a
curve has not this definiteness, and is a very unstable thing to
set about copying unaided. Who but the highly skilled draughtsman
could attempt to copy our random shape at Fig. X, page 87
[Transcribers Note: <a href="#diagram04">Diagram IV</a>], without
any guiding straight lines? And even the highly skilled draughtsman
would draw such straight lines mentally. So that some blocking out
of the curved forms, either done practically or in imagination,
must be adopted to rightly observe any shapes. But do not forget
that this is only a scaffolding, and should always be regarded as
such and kicked away as soon as real form expression with any
feeling begins.</p>
<p><a name='Page_93' id="Page_93"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>93</span>But it will be some years before the beginner
has got his eye trained to such accuracy of observation that he can
dispense with it.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>In Blocking-in observe Shape of the
Background as much as the Object.</div>
<p>In the case of foreshortenings, the eye, unaided by this
blocking out, is always apt to be led astray. And here the
observation of the shape of the background against the object will
be of great assistance. The appearance of the foreshortened object
is so unlike what you know it to be as a solid thing, that much as
it is as well to concentrate the attention on the background rather
than on the form in this blocking-out process. And in fact, in
blocking out any object, whether foreshortened or not, the shape of
the background should be observed as carefully as any other shape.
But in making the drawing proper, the forms must be observed in
their inner relations. That is to say, the lines bounding one side
of a form must be observed in relation to the lines bounding the
other side; as the true expression of form, which is the object of
drawing, depends on the true relationship of these boundaries. The
drawing of the two sides should be carried on simultaneously, so
that one may constantly compare them.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Boundaries a series of Overlappings.</div>
<p>The boundaries of forms with any complexity, such as the human
figure, are not continuous lines. One form overlaps another, like
the lines of a range of hills. And this overlapping should be
sought for and carefully expressed, the outlines being made up of a
series of overlappings.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Shading.</div>
<p>In Line Drawing shading should only be used to aid the
expression of form. It is not advisable to aim at representing the
true tone values.</p>
<p><a name='Page_94' id="Page_94"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>94</span>In direct light it will be observed that a solid
object has some portion of its surface in light, while other
portions, those turned away from the light, are in shadow. Shadows
are also cast on the ground and surrounding objects, called cast
shadows. The parts of an object reflecting the most direct light
are called the high lights. If the object have a shiny surface
these lights are clear and distinct; if a dull surface, soft and
diffused. In the case of a very shiny surface, such as a glazed
pot, the light may be reflected so completely that a picture of the
source of light, usually a window, will be seen.</p>
<p>In the diagram on page 95 [Transcribers Note: <a href=
"#diagram05">Diagram V</a>], let A represent the plan of a cone, B
C the opening of a window, and D the eye of the spectator, and E F
G the wall of a room. Light travels in straight lines from the
window, strikes the surface of the cone, and is reflected to the
eye, making the angle of incidence equal to the angle of
reflection, the angle of incidence being that made by the light
striking an object, and the angle of reflection that made by the
light in leaving the surface.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the lines B1D, C2D are the limits of the
direct rays of light that come to the eye from the cone, and that
therefore between points 1 and 2 will be seen the highest light. If
the cone have a perfect reflecting surface, such as a looking-glass
has, this would be all the direct light that would be reflected
from the cone to the eye. But assuming it to have what is called a
dull surface, light would be reflected from other parts also,
although not in so great a quantity. If what is called a dull
surface is looked at under a microscope it will be found to be
quite rough, <a name='Page_96' id="Page_96"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>96</span><i>i.e.</i> made up of many facets which catch
light at different angles.</p>

</div>
<p>Lines B4, C3 represent the extreme limits of light that can be
received by the cone, and therefore at points 3 and 4 the shadow
will commence. The fact that light is reflected to the eye right up
to the point 3 does not upset the theory that it can only be
reflected from points where the angle of incidence can equal the
angle of reflection, as it would seem to do, because the surface
being rough presents facets at different angles, from some of which
it can be reflected to the eye right up to point 3. The number of
these facets that can so reflect is naturally greatest near the
high lights, and gets gradually less as the surface turns more
away; until the point is reached where the shadows begin, at which
point the surface positively turns away from the light and the
reflection of direct light ceases altogether. After point 3 there
would be no light coming to the eye from the object, were it not
that it receives reflected light. Now, the greatest amount of
reflected light will come from the direction opposite to that of
the direct light, as all objects in this direction are strongly
lit. The surface of the wall between points E and H, being directly
opposite the light, will give most reflection. And between points 5
and 6 this light will be reflected by the cone to the eye in its
greatest intensity, since at these points the angles of incidence
equal the angles of reflection. The other parts of the shadow will
receive a certain amount of reflected light, lessening in amount on
either side of these points. We have now rays of light coming to
the eye from the cone between the extreme points 7 and 8. From 7 to
3 we have <a name='Page_97' id="Page_97"></a><span class=

and 2 the high light. Between 3 and 8 the shadows, with the
greatest amount of reflected light between 5 and 6.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATING CURVED LINKS SUGGESTING FULLNESS AND
FORESHORTENING</p>
</div>
<p>I should not have troubled the reader with this tedious diagram
were it not that certain facts about light and shade can be learned
from it. The first is that the high lights come much more within
the edge of the object than you would have expected. With the light
directly opposite point 7, one might have thought the highest light
would have come there, and that is where many students put it,
until the loss of roundness in the appearance of their work makes
them look more carefully for its position. So remember always to
look out for high lights within the contours of forms, not on the
edges.</p>
<p>The next thing to notice is that <b>the darkest part of the
shadow will come nearest the lights between points 3 and 5</b>.
This is the part turned most away from the direction of the
greatest amount of reflected light, and therefore receiving least.
The lightest part of the shadow will be in the middle, rather
towards the side away from the light, generally speaking. The
shadow cast on the ground will be dark, like the darkest part of
the shadow on the cone, as its surface is also turned away from the
chief source of reflected light.</p>
<p>Although the artist will very seldom be called upon to draw a
cone, the same principles of light and shade that are so clearly
seen in such a simple figure obtain throughout the whole of nature.
This is why the much abused drawing and shading from whitened
blocks and pots is so useful. Nothing so clearly impresses the
general laws of light and shade as this so-called dull study.</p>
<p><a name='Page_98' id="Page_98"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>98</span>This lightening of shadows in the middle by
reflected light and darkening towards their edges is a very
important thing to remember, the heavy, smoky look students' early
work is so prone to, being almost entirely due to their neglect
through ignorance of this principle. Nothing is more awful than
shadows darker in the middle and gradually lighter towards their
edges. Of course, where there is a deep hollow in the shadow parts,
as at the armpit and the fold at the navel in the drawing on page
90 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate18">Plate XVIII</a>], you
will get a darker tone. But this does not contradict the principle
that generally shadows are lighter in the middle and darker towards
the edges. Note the luminous quality the observation of this
principle gives the shadow on the body of our demonstration
drawing.</p>
<p>This is a crude statement of the general principles of light and
shade on a simple round object. In one with complex surfaces the
varieties of light and shade are infinite. But the same principles
hold good. The surfaces turned more to the source of light receive
the greatest amount, and are the lightest. And from these parts the
amount of light lessens through what are called the half tones as
the surface turns more away, until a point is reached where no more
direct light is received, and the shadows begin. And in the shadows
the same law applies: those surfaces turned most towards the source
of reflected light will receive the most, and the amount received
will gradually lessen as the surface turns away, until at the point
immediately before where the half tones begin the amount of
reflected light will be very little, and in consequence the darkest
part of the shadows may be looked for. There may, of course, be
other sources of direct <a name='Page_99' id=
"Page_99"></a><span class='pagenum'>99</span>light on the shadow
side that will entirely alter and complicate the effect. Or one may
draw in a wide, diffused light, such as is found in the open air on
a grey day; in which case there will be little or no shadow, the
modelling depending entirely on degrees of light and half tone.</p>
<p>In studying the principles of simple light and shade it is
advisable to draw from objects of one local colour, such as white
casts. In parti-coloured objects the problem is complicated by the
different tones of the local colour. In line drawing it is as well
to take as little notice as possible of these variations which
disturb the contemplation of pure form and do not belong to the
particular province of form expression with which drawing is
concerned.</p>
<p>Although one has selected a strong half light and half shade
effect to illustrate the general principles of light and shade, it
is not advisable in making line drawings to select such a position.
A point of view with a fairly wide light at your back is the best.
In this position little shadow will be seen, most of the forms
being expressed by the play of light and half tone. The contours,
as they are turned away from the light, will naturally be darker,
and against a light background your subject has an appearance with
dark edges that is easily expressed by a line drawing. Strong light
and shade effects should be left for mass drawing. You seldom see
any shadows in Holbein's drawings; he seems to have put his sitters
near a wide window, close against which he worked. Select also a
background as near the tone of the highest light on the object to
be drawn as possible. This will show up clearly the contour. In the
case of a portrait drawing, a newspaper hung behind the head
answers very well and <a name='Page_100' id=
"Page_100"></a><span class='pagenum'>100</span>is always easily
obtained. The tone of it can be varied by the distance at which it
is placed from the head, and by the angle at which it is turned
away from or towards the light.</p>
<p>Don't burden a line drawing with heavy half tones and shadows;
keep them light. The beauty that is the particular province of line
drawing is the beauty of contours, and this is marred by heavy
light and shade. Great draughtsmen use only just enough to express
the form, but never to attempt the expression of tone. Think of the
half tones as part of the lights and not as part of the
shadows.</p>
<p>There are many different methods of drawing in line, and a
student of any originality will find one that suits his
temperament. But I will try and illustrate one that is at any rate
logical, and that may serve as a fair type of line drawing
generally.</p>
<p>The appearance of an object is first considered as a series of
contours, some forming the boundaries of the form against the
background, and others the boundaries of the subordinate forms
within these bounding lines. The light and shade and differences of
local colour (like the lips, eyebrows, and eyes in a head) are
considered together as tones of varying degrees of lightness and
darkness, and suggested by means of lines drawn parallel across the
drawing from left to right, and from below upwards, or vice versa,
darker and closer together when depth is wanted, and fainter and
further apart where delicacy is demanded, and varying in thickness
when gradation is needed. This rule of parallel shading is broken
only when strongly marked forms, such as the swing lines of hair, a
prominent bone or straining muscles, &amp;c., demand it. This
parallel shading gives a great beauty of <a name='Page_101' id=
"Page_101"></a><span class='pagenum'>101</span>surface and
fleshiness to a drawing. The lines following, as it were, the
direction of the light across the object rather than the form, give
a unity that has a great charm. It is more suited to drawings where
extreme delicacy of form is desired, and is usually used in silver
point work, a medium capable of the utmost refinement.</p>

<p>Plate XX.</p>
<p>STUDY FOR THE FIGURE OF LOVE IN THE PICTURE "LOVE LEAVING
PSYCHE" ILLUSTRATING A METHOD OF DRAWING</p>
<p>The lines of shading following a convenient parallel direction
unless prominent forms demand otherwise.</p>
</div>
<p>In this method the lines of shading not being much varied in
direction or curved at all, a minimum amount of that "form
stimulus" is conveyed. The curving of the lines in shading adds
considerably to the force of the relief, and suggests much stronger
modelling. In the case of foreshortened effects, where the forms
are seen at their fullest, arching one over the other, some
curvature in the lines of shading is of considerable advantage in
adding to the foreshortened look.</p>
<p>Lines drawn down the forms give an appearance of great strength
and toughness, a tense look. And this quality is very useful in
suggesting such things as joints and sinews, rocks, hard ground, or
gnarled tree-trunks, &amp;c. In figure drawing it is an interesting
quality to use sparingly, with the shading done on the
across-the-form principle; and to suggest a difference of texture
or a straining of the form. Lines of shading drawn in every
direction, crossing each other and resolving themselves into tone
effects, suggest atmosphere and the absence of surface form. This
is more often used in the backgrounds of pen and ink work and is
seldom necessary in pencil or chalk drawing, as they are more
concerned with form than atmosphere. Pen and ink is more often used
for elaborate pictorial effects in illustration work, owing to the
ease with which it can be reproduced and printed; and it is
<a name='Page_102' id="Page_102"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>102</span>here that one more often finds this muddled
quality of line spots being used to fill up interstices and make
the tone even.</p>
<p>Speaking generally, <b>lines of shading drawn across the forms
suggest softness, lines drawn in curves fulness of form, lines
drawn down the forms hardness, and lines crossing in all directions
so that only a mystery of tone results, atmosphere</b>. And if
these four qualities of line be used judiciously, a great deal of
expressive power is added to your shading. And, as will be
explained in the next chapter, somewhat the same principle applies
to the direction of the swing of the brush in painting.</p>
<p>Shading lines should never be drawn backwards and forwards from
left to right (scribbled), except possibly where a mystery of
shadow is wanted and the lines are being crossed in every
direction; but never when lines are being used to express form.
They are not sufficiently under control, and also the little extra
thickness that occurs at the turn is a nuisance.</p>
<p>The crossing of lines in shading gives a more opaque look. This
is useful to suggest the opaque appearance of the darker passage
that occurs in that part of a shadow nearest the lights; and it is
sometimes used in the half tones also.</p>
<p>Draughtsmen vary very much in their treatment of hair, and
different qualities of hair require different treatment. The
particular beauty of it that belongs to point drawing is the swing
and flow of its lines. These are especially apparent in the lights.
In the shadows the flow of line often stops, to be replaced by a
mystery of shadow. So that a play of swinging lines alternating
with shadow passages, drawn like all the other shadows <a name='Page_103'
id="Page_103"></a><span class='pagenum'>103</span>with
parallel lines not following the form, is often effective, and
suggests the quality of hair in nature. The swinging lines should
vary in thickness along their course, getting darker as they pass
certain parts, and gradating into lighter lines at other parts
according to the effect desired. (See illustration, page 102

</div>
<p>To sum up, in the method of line drawing we are trying to
explain (the method employed for most of the drawings by the author
in this book) the lines of shading are made parallel in a direction
that comes easy to the hand, unless some quality in the form
suggests their following other directions. So that when you are in
doubt as to what direction they should follow, draw them on the
parallel principle. This preserves a unity in your work, and allows
the lines drawn in other directions for special reasons to tell
expressively.</p>
<p>As has already been explained, it is not sufficient in drawing
to concentrate the attention on copying accurately the visual
appearance of anything, important as the faculty of accurate
observation is. Form to be expressed must first be appreciated. And
here the science of teaching fails. "You can take a horse to the
fountain, but you cannot make him drink," and in art you can take
the student to the point of view from which things are to be
appreciated, but you cannot make him see. How, then, is this
appreciation of form to be developed? Simply by feeding.
Familiarise yourself with all the best examples of drawing you can
find, trying to see in nature the same qualities. Study the
splendid drawing by Puvis de Chavannes reproduced on page 104
[Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate22">Plate XXII</a>]. Note the
way the contours have been searched for expressive qualities. Look
how <a name='Page_104' id="Page_104"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>104</span>the expressive line of the back of the seated
figure has been "felt," the powerful expression of the upraised arm
with its right angle (see later page 155 [Transcribers Note:
<a href="#diagram12">Diagram XII</a>], chapter on line rhythm). And
then observe the different types of the two standing figures; the
practical vigour of the one and the soft grace of the other, and
how their contours have been studied to express this feeling,
&amp;c. There is a mine of knowledge to be unearthed in this
drawing.</p>
<p>There never was an age when such an amount of artistic food was
at the disposal of students. Cheap means of reproduction have
brought the treasures of the world's galleries and collections to
our very doors in convenient forms for a few pence. The danger is
not from starvation, but indigestion. Students are so surfeited
with good things that they often fail to digest any of them; but
rush on from one example to another, taking but snapshot views of
what is offered, until their natural powers of appreciation are in
a perfect whirlwind of confused ideas. What then is to be done? You
cannot avoid the good things that are hurled at you in these days,
but when you come across anything that strikes you as being a
particularly fine thing, feed deeply on it. Hang it up where you
will see it constantly; in your bedroom, for instance, where it
will entertain your sleepless hours, if you are unfortunate enough
to have any. You will probably like very indifferent drawings at
first, the pretty, the picturesque and the tricky will possibly
attract before the sublimity of finer things. But be quite honest
and feed on the best that you genuinely like, and when you have
thoroughly digested and comprehended that, you will weary of it and
long for something better, and so, gradually, <a name='Page_105'
id="Page_105"></a><span class='pagenum'>105</span>be led on to
appreciate the best you are capable of appreciating.</p>

</div>
<p>Before closing this chapter there are one or two points
connected with the drawing of a head that might be mentioned, as
students are not always sufficiently on the look out for them.</p>
<p>In our diagram on page 107 [Transcribers Note: <a href=
"#diagram06">Diagram VI</a>], let Fig. 1 represent a normal eye. At
Fig. 2 we have removed the skin and muscles and exposed the two
main structural features in the form of the eye, namely the bony
ring of the socket and the globe containing the lenses and retina.
Examining this opening, we find from A to B that it runs smoothly
into the bony prominence at the top of the nose, and that the rest
of the edge is sharp, and from point C to E quite free. It is at
point A, starting from a little hole, that the sharp edge begins;
and near this point the corner of the eye is situated: A, Figs. 1,
2, 3. From points A to F the bony edge of the opening is very near
the surface and should be looked for.</p>
<p>The next thing to note is the fact that the eyebrow at first
follows the upper edge of the bony opening from B to C, but that
from point C it crosses the free arch between C and D and soon
ends. So that considering the under side of the eyebrow, whereas
from point C towards B there is usually a cavernous hollow, from C
towards D there is a prominence. The character of eyes varies
greatly, and this effect is often modified by the fleshy fulness
that fills in the space between the eyelid and the brow, but some
indication of a change is almost always to be observed at a point
somewhere about C, and should be looked out for. Any bony
prominence from this point towards D <a name='Page_106' id=
"Page_106"></a><span class='pagenum'>106</span>should be carefully
constructed. Look out for the bone, therefore, between the points
CD and AF.</p>
<p>Never forget when painting an eye that what we call the white of
the eye is part of a sphere and will therefore have the light and
shade of a sphere. It will seldom be the same tone all over; if the
light is coming from the right, it will be in shade towards the
left and vice versa. Also the eyelids are bands of flesh placed on
this spherical surface. They will therefore partake of the
modelling of the sphere and not be the same tone all across. Note
particularly the sudden change of plane usually marked by a fold,
where the under eyelid meets the surface coming from the cheek
bone. The neglect to construct these planes of the under eyelid is
a very common fault in poorly painted eyes. Note also where the
upper eyelid comes against the flesh under the eyebrow (usually a
strongly marked fold) and the differences of planes that occur at
this juncture. In some eyes, when there is little loose flesh above
the eyelid, there is a deep hollow here, the eyelid running up
under the bony prominence, C D. This is an important structural
line, marking as it does the limit of the spherical surface of the
eyeball, on which surface the eyelids are placed.</p>
<p>Fig. 4 is a rough diagram of the direction it is usual for the
hairs forming the eyebrow to take. From A a few scant hairs start
radiating above the nose and quite suddenly reach their thickest
and strongest growth between B and E. They continue, still
following a slightly radiating course until D. These hairs are now
met by another lot, starting from above downwards, and growing
from. B to C. An eyebrow is considered by the draughtsman <a name=
'Page_108' id="Page_108"></a><span class='pagenum'>108</span> as a
tone of a certain shape and qualities of edge. And what interests
us here is to note the effect of this order of growth upon its
appearance as tone. The meeting of the strong growth of hair
upwards with the downward growth between points B and E creates
what is usually the darkest part of the eyebrow at this point. And
the coming together of the hairs towards D often makes another dark
part in this direction. The edge from C to B is nearly always a
soft one, the tone melting into the flesh, and this should be
looked out for, giving as it does a pretty variety to the run of
the line. Another thing that tends to make this edge soft is the
fact that a bony prominence is situated here and has usually a high
light upon it that crosses the eyebrow. From C to D you usually
find a sharper edge, the hairs running parallel to the line of the
eyebrow, while from D to B and A to B a softer boundary can be
looked for. The chief accent will generally be found at B, where a
dark mass often comes sharply against the tone of the forehead.</p>

<p>ILLUSTRATING SOME POINTS CONNECTED WITH THE EYES NOT ALWAYS
OBSERVED IN DRAWING A HEAD</p>
</div>
<p>The eyelashes do not count for much in drawing a head, except in
so far as they affect the tone impression. In the first place they
shade the white of the eye when the light is above, as is usually
the case. They are much thicker on the outer than on the inner side
of the eyelids, and have a tendency to grow in an outward
direction, so that when the light comes from the left, as is shown
by arrow, Fig. 5, the white of the eye at A1 will not be much
shaded, and the light tone will run nearly up to the top. But at
B4, which should be the light side of this eye, the thick crop of
eyelashes will shade it somewhat and the light will not <a name=
'Page_109' id="Page_109"></a><span class='pagenum'>109</span>run
far up in consequence, while B3, A2 will be in the shade from the
turning away from the direction of the light of the spherical
surface of the whites of the eyes.</p>
<p>These may seem small points to mention, but the observance of
such small points makes a great difference to the construction of a
head.</p>
<p>Fig. 6 gives a series of blocks all exactly alike in outline,
with lines showing how the different actions of the head affect the
guide lines on which the features hang; and how these actions can
be suggested even when the contours are not varied. These archings
over should be carefully looked out for when the head is in any but
a simple full face position.</p>

<h2>IX<br />
MASS DRAWING: PRACTICAL</h2>
<p>This is the form of drawing with which painting in the oil
medium is properly concerned. The distinction between drawing and
painting that is sometimes made is a wrong one in so far as it
conveys any idea of painting being distinct from drawing. Painting
is drawing (<i>i.e.</i> the expression of form) with the added
complication of colour and tone. And with a brush full of paint as
your tool, some form of mass drawing must be adopted, so that at
the same time that the student is progressing with line drawing, he
should begin to accustom, himself to this other method of seeing,
by attempting very simple exercises in drawing with the brush.</p>
<p>Most objects can be reduced broadly into three tone masses, the
lights (including the high lights), the half tones, and the
shadows. And the habit of reducing things into a simple equation of
three tones as a foundation on which to build complex appearances
should early be sought for.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Exercise in Mass Drawing.</div>
<p>Here is a simple exercise in mass drawing with the brush that
is, as far as I know, never offered to the young student. Select a
simple object: some of those casts of fruit hanging up that are
common in art schools will do. Place it in a strong light and
shade, preferably by artificial light, as it is not so subtle, and
therefore easier; the <a name='Page_111' id=
"Page_111"></a><span class='pagenum'>111</span>light coming from
either the right or left hand, but not from in front. Try and
arrange it so that the tone of the ground of your cast comes about
equal to the half tones in the relief.</p>

</div>
<p>First draw in the outlines of the <b>masses</b> strongly in
charcoal, noting the shapes of the shadows carefully, taking great
care that you get their shapes blocked out in square lines in true
proportion relative to each other, and troubling about little else.
Let this be a setting out of the ground upon which you will
afterwards express the form, rather than a drawing&mdash;the same
scaffolding, in fact, that you were advised to do in the case of a
line drawing, only, in that case, the drawing proper was to be done
with a point, and in this case the drawing proper is to be done
with a brush full of paint. Fix the charcoal <b>well</b> with a
spray diffuser and the usual solution of white shellac in spirits
of wine.</p>
<p>Taking raw umber and white (oil paint), mix up a tone that you
think equal to the half tones of the cast before you. Extreme care
should be taken in matching this tone. Now scumble this with a big
brush equally over the whole canvas (or whatever you are making
your study on). Don't use much medium, but if it is too stiff to go
on thinly enough, put a little oil with it, but no turpentine. By
scumbling is meant rubbing the colour into the canvas, working the
brush from side to side rapidly, and laying just the <b>thinnest
solid tone</b> that will cover the surface. If this is properly
done, and your drawing was well fixed, you will just be able to see
it through the paint. Now mix up a tone equal to the highest lights
on the cast, and map out simply the shapes of the light masses on
your study, leaving the <a name='Page_112' id=
"Page_112"></a><span class='pagenum'>112</span>scumbled tone for
the half tones. Note carefully where the light masses come sharply
against the half tones and where they merge softly into them.</p>
<p>You will find that the scumbled tone of your ground will mix
with the tone of the lights with which you are painting, and darken
it somewhat. This will enable you to get the amount of variety you
want in the tone of the lights. The thicker you paint the lighter
will be the tone, while the thinner paint will be more affected by
the original half tone, and will consequently be darker. When this
is done, mix up a tone equal to the darkest shadow, and proceed to
map out the shadows in the same way as you did the lights; noting
carefully where they come sharply against the half tone and where
they are lost. In the case of the shadows the thicker you paint the
darker will be the tone; and the thinner, the lighter.</p>
<p>When the lights and shadows have been mapped out, if this has
been done with any accuracy, your work should be well advanced. And
it now remains to correct and refine it here and there, as you feel
it wants it. Place your work alongside the cast, and walk back to
correct it. Faults that are not apparent when close, are easily
seen at a little distance.</p>
<p>I don't suggest that this is the right or only way of painting,
but I do suggest that exercises of this description will teach the
student many of the rudimentary essentials of painting, such
elementary things as how to lay a tone, how to manage a brush, how
to resolve appearances into a simple structure of tones, and how to
manipulate your paint so as to express the desired shape. This
elementary paint drawing is, as far as I know, never <a name='Page_113'
id="Page_113"></a><span class='pagenum'>113</span>given
as an exercise, the study of drawing at present being confined to
paper and charcoal or chalk mediums. Drawing in charcoal is the
nearest thing to this "paint drawing," it being a sort of mixed
method, half line and half mass drawing. But although allied to
painting, it is a very different thing from expressing form with
paint, and no substitute for some elementary exercise with the
brush. The use of charcoal to the neglect of line drawing often
gets the student into a sloppy manner of work, and is not so good a
training to the eye and hand in clear, definite statement. Its
popularity is no doubt due to the fact that you can get much effect
with little knowledge. Although this painting into a middle tone is
not by any means the only method of painting, I do feel that it is
the best method for studying form expression with the brush.</p>
<p>But, when you come to colour, the fact of the opaque middle tone
(or half tone) being first painted over the whole will spoil the
clearness and transparency of your shadows, and may also interfere
with the brilliancy of the colour in the lights. When colour comes
to be considered it may be necessary to adopt many expedients that
it is as well not to trouble too much about until a further stage
is reached. But there is no necessity for the half tone to be
painted over the shadows. In working in colour the half tone or
middle tone of the lights can be made, and a middle tone of the
shadows, and these two first painted separately, the edges where
they come together being carefully studied and finished. Afterwards
the variety of tone in the lights and the shadows can be added. By
this means the difference in the quality of the colour between
<a name='Page_114' id="Page_114"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>114</span>lights and shadows is preserved. This is an
important consideration, as there is generally a strong contrast
between them, the shadows usually being warm if the lights are cool
and vice versa; and such contrasts greatly affect the vitality of
colouring.</p>
<p>Try always to do as much as possible with one stroke of the
brush; paint has a vitality when the touches are deft, that much
handling and continual touching kills. Look carefully at the shape
and variety of the tone you wish to express, and try and manipulate
the swing of your brush in such a way as to get in one touch as
near the quality of shape and gradation you want. Remember that the
lightest part of your touch will be where the brush first touches
the canvas when you are painting lights into a middle tone; and
that as the amount of paint in the brush gets less, so the tone
will be more affected by what you are painting into, and get
darker. And in painting the shadows, the darkest part of your
stroke will be where the brush first touches the canvas; and it
will gradually lighten as the paint in your brush gets less and
therefore more affected by the tone you are painting into. If your
brush is very full it will not be influenced nearly so much. And if
one wants a touch that shall be distinct, as would be the case in
painting the shiny light on a glazed pot, a very full brush would
be used. But generally speaking, get your effects with as little
paint as possible. Thinner paint is easier to refine and
manipulate. There will be no fear of its not being solid if you are
painting into a solidly scumbled middle tone.</p>

complicate the problem too much, and therefore to leave this until
later on, when you are competent to attack problems of colour. Keep

but as thin as you can, reserving thicker paint for those occasions

<p>Plate XXV.</p>
<p>ILLUSTRATING SOME TYPICAL BRUSH STROKES MADE WITH FOUR CLASSES
OF BRUSH</p>
<p>Class A, round; Class B, flat; Class C, full flat brush with
rounded corners; Class D, filbert shape.</p>
</div>
<p>It will perhaps be as well to illustrate a few of the different
brush strokes, and say something about the different qualities of
each. These are only given as typical examples of the innumerable
ways a brush may be used as an aid to very elementary students;
every artist will, of course, develop ways of his own.</p>
<p>The touch will of necessity depend in the first instance upon
the shape of the brush, and these shapes are innumerable. But there
are two classes into which they can roughly be divided, flat and
round. The round brushes usually sold, which we will call Class A,
have rather a sharp point, and this, although helpful in certain
circumstances, is against their general usefulness. But a round
brush with a round point is also made, and this is much more
convenient for mass drawing. Where there is a sharp point the
central hairs are much longer, and consequently when the brush is
drawn along and pressed so that all the hairs are touching the
canvas, the pressure in the centre, where the long hairs are
situated, is different from that at the sides. This has the effect
of giving a touch that is not equal in quality all across, and the
variety thus given is difficult to manipulate. I should therefore
advise the student to try the blunt-ended round brushes first, as
they give a <a name='Page_116' id="Page_116"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>116</span>much more even touch, and one much more suited
to painting in planes of tone.</p>
<p>The most extreme flat brushes (Class B) are thin and rather
short, with sharp square ends, and have been very popular with
students. They can be relied upon to give a perfectly flat, even
tone, but with a rather hard sharp edge at the sides, and also at
the commencement of the touch. In fact, they make touches like
little square bricks. But as the variety that can be got out of
them is limited, and the amount of paint they can carry so small
that only short strokes can be made, they are not the best brush
for general use. They are at times, when great refinement and
delicacy are wanted, very useful, but are, on the whole, poor tools
for the draughtsman in paint. Some variety can be got by using one
or other of their sharp corners, by which means the smallest
possible touch can be made to begin with, which can be increased in
size as more pressure is brought to bear, until the whole surface
of the brush is brought into play. They are also often used to
paint across the form, a manner illustrated in the second touch,
columns 1 and 2 of the illustration on page 114 [Transcribers Note:
<a href="#plate26">Plate XXVI</a>].</p>
<p>A more useful brush (Class C) partakes of the qualities of both
flat and round. It is made with much more hair than the last, is
longer, and has a square top with rounded corners. This brush
carries plenty of paint, will lay an even tone, and, from the fact
that the corners are rounded and the pressure consequently lessened
at the sides, does not leave so hard an edge on either side of your
stroke.</p>
<p>Another brush that has recently come into fashion is called a
filbert shape (Class D) by the makers. It is a fine brush to draw
with, as being <a name='Page_117' id="Page_117"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>117</span>flat it paints in planes, and having a rounded
top is capable of getting in and out of a variety of contours. They
vary in shape, some being more pointed than others. The blunt-ended
form is the best for general use. Either this class of brush or
Class C are perhaps the best for the exercises in mass drawing we
have been describing. But Class A should also be tried, and even
Class B, to find out which suits the particular individuality of
the student.</p>
<p>On page 114 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate26">Plate
XXVI</a>] a variety of touches have been made in turn by these
different shaped brushes.</p>
<p>In all the strokes illustrated it is assumed that the brush is
moderately full of paint of a consistency a little thinner than
that usually put up by colourmen. To thin it, mix a little
turpentine and linseed oil in equal parts with it; and get it into
easy working consistency before beginning your work, so as not to
need any medium.</p>
<p>In the first column (No. 1), a touch firmly painted with an
equal pressure all along its course is given. This gives you a
plane of tone with firm edges the width of your brush, getting
gradually darker or lighter as your brush empties, according to the
length of the stroke and to whether you are painting into a lighter
or darker ground.</p>
<p>In column No. 2 a drag touch is illustrated. This is a very
useful one. The brush is placed firmly on the canvas and then
dragged from the point lightly away, leaving a gradated tone. A
great deal of the modelling in round objects is to be expressed by
this variety of handling. The danger is that its use is apt to lead
to a too dexterous manner of painting; a dexterity more concerned
with the clever manner in which a thing is painted than with the
truth expressed.</p>
<p><a name='Page_118' id="Page_118"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>118</span>Column No. 3. This is a stroke lightly and
quickly painted, where the brush just grazes the surface of the
canvas. The paint is put on in a manner that is very brilliant, and
at the same time of a soft quality. If the brush is only moderately
full, such touches will not have any hard edges, but be of a light,
feathery nature. It is a most useful manner of putting on paint
when freshness of colour is wanted, as it prevents one tone being
churned up with another and losing its purity. And in the painting
of hair, where the tones need to be kept very separate, and at the
same time not hard, it is very useful. But in monochrome painting
from the cast it is of very little service.</p>
<p>Another method of using a brush is hatching, the drawing of rows
of parallel lines in either equal or varying thicknesses. This
method will lighten or darken a tone in varying degree, according
to whether the lines are thick, thin, or gradated&mdash;somewhat in
the same way that lines of shading are drawn in line work. In cases
where the correction of intricate modelling is desired and where it
would be very difficult to alter a part accurately by a deft stroke
of the brush, this method is useful to employ. A dry brush can be
drawn across the lines to unite them with the rest of the work
afterwards. This method of painting has lately been much used by
those artists who have attempted painting in separate, pure
colours, after the so-called manner of Claude Monet, although so
mechanical a method is seldom used by that master.</p>
<p>As your power of drawing increases (from the line drawing you
have been doing), casts of hands and heads should be attempted in
the same manner as has been described. Illustrations are given of
<a name='Page_119' id="Page_119"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>119</span>exercises of this description on pages 110 and
122. Unfortunately the photographs, which were taken from the same
study at different stages during the painting, are not all alike,
the first painting of the lights being too darkly printed in some
cases. But they show how much can be expressed with the one tone,
when variety is got by using the middle tone to paint into. The two
tones used are noted in the right-hand lower corner.</p>
<p>Try to train yourself to do these studies at one sitting. But if
you find you cannot manage this, use slower drying colours, say
bone brown and zinc white, which will keep wet until the next
day.</p>
<p>When you begin studying from the life, proceed in the same way
with monochrome studies painted into a middle tone.</p>
<p>And what are you to do if you find, when you have finished, that
it is all wrong? I should advise you to let it dry, and then
scumble a middle tone right over the whole thing, as you did at
first, which will show the old work through, and you can then
correct your drawing and proceed to paint the lights and shadows as
before. And if only a part of it is wrong, when it is quite dry rub
a little, poppy oil thinned with turpentine over the work, as
little as will serve to cover the surface. If it is found difficult
to get it to cover, breathe on the canvas, the slightest moisture
will help it to bite. When this is done, wipe it off with the palm
of your hand or an old piece of clean linen. Now paint a middle
tone right over the part you wish to retouch, being careful about
joining it up to the surrounding work, and proceed as before,
drawing in the light and shadow masses.</p>
<p>This form of drawing you will probably find more difficult at
first. For the reason already explained <a name='Page_120' id=
"Page_120"></a><span class='pagenum'>120</span>it seems natural to
observe objects as made up of outlines, not masses. The frame with
cottons across it should be used to flatten the appearance, as in
making outline drawings. And besides this a black glass should be
used. This can easily be made by getting a small piece of
glass&mdash;a photographic negative will do&mdash;and sticking some
black paper on the back; turning it over the front to keep the raw
edges of the glass from cutting the fingers. Or the glass can be
painted on the back with black paint. Standing with your back to
the object and your painting, hold this glass close in front of one
of your eyes (the other being closed), so that you can see both
your painting and the object. Seeing the tones thus reduced and
simplified, you will be enabled more easily to correct your
work.</p>
<p>I should like to emphasise the importance of the setting-out
work necessary for brush-drawing. While it is not necessary to put
expressive work into this preparatory work, the utmost care should
be taken to ensure its accuracy as far as it goes. It is a great
nuisance if, after you have put up some of your fair structure, you
find the foundations are in the wrong place and the whole thing has
to be torn down and shifted. It is of the utmost necessity to have
the proportions and the main masses settled at this early stage,
and every device of blocking out with square lines and measuring
with your knitting-needle, &amp;c., should be adopted to ensure the
accuracy of these large proportions. The variations and emphases
that feeling may dictate can be done in the painting stage. This
initial stage is not really a drawing at all, but a species of
mapping out, and as such it should be regarded. The only excuse for
making the elaborate preparatory drawings on <a name='Page_121' id=
"Page_121"></a><span class='pagenum'>121</span>canvas students
sometimes do, is that it enables them to learn the subject, so that
when they come to paint it, they already know something about it.
But the danger of making these preparatory drawings interesting is
that the student fears to cover them up and lose an outline so
carefully and lovingly wrought; and this always results in a poor
painting. When you take up a brush to express yourself, it must be
with no fear of hurting a careful drawing. Your drawing is going to
be done with the brush, and only the general setting out of the
masses will be of any use to you in the work of this initial stage.
Never paint with the poor spirit of the student who fears to lose
his drawing, or you will never do any fine things in painting.
Drawing (expressing form) is the thing you should be doing all the
time. And in art, "he that would save his work must often lose it,"
if you will excuse the paraphrase of a profound saying which, like
most profound sayings, is applicable to many things in life besides
what it originally referred to. It is often necessary when a
painting is <b>nearly</b> right to destroy the whole thing in order
to accomplish the apparently little that still divides it from what
you conceive it should be. It is like a man rushing a hill that is
just beyond the power of his motor-car to climb, he must take a
long run at it. And if the first attempt lands him nearly up at the
top but not <b>quite</b>, he has to go back and take the long run
all over again, to give him the impetus that shall carry him right
through.</p>
<p>Another method of judging tone drawing is our old method of half
closing the eyes. This, by lowering the tone and widening the
focus, enables you to correct the work more easily.</p>
<p>In tone drawing there is not only the shape of <a name='Page_122'
id="Page_122"></a><span class='pagenum'>122</span>the
masses to be considered, but their values&mdash;that is, their
position in an imagined scale from dark to light. The relation of
the different tones in this way&mdash;the values, as it is
called&mdash;is an extremely important matter in painting. But it
more properly belongs to the other department of the subject,
namely Colour, and this needs a volume to itself. But something
more will be said on this subject when treating of Rhythm.</p>
<p>We saw, in speaking of line drawing, how the character of a line
was found by observing its flatnesses and its relation to straight
lines. In the same way <b>the character of modelling is found by
observing its planes</b>. So that in building up a complicated
piece of form, like a head or figure, the planes (or flat tones)
should be sought for everywhere. As a carver in stone blocks out
his work in square surfaces, the modelling of a figure or any
complex surface that is being studied should be set out in planes
of tone, painting in the first instance the larger ones, and then,
to these, adding the smaller; when it will be seen that the
roundnesses have, with a little fusing of edges here and there,
been arrived at. Good modelling is full of these planes subtly
fused together. Nothing is so characteristic of bad modelling as
"gross roundnesses." The surface of a sphere is the surface with
the least character, like the curve of a circle, and the one most
to be avoided in good modelling.</p>
<p>In the search for form the knowledge of anatomy, and
particularly the bony structures, is of the utmost importance.
During the rage for realism and naturalism many hard things were
said about the study of anatomy. And certainly, were it to be used
to overstep the modesty of nature in these <a name='Page_123' id=
"Page_123"></a><span class='pagenum'>123</span>respects and to be
paraded to the exclusion of the charm and character of life, it
would be as well left alone. But if we are to make a drawing that
shall express something concrete, we must know something of its
structure, whatever it is. In the case of the human figure it is
impossible properly to understand its action and draw it in a way
that shall give a powerful impression without a knowledge of the
mechanics of its construction. But I hardly think the case for
anatomy needs much stating at the present time. Never let
anatomical knowledge tempt you into exaggerated statements of
internal structure, unless such exaggeration helps the particular
thing you wish to express. In drawing a figure in violent action it
might, for instance, be essential to the drawing, whereas in
drawing a figure at rest or a portrait, it would certainly be out
of place.</p>

<p>In the chapter on line work it was stated that: "Lines of
shading drawn across the forms suggest softness, lines drawn in
curves fulness of form, lines drawn down the forms hardness, and
lines crossing in every direction atmosphere," and these rules
apply equally well to the direction of the brush strokes (the brush
work) in a painting.</p>
<p><b>The brush swinging round the forms suggests fore-shortening,
and fulness of form generally, and across the forms softness, while
the brush following down the forms suggests toughness and hardness,
and crossing in every direction atmosphere</b>. A great deal of
added force can be given to form expression in this way. In the
foreshortened figure on the ground at the left of Tintoretto's
"Finding of the Body of St. Mark," the foreshortened effect helped
by the brush work swinging round can be seen (see illustration,
<a name='Page_124' id="Page_124"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>124</span>page 236 [Transcribers Note: <a href=
"#plate49">Plate XLIX</a>]). The work of Henner in France is an
extreme instance of the quality of softness and fleshiness got by
painting across the form. The look of toughness and hardness given
by the brush work following down the forms is well illustrated in
much of the work of James Ward, the animal painter. In his picture
in the National Gallery, "Harlech Castle," No. 1158, this can be
seen in the painting of the tree-trunks, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The crossing of the brush work in every direction, giving a look
of atmosphere, is naturally often used in painting backgrounds and
also such things as the plane surfaces of sky and mist, &amp;c.</p>
<p>It is often inconvenient to paint across the form when softness
is wanted. It is only possible to have one colour in your brush
sweep, and the colour changes across, much more than down the form
as a rule. For the shadows, half tones and lights, besides varying
in tone, vary also in colour; so that it is not always possible to
sweep across them with one colour. It is usually more convenient to
paint down where the colours can be laid in overlapping bands of
shadow, half tone and light, &amp;c. Nevertheless, if this
particular look of softness and fleshiness is desired, either the
painting must be so thin or the tones so fused together that no
brush strokes show, or a dry flat brush must afterwards be drawn
lightly across when the painting is done, to destroy the downward
brush strokes and substitute others going across, great care being
taken to drag only from light to dark, and to wipe the brush
carefully after each touch; and also never to go over the same
place twice, or the paint will lose vitality. This is a method much
employed by artists who delight in this particular quality.</p>
<p><a name='Page_125' id="Page_125"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>125</span>But when a strong, tough look is desired, such
as one sees when a muscle is in violent action, or in the tendon
above the wrist or above the heel in the leg, or generally where a
bone comes to the surface, in all these cases the brush work should
follow down the forms. It is not necessary and is often inadvisable
for the brush work to show at all, in which case these principles
will be of little account. But when in vigorously painted work they
do, I think it will generally be found to create the effects
named.</p>
<p>Drawing on toned paper with white chalk or Chinese white and
black or red chalk is another form of mass drawing. And for studies
it is intended to paint from, this is a quick and excellent manner.
The rapidity with which the facts of an appearance can be noted
makes it above all others the method for drapery studies. The
lights are drawn with white, the toned paper being allowed to show
through where a darker tone is needed, the white (either chalk or
Chinese white) being put on thickly when a bright light is wanted
and thinly where a quieter light is needed. So with the shadows,
the chalk is put on heavily in the darks and less heavily in the
lighter shadows. Since the days of the early Italians this has been
a favourite method of drawing drapery studies (see illustrations,
page 260 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate54">Plate
LIV</a>]).</p>
<p>Some artists have shaded their lights with gold and silver
paint. The late Sir Edward Burne-Jones was very fond of this, and
drawings with much decorative charm have been done this way. The
principle is the same as in drawing with white chalk, the half tone
being given by the paper.</p>
<p>Keep the lights separate from the shadows, let <a name=
'Page_126' id="Page_126"></a><span class='pagenum'>126</span>the
half tone paper always come as a buffer state between them. Get as
much information into the drawing of your lights and shadows as
possible; don't be satisfied with a smudge effect. Use the side of
your white chalk when you want a mass, or work in parallel lines
(hatching) on the principle described in the chapter on line
drawing.</p>

<h2>X<br />
RHYTHM</h2>
<p>The subject of Rhythm in what are called the Fine Arts is so
vague, and has received so little attention, that some courage, or
perhaps foolhardiness, is needed to attack it. And in offering the
following fragmentary ideas that have been stumbled on in my own
limited practice, I want them to be accepted only for what they are
worth, as I do not know of any proper authority for them. But they
may serve as a stimulus, and offer some lines on which the student
can pursue the subject for himself.</p>
<p>The word rhythm is here used to signify the power possessed by
lines, tones, and colours, by their ordering and arrangement, to
affect us, somewhat as different notes and combinations of sound do
in music. And just as in music, where sounds affect us without
having any direct relation with nature, but appeal directly to our
own inner life; so in painting, sculpture, and architecture
<b>there is a music that appeals directly to us apart from any
significance that may be associated with the representation of
natural phenomena</b>. There is, as it were, an abstract music of
line, tone, and colour.</p>
<p>The danger of the naturalistic movement in painting in the
nineteenth century has been that it has turned our attention away
from this fundamental fact of art to the contemplation of
interesting <a name='Page_128' id="Page_128"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>128</span>realisations of appearances&mdash;realisations
often full of poetic suggestiveness due to associations connected
with the objects painted as concrete things, but not always made
directly significant as artistic expression; whereas <b>it is the
business of the artist to relate the form, colour, and tone of
natural appearances to this abstract musical quality, with which he
should never lose touch even in the most highly realised detail of
his work</b>. For only thus, when related to rhythm, do the form,
tone, and colour of appearances obtain their full expressive power
and become a means of vitally conveying the feeling of the
artist.</p>
<p>Inquiry as to the origin of this power and of rhythm generally
is a profoundly interesting subject; and now that recent advances
in science tend to show that sound, heat, light, and possibly
electricity and even nerve force are but different rhythmic forms
of energy, and that matter itself may possibly be resolved
eventually into different rhythmic motions, it does look as if
rhythm may yet be found to contain even the secret of life itself.
At any rate it is very intimately associated with life; and
primitive man early began to give expression in some form of
architecture, sculpture, or painting to the deeper feelings that
were moving him; found some correspondence between the lines and
colours of architecture, sculpture, and painting and the emotional
life that was awakening within him. Thus, looking back at the
remains of their work that have come down to us, we are enabled to
judge of the nature of the people from the expression we find in
hewn stone and on painted walls.</p>
<p>It is in primitive art generally that we see more clearly the
direct emotional significance of line and <a name='Page_129' id=
"Page_129"></a><span class='pagenum'>129</span>form. Art appears to
have developed from its most abstract position, to which bit by bit
have been added the truths and graces of natural appearance, until
as much of this naturalistic truth has been added as the abstract
significance at the base of the expression could stand without loss
of power. At this point, as has already been explained, a school is
at the height of its development. The work after this usually shows
an increased concern with naturalistic truth, which is always very
popular, to the gradual exclusion of the backbone of abstract line
and form significance that dominated the earlier work. And when
these primitive conditions are lost touch with, a decadence sets
in. At least, this is roughly the theory to which a study of the
two great art developments of the past, in Greece and Italy, would
seem to point. And this theory is the excuse for all the attempts
at primitivism of which we have lately seen so much.</p>
<p>Art having lost touch with its primitive base owing to the
over-doses of naturalism it has had, we must, these new apostles
say, find a new primitive base on which to build the new structure
of art. The theory has its attractions, but there is this
difference between the primitive archaic Greek or early Italian and
the modern primitive; the early men reverently clothed the abstract
idea they started with in the most natural and beautiful form
within their knowledge, ever seeking to discover new truths and
graces from nature to enrich their work; while the modern artist,
with the art treasures of all periods of the world before him, can
never be in the position of these simple-minded men. It is
therefore unlikely that the future development of art will be on
lines similar to that of the past. <a name='Page_130' id=
"Page_130"></a><span class='pagenum'>130</span>The same conditions
of simple ignorance are never likely to occur again. Means of
communication and prolific reproduction make it very unlikely that
the art of the world will again be lost for a season, as was Greek
art in the Middle Ages. Interesting intellectually as is the theory
that the impressionist point of view (the accepting of the flat
retina picture as a pattern of colour sensations) offers a new
field from which to select material for a new basis of artistic
expression, so far the evidence of results has not shown anything
likely seriously to threaten the established principles of
traditional design. And anything more different in spirit from the
genuine primitive than the irreverent anarchy and flouting of all
refinement in the work of some of these new primitives, it would be
difficult to imagine. But much of the work of the movement has
undoubted artistic vitality, and in its insistence on design and
selection should do much to kill "realism" and the "copying nature"
theory of a few years back.</p>
<p>Although it is perfectly true that the feelings and ideas that
impel the artist may sooner or later find their own expression,
there are a great many principles connected with the arranging of
lines, tones, and colours in his picture that it is difficult to
transgress without calamity. At any rate the knowledge of some of
them will aid the artist in gaining experience, and possibly save
him some needless fumbling.</p>
<p>But don't for one moment think that anything in the nature of
rules is going to take the place of the initial artistic impulse
which must come from within. This is not a matter for teaching, art
training being only concerned with perfecting the means of its
expression.</p>

<p>It is proposed to treat the subject from the material side of
line and tone only, without any reference to subject matter, with
the idea of trying to find out something about the expressive
qualities line and tone are capable of yielding unassociated with
visual things. What use can be made of any such knowledge to give
expression to the emotional life of the artist is not our concern,
and is obviously a matter for the individual to decide for
himself.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>There is at the basis of every picture a structure of lines and
masses. They may not be very obvious, and may be hidden under the
most broken of techniques, but they will always be found underlying
the planning of any painting. Some may say that the lines are only
the boundaries of the masses, and others that the masses are only
the spaces between the lines. But whichever way you care to look at
it, there are particular emotional qualities analogous to music
that affect us in lines and line arrangements and also in tone or
mass arrangements. And any power a picture may have to move us will
be largely due to the rhythmic significance of this original
planning. These qualities, as has already been stated, affect us
quite apart from any association they may have with natural things:
arrangements of mere geometrical lines are sufficient to suggest
them. But of course other associations connected with the objects
represented will largely augment the impression, when the line and
tone arrangements and the sentiment of the object are in sympathy.
And if they are not, it may happen that associations connected with
the representation will cut in and obscure or entirely destroy this
line and tone music. That is to say, <a name='Page_132' id=
"Page_132"></a><span class='pagenum'>132</span>if the line and tone
arrangement in the abstract is expressive of the sublime, and the
objects whose representation they support something ridiculous, say
a donkey braying, the associations aroused by so ridiculous an
appearance will override those connected with the line and tone
arrangement. But it is remarkable how seldom this occurs in nature,
the sentiment of the line and tone arrangements things present
being usually in harmony with the sentiment of the object itself.
As a matter of fact, the line effect of a donkey in repose is much
more sublime than when he is braying.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Unity and Variety.</div>
<p>There are two qualities that may be allowed to divide the
consideration of this subject, two points of view from which the
subject can be approached: <b>Unity</b> and <b>Variety</b>,
qualities somewhat opposed to each other, as are harmony and
contrast in the realm of colour. Unity is concerned with the
relationship of all the parts to that oneness of conception that
should control every detail of a work of art. All the more profound
qualities, the deeper emotional notes, are on this side of the
subject. On the other hand, variety holds the secrets of charm,
vitality, and the picturesque, it is the "dither," the play between
the larger parts, that makes for life and character. <b>Without
variety there can be no life</b>.</p>
<p>In any conception of a perfect unity, like the perfected life of
the Buddhist, Nirvana or Nibbana (literally "dying out" or
"extinction" as of an expiring fire), there is no room for variety,
for the play of life; all such fretfulness ceases, to be replaced
by an all-pervading calm, beautiful, if you like, but lifeless.
There is this deadness about any conception of perfection that will
always make it an unattainable <a name='Page_133' id=
"Page_133"></a><span class='pagenum'>133</span> ideal in life.
Those who, like the Indian fakir or the hermits of the Middle Ages,
have staked their all on this ideal of perfection, have found it
necessary to suppress life in every way possible, the fakirs often
remaining motionless for long periods at a time, and one of the
mediaeval saints going so far as to live on the top of a high
column where life and movement were well-nigh impossible.</p>
<p>And in art it is the same; all those who have aimed at an
absolute perfection have usually ended in a deadness. The Greeks
knew better than many of their imitators this vital necessity in
art. In their most ideal work there is always that variety that
gives character and life. No formula or canon of proportions or
other mechanical device for the attainment of perfection was
allowed by this vital people entirely to subdue their love of life
and variety. And however near they might go towards a perfect type
in their ideal heads and figures, they never went so far as to kill
the individual in the type. It is the lack of this subtle
distinction that, I think, has been the cause of the failure of so
much art founded on so-called Greek ideals. Much Roman sculpture,
if you except their portrait busts, illustrates this. Compared with
Greek work it lacks that subtle variety in the modelling that gives
vitality. The difference can be felt instinctively in the merest
fragment of a broken figure. It is not difficult to tell Greek from
Roman fragments, they pulsate with a life that it is impossible to
describe but that one instinctively feels. And this vitality
depends, I think it will be found, on the greater amount of
life-giving variety in the surfaces of the modelling. In their
architectural mouldings, the difference of which we are speaking
can be more easily traced. <a name='Page_134' id=
"Page_134"></a><span class='pagenum'>134</span>The vivacity and
brilliancy of a Greek moulding makes a Roman work look heavy and
dull. And it will generally be found that the Romans used the curve
of the circle in the sections of their mouldings, a curve
possessing the least amount of variety, as is explained later,
where the Greeks used the lines of conic sections, curves possessed
of the greatest amount of variety.</p>
<p>But while unity must never exist without this life-giving
variety, variety must always be under the moral control of unity,
or it will get out of hand and become extravagant. In fact, the
most perfect work, like the most perfect engine of which we spoke
in a former chapter, has the least amount of variety, as the engine
has the least amount of "dither," that is compatible with life. One
does not hear so much talk in these days about a perfect type as
was the fashion at one time; and certainly the pursuit of this
ideal by a process of selecting the best features from many models
and constructing a figure out of them as an ideal type, was
productive of very dead and lifeless work. No account was taken of
the variety from a common type necessary in the most perfect work,
if life and individual interest are not to be lost, and the thing
is not to become a dead abstraction. But the danger is rather the
other way at the moment. Artists revel in the oddest of individual
forms, and the type idea is flouted on all hands. An anarchy of
individualism is upon us, and the vitality of disordered variety is
more fashionable than the calm beauty of an ordered unity.</p>
<p>Excess of variations from a common type is what I think we
recognise as ugliness in the objective world, whereas beauty is on
the side of unity and conformity to type. Beauty possesses both
<a name='Page_135' id="Page_135"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>135</span>variety and unity, and is never extreme, erring
rather on the side of unity.</p>
<p>Burke in his essay on "The Sublime and the Beautiful" would seem
to use the word beautiful where we should use the word pretty,
placing it at the opposite pole from the sublime, whereas I think
beauty always has some elements of the sublime in it, while the
merely pretty has not. Mere prettiness is a little difficult to
place, it does not come between either of our extremes, possessing
little character or type, variety or unity. It is perhaps charm
without either of these strengthening associates, and in
consequence is always feeble, and the favourite diet of weak
artistic digestions.</p>
<p>The sculpture of ancient Egypt is an instance of great unity in
conception, and the suppression of variety to a point at which life
scarcely exists. The lines of the Egyptian figures are simple and
long, the surfaces smooth and unvaried, no action is allowed to
give variety to the pose, the placing of one foot a little in front
of the other being alone permitted in the standing figures; the
arms, when not hanging straight down the sides, are flexed stiffly
at the elbow at right angles; the heads stare straight before them.
The expression of sublimity is complete, and this was, of course,
what was aimed at. But how cold and terrible is the lack of that
play and variety that alone show life. What a relief it is, at the
British Museum, to go into the Elgin Marble room and be warmed by
the noble life pulsating in the Greek work, after visiting the cold
Egyptian rooms.</p>
<p>In what we call a perfect face it is not so much the perfect
regularity of shape and balance in the features that charms us, not
the things that belong to an ideal type, but rather the subtle
variations <a name='Page_136' id="Page_136"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>136</span>from this type that are individual to the
particular head we are admiring. A perfect type of head, if such
could exist, might excite our wonder, but would leave us cold. But
it can never exist in life; the slightest movement of the features,
which must always accompany life and expression, will mar it. And
the influence of these habitual movements on the form of the
features themselves will invariably mould them into individual
shapes away from the so-called perfect type, whatever may have been
nature's intention in the first instance.</p>
<p>If we call these variations from a common type in the features
imperfections, as it is usual to do, it would seem to be the
imperfections of perfection that charm and stir us; and that
perfection without these so-called imperfections is a cold, dead
abstraction, devoid of life: that unity without variety is lifeless
and incapable of touching us.</p>
<p>On the other hand, variety without unity to govern it is a
riotous exuberance of life, lacking all power and restraint and
wasting itself in a madness of excess.</p>
<p>So that in art a balance has to be struck between these two
opposing qualities. In good work unity is the dominating quality,
all the variety being done in conformity to some large idea of the
whole, which is never lost sight of, even in the smallest detail of
the work. Good style in art has been defined as "variety in unity,"
and Hogarth's definition of composition as the art of "varying
well" is similar. And I am not sure that "contrasts in harmony"
would not be a suggestive definition of good colour.</p>
<p>Let us consider first variety and unity as they are related to
line drawing, and afterwards to mass drawing.</p>

<h2>XI<br />
RHYTHM: VARIETY OF LINE</h2>
<p>Line rhythm or music depends on the shape of your lines, their
relation to each other and their relation to the boundaries of your
panel. In all good work this music of line is in harmony with the
subject (the artistic intention) of your picture or drawing.</p>
<p>The two lines with the least variation are a perfectly straight
line and a circle. A perfectly straight line has obviously no
variety at all, while a circle, by curving at exactly the same
ratio all along, has no variation of curvature, it is of all curves
the one with the least possible variety. These two lines are,
therefore, two of the dullest, and are seldom used in pictures
except to enhance the beauty and variety of others. And even then,
subtle variations, some amount of play, is introduced to relieve
their baldness. But used in this way, vertical and horizontal lines
are of the utmost value in rectangular pictures, uniting the
composition to its bounding lines by their parallel relationship
with them. And further, as a contrast to the richness and beauty of
curves they are of great value, and are constantly used for this
purpose. The group of mouldings cutting against the head in a
portrait, or the lines of a column used to accentuate the curved
forms of a face or <a name='Page_138' id=
"Page_138"></a><span class='pagenum'>138</span>figure, are
well-known instances; and the portrait painter is always on the
look out for an object in his background that will give him such
straight lines. You may notice, too, how the lines drawn across a
study in order to copy it (squaring it out, as it is called)
improve the look of a drawing, giving a greater beauty to the
variety of the curves by contrast with the variety lacking in
straight lines.</p>
<p>The perfect curve of the circle should always be avoided in the
drawing of natural objects (even a full moon), and in vital
drawings of any sort some variety should always be looked for.
Neither should the modelling of the sphere ever occur in your work,
the dullest of all curved surfaces.</p>
<p>Although the curve of the perfect circle is dull from its lack
of variety, it is not without beauty, and this is due to its
perfect unity. It is of all curves the most perfect example of
static unity. Without the excitement of the slightest variation it
goes on and on for ever. This is, no doubt, the reason why it was
early chosen as a symbol of Eternity, and certainly no more perfect
symbol could be found.</p>
<p>The circle seen in perspective assumes the more beautiful curve
of the ellipse, a curve having much variety; but as its four
quarters are alike, not so much as a symmetrical figure can
have.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most beautiful symmetrically curved figure of all is
the so-called egg of the well-known moulding from such a temple as
the Erechtheum, called the egg and dart moulding. Here we have a
perfect balance between variety and unity. The curvature is varied
to an infinite degree, at no point is its curving at the same ratio
as at any <a name='Page_139' id="Page_139"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>139</span>other point; perhaps the maximum amount of
variety that can be got in a symmetrical figure, preserving, as it
does, its almost perfect continuity, for it approaches the circle
in the even flow of its curvature. This is, roughly, the line of
the contour of a face, and you may note how much painters who have
excelled in grace have insisted on it in their portraits.
Gainsborough and Vandyke are striking, instances.</p>

<p>The line of a profile is often one of great beauty, only here
the variety is apt to overbalance the unity or run of the line. The
most beautiful profiles <a name='Page_140' id=
"Page_140"></a><span class='pagenum'>140</span>are usually those in
which variety is subordinated to the unity of the contour. I fancy
the Greeks felt this when they did away with the hollow above the
nose, making the line of the forehead run, with but little
interruption, to the tip of the nose. The unity of line is
increased, and the variety made more interesting. The idea that
this was the common Greek type is, I should imagine, untrue, for
their portrait statues do not show it. <a name='Page_141' id=
"Page_141"></a><span class='pagenum'>141</span>It does occur in
nature at rare intervals, and in most Western nationalities, but I
do not think there is much evidence of its ever having been a
common type anywhere.</p>

<p>Note how the hollows marked A are opposed by fullnesses marked

</div>
<p>In drawing or painting a profile this run or unity of the line
is the thing to feel, if you would express its particular beauty.
This is best done in the case of a painting by finally drawing it
with the brush from the background side, after having painted all
the variety there is of tone and colour on the face side of the
line. As the background usually varies little, the swing of the
brush is not hampered on this side as it is on the other. I have
seen students worried to distraction trying to paint the profile
line from the face side, fearing to lose the drawing by going over
the edge. With the edge blurred out from the face side, it is easy
to come with a brush full of the colour the background is
immediately against the face (a different colour usually from what
it is further away), and draw it with some decision and conviction,
care being taken to note all the variations on the edge, where the
sharpnesses come and where the edge is more lost, &amp;c.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Variety in Symmetry.</div>
<p>The contours of the limbs illustrate another form of line
variety&mdash;what may be called "Variety in Symmetry." While
roughly speaking the limbs are symmetrical, each side not only has
variety in itself, but there is usually variety of opposition.
Supposing there is a convex curve on the one side, you will often
have a concave form on the other. Always look out for this in
drawing limbs, and it will often improve a poorly drawn part if
more of this variation on symmetry is discovered.</p>
<p>The whole body, you may say, is symmetrical, <a name='Page_143'
id="Page_143"></a><span class='pagenum'>143</span>but even here
natural conditions make for variety. The body is seldom, except in
soldiering, held in a symmetrical position. The slightest action
produces the variety we are speaking about. The accompanying
sketches will indicate what is meant.</p>

</div>
<p>Of course the student, if he has any natural ability,
instinctively looks out for all these variations that give the play
of life to his drawing. It is not for him in the full vigour of
inspiration that books such as this are written. But there may come
a time when things "won't come," and it is then that it is useful
to know where to look for possible weak spots in your work.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Variety of Thickness and Accent.</div>
<p>A line of equal thickness is a very dead and inexpressive thing
compared with one varied and stressed at certain points. If you
observe any of the boundaries in nature we use a line to express,
you will notice some points are accentuated, attract the attention,
more than others. The only means you have to express this in a line
drawing is by darkening and sharpening the line. At other points,
where the contour is almost lost, the line can be soft and
blurred.</p>
<p>It is impossible to write of the infinite qualities of variety
that a fine draughtsman will get into his line work; they must be
studied first hand. But on this play of thickness and quality of
line much of the vitality of your drawing will depend.</p>

"Page_144"></a><span class='pagenum'>144</span>
<h2>XII<br />
RHYTHM: UNITY OF LINE</h2>
<p>Unity of line is a bigger quality than variety, and as it
requires a larger mental grasp, is more rarely met with. The bigger
things in drawing and design come under its consideration,
including, as it does, the relation of the parts to the whole. Its
proper consideration would take us into the whole field of
Composition, a subject needing far more consideration than it can
be given in this book.</p>
<p>In almost all compositions a rhythmic flow of lines can be
traced. Not necessarily a flow of actual lines (although these
often exist); they may be only imaginary lines linking up or
massing certain parts, and bringing them into conformity with the
rhythmic conception of the whole. Or again, only a certain stress
and flow in the forms, suggesting line movements. But these line
movements flowing through your panel are of the utmost importance;
they are like the melodies and subjects of a musical symphony,
weaving through and linking up the whole composition.</p>
<p>Often, the line of a contour at one part of a picture is picked
up again by the contour of some object at another part of the
composition, and although no actual line connects them, a unity is
thus set up between them. (See diagrams, pages 166 and 168,
illustrating line compositions of pictures <a name='Page_145' id=
"Page_145"></a><span class='pagenum'>145</span>by Botticelli and
Paolo Veronese). This imaginary following through of contours
across spaces in a composition should always be looked out for and
sought after, as nothing serves to unite a picture like this
relationship of remote parts. The flow of these lines will depend
on the nature of the subject: they will be more gracious and easy,
or more vigorous and powerful, according to the demands of your
subject.</p>
<p>This linking up of the contours applies equally well to the
drawing of a single figure or even a head or hand, and the student
should always be on the look out for this uniting quality. It is a
quality of great importance in giving unity to a composition.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Parallelism</div>
<p>When groups of lines in a picture occur parallel to each other
they produce an accentuation of the particular quality the line may
contain, a sort of sustained effect, like a sustained chord on an
organ, the effect of which is much bigger than that of the same
chord struck staccato. This sustained quality has a wonderful
influence in steadying and uniting your work.</p>
<p>This parallelism can only be used successfully with the simplest
lines, such as a straight line or a simple curve; it is never
advisable except in decorative patterns to be used with complicated
shapes. Blake is very fond of the sustained effect parallelism
gives, and uses the repetition of curved and straight lines very
often in his compositions. Note in Plate I of the Job series, page
146 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate31">Plate XXXI</a>], the use
made of this sustaining quality in the parallelism of the sheep's
backs in the background and the parallel upward flow of the lines
of the figures. In Plate II you see it used in the curved lines of
the figures on either side of <a name='Page_146' id=
"Page_146"></a><span class='pagenum'>146</span>the throne above,
and in the two angels with the scroll at the left-hand corner.
Behind these two figures you again have its use accentuating by
repetition the peaceful line of the hacks of the sheep. The same
thing can be seen in Plate XXXI, B, where the parallelism of the
back lines of the sheep and the legs of the seated figures gives a
look of peace contrasting with the violence of the messenger come
to tell of the destruction of Job's sons. The emphasis that
parallelism gives to the music of particular lines is well
illustrated in all Blake's work. He is a mine of information on the
subject of line rhythm. Compare A with Plate XXXI, C; note how the
emotional quality is dependent in both cases on the parallelism of
the upward flow of the lines. How also in Plate I he has carried
the vertical feeling even into the sheep in the front, introducing
little bands of vertical shading to carry through the vertical
lines made by the kneeling figures. And in the last plate, "So the
Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than the beginning," note
how the greater completeness with which the parallelism has been
carried out has given a much greater emphasis to the effect,
expressing a greater exaltation and peace than in Plate XXXI, A.
Notice in Plate XXXI, D, where "The just, upright man is laughed to
scorn," how this power of emphasis is used to increase the look of
scorn hurled at Job by the pointing fingers of his three
friends.</p>
<p>Of the use of this principle in curved forms, the repetition of
the line of the back in stooping figures is a favourite device with
Blake. There will be found instances of this in Plate XXXII, E and
G. (Further instances will be found on reference <a name='Page_147'
id="Page_147"></a><span class='pagenum'>147</span>to Plates VII,
VIII, XIII, and XVII, in Blake's Job.) In the last instance it is
interesting to note how he has balanced the composition, which has
three figures kneeling on the right and only one on the left. By
losing the outline of the third figure on the right and getting a
double line out of the single figure on the left by means of the
outline of the mass of hair, and also by shading this single figure
more strongly, he has contrived to keep a perfect balance. The head
of Job is also turned to the left, while he stands slightly on that
side, still further balancing the three figures on the right. (This
does not show so well in the illustration here reproduced as in the
original print.)</p>

</div>
<p>Some rude things were said above about the straight line and the
circle, on account of their lack of variety, and it is true that a
mathematically straight line, or a mathematically perfect circle,
are never found in good artistic drawing. For without variety is no
charm or life. But these lines possess other qualities, due to
their maximum amount of unity, that give them great power in a
composition; and where the expression of sublimity or any of the
deeper and more profound sentiments are in evidence, they are often
to be found.</p>
<p>The rows of columns in a Greek temple, the clusters of vertical
lines in a Gothic cathedral interior, are instances of the
sublimity and power they possess. The necessary play that makes for
vitality&mdash;the "dither" as we called this quality in a former
chapter&mdash;is given in the case of the Greek temple by the
subtle curving of the lines of columns and steps, and by the rich
variety of the sculpture, and in the case of the Gothic cathedral
by a rougher cutting of the stone blocks and the variety in the
<a name='Page_148' id="Page_148"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>148</span>colour of the stone. But generally speaking, in
Gothic architecture this particular quality of "dither" or the play
of life in all the parts is conspicuous, the balance being on the
side of variety rather than unity. The individual workman was given
a large amount of freedom and allowed to exercise his personal
fancy. The capitals of columns, the cusping of windows, and the
ornaments were seldom repeated, but varied according to the taste
of the craftsman. Very high finish was seldom attempted, the marks
of the chisel often being left showing in the stonework. All this
gave a warmth and exuberance of life to a fine Gothic building that
makes a classical building look cold by comparison. The freedom
with which new parts were built on to a Gothic building is another
proof of the fact that it is not in the conception of the unity of
the whole that their chief charm consists.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a fine classic building is the result of one
large conception to which every part has rigorously to conform. Any
addition to this in after years is usually disastrous. A high
finish is always attempted, no tool marks nor any individuality of
the craftsman is allowed to mar the perfect symmetry of the whole.
It may be colder, but how perfect in sublimity! The balance here is
on the side of unity rather than variety.</p>
<p>The strength and sublimity of Norman architecture is due to the
use of circular curves in the arches, combined with straight lines
and the use of square forms in the ornaments&mdash;lines possessed
of least variety.</p>
<p>All objects with which one associates the look of strength will
be found to have straight lines in their composition. The look of
strength in a strong <a name='Page_149' id=
"Page_149"></a><span class='pagenum'>149</span>man is due to the
square lines of the contours, so different from the rounded forms
of a fat man. And everyone knows the look of mental power a square
forehead gives to a head and the look of physical power expressed
by a square jaw. The look of power in a rocky landscape or range of
hills is due to the same cause.</p>

</div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Horizontal and the Vertical</div>
<p>The horizontal and the vertical are two very important lines,
the horizontal being associated with calm and contemplation and the
vertical with a feeling of elevation. As was said above, their
relation to the sides of the composition to which they are parallel
in rectangular pictures is of great importance in uniting the
subject to its bounding lines and giving it a well-knit look,
conveying a feeling of great stability to a picture.</p>
<p>How impressive and suggestive of contemplation is the long line
of the horizon on a calm day at sea, or the long, horizontal line
of a desert plain! The lack of variety, with all the energy and
vitality that accompany it, gives one a sense of peace and rest, a
touch of infinity that no other lines can convey. The horizontal
lines which the breeze makes on still water, and which the sky
often assumes at sunset, affect us from the same harmonic
cause.</p>
<p>The stone pine and the cypress are typical instances of the
sublime associated with the vertical in nature. Even a factory
chimney rising above a distant town, in spite of its unpleasant
associations, is impressive, not to speak of the beautiful spires
of some of our Gothic cathedrals, pointing upwards. How well
Constable has used the vertical sublimity of the spire of Salisbury
Cathedral can be seen in his picture, at the Victoria and Albert
Museum, where he has contrasted it with the gay tracery of an arch
<a name='Page_150' id="Page_150"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>150</span>of elm trees. Gothic cathedrals generally
depend much on this vertical feeling of line for their
impressiveness.</p>
<p>The Romans knew the expressive power of the vertical when they
set up a lonely column as a monument to some great deed or person.
And a sense of this sublimity may be an unconscious explanation of
the craze for putting towers and obelisks on high places that one
comes across in different parts of the country, usually called
someone's "folly."</p>
<p>In the accompanying diagrams, A, B, C and D, E, F, pages 152
[Transcribers Note: <a href="#diagram10">Diagram X</a>] and 153
[Transcribers Note: <a href="#diagram11">Diagram XI</a>], are
examples of the influence to be associated with the horizontal and
vertical lines. A is nothing but six straight lines drawn across a
rectangular shape, and yet I think they convey something of the
contemplative and peaceful sense given by a sunset over the sea on
a calm evening. And this is entirely due to the expressive power
straight lines possess, and the feelings they have the power to
call up in the mind. In B a little more incident and variety has
been introduced, and although there is a certain loss of calm, it
is not yet enough to destroy the impression. The line suggesting a
figure is vertical and so plays up to the same calm feeling as the
horizontal lines. The circular disc of the sun has the same static
quality, being the curve most devoid of variety. It is the lines of
the clouds that give some excitement, but they are only enough to
suggest the dying energy of departing day.</p>
<p>Now let us but bend the figure in a slight curve, as at C, and
destroy its vertical direction, partly cover the disc of the sun so
as to destroy the complete circle, and all this is immediately
altered, our <a name='Page_151' id="Page_151"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>151</span>calm evening has become a windy one, our lines
now being expressive of some energy.</p>

<p>Note the straight line introduced in seated female figure with

</div>
<p>To take a similar instance with vertical lines. Let D represent
a row of pine trees in a wide plain. Such lines convey a sense of
exaltation and infinite calm. Now if some foliage is introduced, as
at E, giving a swinging line, and if this swinging line is carried
on by a corresponding one in the sky, we have introduced some life
and variety. If we entirely destroy the vertical feeling and bend
our trees, as at F, the expression of much energy will be the
result, and a feeling of the stress and struggle of the elements
introduced where there was perfect calm.</p>
<p>It is the aloofness of straight lines from all the fuss and
flurry of variety that gives them this calm, infinite expression.
And their value as a steadying influence among the more exuberant
forms of a composition is very great. The Venetians knew this and
made great use of straight lines among the richer forms they so
delighted in.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note how Giorgione in his "F&ecirc;te
Champ&ecirc;tre" of the Louvre (see illustration, page 151
[Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate33">Plate XXXIII</a>]), went out
of his way to get a straight line to steady his picture and
contrast with the curves. Not wanting it in the landscape, he has
boldly made the contour of the seated female conform to a rigid
straight line, accentuated still further by the flute in her hand.
If it were not for this and other straight lines in the picture,
and a certain squareness of drawing in the draperies, the richness
of the trees in the background, the full forms of the flesh and
drapery would be too much, and the effect become sickly, if not
positively sweet. Van Dyck, also, used to go out of his way to
introduce a hard straight line near the head in his portraits for
the same <a name='Page_154' id="Page_154"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>154</span>reason, often ending abruptly, without any
apparent reason, a dark background in a hard line, and showing a
distant landscape beyond in order to get a light mass to accentuate
the straight line.</p>

<p>The rich modelling and swinging lines of the "Bacchus and
Ariadne" of Titian in the National Gallery, here reproduced, page
154 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate34">Plate XXXIV</a>], would
be too gross, were it not for the steadying influence of the
horizontal lines in the sky and the vertical lines of the
tree-trunks.</p>
<p>While speaking of this picture, it might not be out of place to
mention an idea that occurred to me as to the reason for the
somewhat aggressive standing leg of the female figure with the
cymbals leading the procession of revellers. I will not attempt any
analysis of this composition, which is ably gone into in another
book of this series. But the standing leg of this figure, given
such prominence in the composition, has always rather puzzled me. I
knew Titian would not have given it that vigorous stand without a
good reason. It certainly does not help the run of the composition,
although it may be useful in steadying it, and it is not a
particularly beautiful thing in itself, as the position is one
better suited to a man's leg than to a woman's. But if you cover it
over with your finger and look at the composition without it, I
think the reason of its prominence becomes plainer. Titian
evidently had some trouble, as well he might have, with the forward
leg of the Bacchus. He wished to give the look of his stepping from
the car lightly treading the air, as gods may be permitted to do.
But the wheel of the car that comes behind the foot made it
difficult to evade the idea that he was stepping on it, which would
be the way an ordinary mortal <a name='Page_155' id=
"Page_155"></a><span class='pagenum'>155</span>would alight. I
think the duty of the aggressive standing leg of the leading
Bacchante, with its great look of weight, is to give a look of
lightness to this forward leg of Bacchus, by contrast&mdash;which
it certainly does. On examining the picture closely in a good
light, you will see that he has had the foot of Bacchus in several
positions before he got it right. Another foot can distinctly be
seen about a couple of inches or so above the present one. The
general vertical direction of this leg is also against its look of
lightness and motion, tending rather to give it a stationary,
static look. I could not at first see why he did not bring the foot
further to the right, which would have aided the lightness of the
figure and increased its movement. But you will observe that this
would have hurled the whole weight of the mass of figures on the
right, forward on to the single figure of Ariadne, and upset the
balance; as you can see by covering this leg with your finger and
imagining it swinging to the right. So that Titian, having to
retain the vertical position for Bacchus' forward leg, used the
aggressive standing leg of the cymbal lady to accentuate its spring
and lightness.</p>

<p>A feeling of straight-up-ness in a figure or of the horizontal
plane in anything will produce the same effect as a vertical or
horizontal line without any actual line being visible. Blake's
"Morning Stars Singing Together" is an instance of the vertical
chord, although there is no actual upright line in the figures. But
they all have a vigorous straight-up-ness that gives them the
feeling of peace and elevation coupled with a flame-like line
running through them that gives them their joyous energy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Right Angle</div>
<p>The combination of the vertical with the horizontal produces one
of the strongest and most arresting <a name='Page_156' id=
"Page_156"></a><span class='pagenum'>156</span>chords that you can
make, and it will be found to exist in most pictures and drawings
where there is the expression of dramatic power. The cross is the
typical example of this. It is a combination of lines that
instantly rivets the attention, and has probably a more powerful
effect upon the mind&mdash;quite apart from anything symbolised by
it&mdash;than any other simple combinations that could have been
devised. How powerful is the effect of a vertical figure, or even a
post, seen cutting the long horizontal line of the horizon on the
sea-shore. Or a telegraph post by the side of the road, seen
against the long horizontal line of a hill at sunset. The look of
power given by the vertical lines of a contracted brow is due to
the same cause. The vertical furrows of the brow continuing the
lines of the nose, make a continuous vertical which the horizontal
lines of the brow cross (see Fig. A in the illustration). The same
cause gives the profile a powerful look when the eyebrows make a
horizontal line contrasting with the vertical line of the forehead
(Fig. B). Everybody knows the look of power associated with a
square brow: it is not that the square forehead gives the look of a
larger brain capacity, for if the forehead protrudes in a curved
line, as at C, the look of power is lost, although there is
obviously more room for brains.</p>
<p>This power of the right angle is well exemplified in Watts'
"Love and Death," here reproduced, page 158 [Transcribers Note:
<a href="#plate35">Plate XXXV</a>]. <a name='Page_157' id=
"Page_157"></a><span class='pagenum'>157</span>In this noble
composition, in the writer's opinion one of the most sublime
expressions produced by nineteenth-century art, the irresistible
power and majesty of the slowly advancing figure of Death is
largely due to the right angle felt through the pose. Not getting
it in the contour, Watts has boldly introduced it by means of
shading the farther arm and insisting on the light upper edge of
the outstretched arm and hand, while losing somewhat the, outline
of the head beyond. Note also the look of power the insistence on
square forms in the drapery gives this figure. The expression is
still further emphasised by the hard square forms of the steps, and
particularly by the strong horizontal line of the first step so
insisted on, at right angles to the vertical stand of the figure;
and also the upright lines of the doorway above. In contrast with
the awful sublimity of this figure of Death, how touching is the
expression of the little figure of Love, trying vainly to stop the
inevitable advance. And this expression is due to the curved lines
on which the action of the figure is hung, and the soft undulating
forms of its modelling. Whereas the figure of Death is all square
lines and flat crisp planes, the whole hanging on a dramatic right
angle; this figure is all subtle fullness both of contour and
modelling melting one into the other, the whole hung upon a rich
full curve starting at the standing foot of the advancing figure.
And whereas the expression of Death is supported and emphasised by
the hard, square forms and texture of the stone steps, the
expression of Love is supported and emphasised by the rounded forms
and soft texture of the clustering roses. On this contrast of line
and form, so in sympathy with the <a name='Page_159' id=
"Page_159"></a><span class='pagenum'>159</span>profound sentiment
to which this picture owes its origin, the expressive power of this

</div>
<p>In the diagram accompanying the reproduction of this picture I
have tried to indicate in diagrammatical form some of the chief
lines of its anatomy.</p>
<p>In these diagrams of the anatomy of compositions the lines
selected are not always very obvious in the originals and are
justly much broken into by truths of natural appearance. But an
emotional significance depending on some arrangement of abstract
lines is to be found underlying the expression in every good
picture, carefully hidden as it is by all great artists. And
although some apology is perhaps necessary for the ugliness of
these diagrams, it is an ugliness that attends all anatomy
drawings. If the student will trace them and put his tracing over
the reproductions of the originals, they will help him to see on
what things in the arrangement the rhythmic force of the picture
depends.</p>
<p>Other lines, as important as those selected, may have been
overlooked, but the ones chosen will suffice to show the general
character of them all.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>There is one condition in a composition, that is laid down
before you begin, and that is the shape of your panel or canvas.
This is usually a rectangular form, and all the lines of your
design will have to be considered in relation to this shape.
Vertical and horizontal lines being parallel to the boundaries of
rectangular pictures, are always right and immediately set up a
relationship, as we have seen.</p>
<p>The arresting power of the right angle exists at each corner of
a rectangular picture, where the <a name='Page_160' id=
"Page_160"></a><span class='pagenum'>160</span>vertical sides meet
the horizontal base, and this presents a difficulty, because you do
not wish the spectator's attention drawn to the corners, and this
dramatic combination of lines always attracts the eye. A favourite
way of getting rid of this is to fill them with some dark mass, or
with lines swinging round and carrying the eye past them, so that
the attention is continually swung to the centre of the picture.
For lines have a power of directing the attention, the eye
instinctively running with them, and this power is of the greatest
service in directing the spectator to the principal interest.</p>
<p>It is this trouble with the corners that makes the problem of
filling a square so exacting. In an ordinary rectangular panel you
have a certain amount of free space in the middle, and the
difficulty of filling the corners comfortably does not present
itself until this space is arranged for. But in a square, the
moment you leave the centre you are in one or other of the corners,
and the filling of them governs the problem much more than in the
case of other shapes. It is a good exercise for students to give
themselves a square to fill, in order to understand this difficulty
and learn to overcome it.</p>
<p>Other lines that possess a direct relation to a rectangular
shape are the diagonals. Many compositions that do not hang on a
vertical or horizontal basis are built on this line, and are thus
related to the bounding shape.</p>
<div class='figure'><a name='plate36' id="plate36"></a> <a href=

<p>Plate XXXVI.</p>
<p>THE SURRENDER OF BREDA VELAZQUEZ (PRADO)</p>
<p><i>Photo Anderson</i></p>
</div>
<p>When vertical, horizontal, or diagonal lines are referred to, it
must not be assumed that one means in all cases naked lines. There
is no pure vertical line in a stone pine or cypress tree, nor pure
horizontal <a name='Page_161' id="Page_161"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>161</span> line in a stretch of country, but the whole
swing of their lines is vertical or horizontal. And in the same
way, when one speaks of a composition being hung upon a diagonal,
it is seldom that a naked diagonal line exists in the composition,
but the general swing is across the panel in harmony with one or
other diagonal. And when this is so, there is a unity set up
between the design and its boundaries. A good instance of vertical,
horizontal, and diagonal lines to unite a picture is Velazquez's
"The Surrender of Breda," here reproduced. Note the vertical chord
in the spears on the left, continued in the leg of the horse and
front leg of the figure receiving the key, and the horizontal line
made by the dark mass of distant city, to be continued by the gun
carried over the shoulder of the figure with the slouch hat behind
the principal group. Velazquez has gone out of his way to get this
line, as it could hardly have been the fashion to carry a gun in
this position, pointing straight at the head of the man behind.
Horizontal lines also occur in the sky and distant landscape, one
running right through the group of spears. The use of the diagonal
is another remarkable thing in the lines of this picture. If you
place a ruler on the slanting line of the flag behind the horse's
head to the right, you find it is exactly parallel to a diagonal
drawn from the top right-hand corner to the lower left-hand corner.
Another line practically parallel to this diagonal is the line of
the sword belonging to the figure offering the key, the feeling of
which is continued in the hand and key of this same figure. It may
be noted also that the back right leg of the horse in the front is
parallel to the other diagonal, the under side of it <a name='Page_162'
id="Page_162"></a><span class='pagenum'>162</span>being
actually on the diagonal and thus brought into relation with the
bounding lines of the picture. And all these lines, without the
artifice being too apparent, give that well-knit, dignified look so
in harmony with the nature of the subject.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Curved Lines</div>
<p>Curved lines have not the moral integrity of straight lines.
Theirs is not so much to minister to the expression of the sublime
as to woo us to the beauteous joys of the senses. They hold the
secrets of charm. But without the steadying power of straight lines
and flatnesses, curves get out of hand and lose their power. In
architecture the rococo style is an example of this excess. While
all expressions of exuberant life and energy, of charm and grace
depend on curved lines for their effect, yet in their most refined
and beautiful expression they err on the side of the square forms
rather than the circle. When the uncontrolled use of curves
approaching the circle and volute are indulged in, unrestrained by
the steadying influence of any straight lines, the effect is gross.
The finest curves are full of restraint, and excessive curvature is
a thing to be avoided in good drawing. We recognise this integrity
of straight lines when we say anybody is "an upright man" or is
"quite straight," wishing to convey the impression of moral
worth.</p>
<p>Rubens was a painter who gloried in the unrestrained expression
of the zeal to live and drink deeply of life, and glorious as much
of his work is, and wonderful as it all is, the excessive use of
curves and rounded forms in his later work robs it of much of its
power and offends us by its grossness. His best work is full of
squarer drawing and planes.</p>
<p><a name='Page_163' id="Page_163"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>163</span><b>Always be on the look out for straightnesses
in curved forms and for planes in your modelling.</b></p>
<p>Let us take our simplest form of composition again, a stretch of
sea and sky, and apply curved lines where we formerly had straight
lines. You will see how the lines at A, page 164 [Transcribers
Note: <a href="#diagram14">Diagram XIV</a>], although but slightly
curved, express some energy, where the straight lines of our former
diagram expressed repose, and then how in B and C the increasing
curvature of the lines increases the energy expressed, until in D,
where the lines sweep round in one vigorous swirl, a perfect
hurricane is expressed. This last, is roughly the rhythmic basis of
Turner's "Hannibal Crossing the Alps" in the Turner Gallery.</p>
<p>One of the simplest and most graceful forms the tying lines of a
composition may take is a continuous flow, one line evolving out of
another in graceful sequence, thus leading the eye on from one part
to another and carrying the attention to the principal
interests.</p>
<p>Two good instances of this arrangement are Botticelli's "Birth
of Venus" and the "Rape of Europa," by Paolo Veronese, reproduced
on pages 166 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#diagram15">Diagram
XV</a>, <a href="#plate27">Plate XXXVII</a>] and 168 [Transcribers
Note: <a href="#diagram16">Diagram XVI</a>, <a href=
"#plate38">Plate XXXVIII</a>]. The Venetian picture does not depend
so much on the clarity of its line basis as the Florentine. And it
is interesting to note how much nearer to the curves of the circle
the lines of Europa approach than do those of the Venus picture.
Were the same primitive treatment applied to the later work painted
in the oil medium as has been used by Botticelli in his tempera
picture, the robustness of the curves would have offended and been
too gross for the simple formula; whereas overlaid and hidden under
such a rich abundance of natural truth as it is in this gorgeous
picture, we are too <a name='Page_167' id=
"Page_167"></a><span class='pagenum'>167</span>much distracted and
entertained by such wealth to have time to dwell on the purity of
the line arrangement at its base. And the rich fullness of line
arrangement, although rather excessive, seen detached, is in
keeping with the sumptuous luxuriance the Venetian loved so well to
express. But for pure line beauty the greater restraint of the
curves in Botticelli's picture is infinitely more satisfying,
though here we have not anything like the same wealth and richness
of natural appearance to engage our attention, and the innocent
simplicity of the technique leaves much more exposed the structure
of lines, which in consequence play a greater part in the effect of
the picture.</p>

<p>In both cases note the way the lines lead up to the principal
subject, and the steadying power introduced by means of horizontal,
vertical, and other straight lines. Veronese has contented himself
with keeping a certain horizontal feeling in the sky, culminating
in the straight lines of the horizon and of the sea edge. And he
has also introduced two pyramids, giving straight lines in among
the trees, the most pronounced of which leads the eye straight on
to the principal head.</p>
<p>Botticelli has first the long line of the horizon echoed in the
ground at the right-hand lower corner. And then he has made a
determined stand against the flow of lines carrying you out of the
picture on the right, by putting straight, upright trees and
insisting upon their straightness.</p>

<p>Another rhythmic form the lines at the basis of a composition
may take is a flame-like flow of lines; curved lines meeting and
parting and meeting again, or even crossing in one continual
movement onwards. A striking instance of the use of this <a name='Page_169'
id="Page_169"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>169</span>quality is the work of the remarkable Spanish
painter usually called El Greco, two of whose works are here shown
(page 172 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate40">Plate XL</a>]).
Whatever may be said by the academically minded as to the
incorrectness of his drawing, there can be no two opinions as to
the remarkable rhythmic vitality of his work. The upward flow of
his lines and the flame-like flicker of his light masses thrills
one in much the same way as watching a flaring fire. There is
something exalting and stimulating in it, although, used to excess
as he sometimes uses it, it is apt to suffer from lack of repose.
Two examples of his pictures are reproduced here, and illustrate
his use of this form of movement in the lines and masses of his
compositions. Nowhere does he let the eye rest, but keeps the same
flickering movement going throughout all his masses and edges. The
extraordinary thing about this remarkable painter is that while
this restless, unrestrained form of composition makes his work akin
to the rococo work of a later period, there is a fiery earnestness
and sincerity in all he does, only to be matched among the
primitive painters of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and
very different from the false sentiment of the later school.</p>
<p>Blake was also fond of this flame line, but usually used it in
combination with more straight lines than the energetic Spaniard
allowed himself. Plates III and V in the Job series are good
examples of his use of this form. In both cases it will be seen
that he uses it in combination with the steadying influence of
straight lines, which help to keep the balance and repose necessary
in the treatment of even the most violent subjects in art.</p>
<p>A continual interruption in the flow of lines, and <a name='Page_171'
id="Page_171"></a><span class='pagenum'>171</span>a
harsh jarring of one against another in an angular, jagged fashion,
produces a feeling of terror and horror. A streak of fork lightning
is a natural example of this. The plate of Blake's No. XI, p. 148
[Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate32">Plate XXXII</a>], reproduced
here, is also a good example. I have had it put sideways on so that
you may see that the look of horror is not only in the subject but
belongs to the particular music of line in the picture. The effect
of the harsh contrasts in the lines is further added to by the
harsh contrasts of tone: everywhere hard lights are brought up
against hard darks. Harsh contrasts of tone produce much the same
look of terror as harsh contrasts of line. Battle pictures are
usually, when good, full of these clashes of line and tone, and
thrilling dramatic effects in which a touch of horror enters are
usually founded on the same principle. In the picture by Paolo
Uccello in the National Gallery, reproduced on page 170
[Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate39">Plate XXXIX</a>], a milder
edition of this effect is seen. The artist has been more interested
in the pageantry of war and a desire to show off his newly-acquired
knowledge of perspective, than anything very terrible. The
contrasts of line are here but confined to the smaller parts, and
there are no contrasts of light and shade, chiaroscuro not being
yet invented. However, it will be seen by the accompanying diagram
how consistently the harsh contrasts of line were carried out in
the planning of this picture. Notice the unconscious humour of the
foreshortened spears and figure carefully arranged on the ground to
vanish to the recently discovered vanishing point.</p>

<hr class='short' />
<p>Lines radiating in smooth curves from a common centre are
another form employed to give unity in pictorial design. The point
from which they radiate <a name='Page_172' id=
"Page_172"></a><span class='pagenum'>172</span>need not necessarily
be within the picture, and is often considerably outside it. But
the feeling that they would meet if produced gives them a unity
that brings them into harmonious relationship.</p>
<p>There is also another point about radiating lines, and that is
their power of setting up a relationship between lines otherwise
unrelated. Let us try and explain this. In Panel A, page 174
[Transcribers Note: <a href="#diagram18">Diagram XVIII</a>], are
drawn some lines at random, with the idea of their being as little
related to each other as possible. In B, by the introduction of
radiating lines in sympathy with them, they have been brought into
some sort of relationship. The line 1-2 has been selected as the
dominating line, and an assortment of radiating ones drawn about
it. Now, by drawing 7-8, we have set up a relationship between
lines 3-4, 5-6, and 1-2, for this line radiates with all of them.
Line 9-10 accentuates this relationship with 1-2. The others echo
the same thing. It is this echoing of lines through a composition
that unites the different parts and gives unity to the whole.</p>
<p>The crossing of lines at angles approaching the right angle is
always harsh and somewhat discordant, useful when you want to draw
attention dramatically to a particular spot, but to be avoided or
covered up at other times. There is an ugly clash of crossing lines
in our original scribble, and at C we have introduced a mass to
cover this up, and also the angles made by line 3-4 as it crosses
the radiating lines above 1-2. With a small mass at 11 to make the
balance right, you have a basis for a composition, Diagram C, not
at all unpleasing in arrangement, although based on a group of
discordant lines drawn at random, but brought into harmony by means
of sympathetic radiation.</p>

<p><a name='Page_173' id="Page_173"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>173</span>In Panel D the same group is taken, but this
time line 3-4 is used as the dominant one. Line 7-8 introduces 3-4
to 1-2, as it is related to both. Lines 9-10 and 11-12 introduce
3-4 to 5-6, as they are related to both, and the others follow on
the same principle. By introducing some masses covering up the
crossings, a rhythmic basis for a composition (Diagram E) entirely
different from C is obtained, based on the same random group.</p>
<p>In Panel F, 1-2 has been taken as the dominant line, and
sympathetic lines drawn on the same principle as before. By again
covering the crossings and introducing balancing masses we obtain
yet another arrangement from the same random scribble.</p>
<p>I would suggest this as a new game to students, one giving
another two or three lines drawn in a panel at random, the problem
being to make harmonious arrangements by the introduction of others
radiating in sympathy.</p>
<p>Often in a picture certain conditions are laid down to start
with; something as ugly as our original group of lines drawn at
random has to be treated pictorially, and it is by means such as
here suggested that its discordancy can be subdued and the whole
brought into harmony with the shape of your panel. The same
principles apply in colour, discordant notes can be brought into
harmony by the introduction of others related to both the original
colours, thus leading the eye from one to the other by easy stages
and destroying the shock. Somewhat in the way a musician will take
you from one key into another very remote by means of a few chords
leading from the one to the other; whereas, had he taken you
straight there, the shock would have <a name='Page_175' id=
"Page_175"></a><span class='pagenum'>175</span>been terrible. As it
is, these transitions from one key into another please and surprise
one, and are very effective.</p>

<p>In H, I have introduced a straight line into our <a name=
'Page_176' id="Page_176"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>176</span>initial scribble, and this somewhat increases
the difficulties of relating them. But by drawing 7-8 and 9-10
radiating from 1-2, we have introduced this straight line to 5-6.
For although 5-6 and 9-10 do not radiate from the same point, they
are obviously in sympathy. It is only a short part of the line at
the end marked 5 that is out of sympathy, and had 5-6 taken the
course of the dotted line, it would have radiated from the same
point as 9-10. We still have line 3-4 to account for. But by
drawing 11-12 we bring it into relationship with 5-6, and so by
stages through 9-10 and 7-8 to the original straight line 1-2. Line
13-14, by being related to 3-4, 11-12, and also 5-6, still further
harmonises the group, and the remainder echo 5-6 and increase the
dominant swing. At L masses have been introduced, covering crossing
lines, and we have a basis for a composition.</p>
<p>In Diagram I lines have been drawn as before, at random, but two
of them are straight and at right angles, the longer being across
the-centre of the panel. The first thing to do is to trick the eye
out of knowing that this line is in the centre by drawing others
parallel to it, leading the eye downwards to line 9-10, which is
now much more important than 1-2 and in better proportion with the
height of the panel. The vertical line 3-4 is rather stark and
lonely, and so we' introduce two more verticals at 11-12 and 13-14,
which modify this, and with another two lines in sympathy with 5-6
and leading the eye back to the horizontal top of the panel, some
sort of unity is set up, the introduction of some masses completing
the scheme at M.</p>
<p>There is a quality of sympathy set up by certain line
relationships about which it is important to say <a name='Page_177'
id="Page_177"></a><span class='pagenum'>177</span>something. Ladies
who have the instinct for choosing a hat or doing their hair to
suit their face instinctively know something of this; know that
certain things in their face are emphasised by certain forms in
their hats or hair, and the care that has to be taken to see that
the things thus drawn attention to are their best and not their
worst points.</p>
<p>The principle is more generally understood in relation to
colour; everybody knows how the blueness of blue eyes is emphasised
by a sympathetic blue dress or touch of blue on a hat, &amp;c. But
the same principle applies to lines. The qualities of line in
beautiful eyes and eyebrows are emphasised by the long sympathetic
curve of a picture hat, and the becoming effect of a necklace is
partly due to the same cause, the lines being in sympathy with the
eyes or the oval of the face, according to how low or high they
hang. The influence of long lines is thus to "pick out" from among
the lines of a face those with which they are in sympathy, and thus
to accentuate them.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, on page 178 [Transcribers Note: <a href=
"#plate52">Plate XLII</a>] is reproduced "The Portrait of the
Artist's Daughter," by Sir Edward Burne-Jones.</p>
<p>The two things that are brought out by the line arrangement in
this portrait are the beauty of the eyes and the shape of the face.
Instead of the picture hat you have the mirror, the widening
circles of which swing round in sympathy with the eyes and
concentrate the attention on them. That on the left (looking at the
picture) being nearest the centre, has the greatest attention
concentrated upon it, the lines of the mirror being more in
sympathy with this than the other eye, as it is nearer the <a name='Page_179'
id="Page_179"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>179</span>centre. If you care to take the trouble, cut a
hole in a piece of opaque paper the size of the head and placing it
over the illustration look at the face without the influence of
these outside lines; and note how much more equally divided the
attention is between the two eyes without the emphasis given to the
one by the mirror. This helps the unity of impression, which with
both eyes realised to so intense a focus might have suffered. This
mirror forms a sort of echo of the pupil of the eye with its
reflection of the window in the left-hand corner corresponding to
the high light, greatly helping the spell these eyes hold.</p>

</div>
<p>The other form accentuated by the line arrangement is the oval
of the face. There is the necklace the lines of which lead on to
those on the right in the reflection. It is no mere accident that
this chain is so in sympathy with the line of the face: it would
hardly have remained where it is for long, and must have been put
in this position by the artist with the intention (conscious or
instinctive) of accentuating the face line. The line of the
reflection on the left and the lines of the mirror are also
sympathetic. Others in the folds of the dress, and those forming
the mass of the hands and arms, echo still further this line of the
face and bring the whole canvas into intense sympathetic unity of
expression.</p>
<p>The influence that different ways of doing the hair may have on
a face is illustrated in the accompanying scribbles. The two
profiles are exactly alike&mdash;I took great trouble to make them
so. It is quite remarkable the difference the two ways of doing the
hair make to the look of the faces. The upward swing of the lines
in A sympathise with the line of the <a name='Page_180' id=
"Page_180"></a><span class='pagenum'>180</span>nose and the sharper
projections of the face generally (see dotted lines), while the
full downward curves of B sympathise with the fuller curves of
<a name='Page_181' id="Page_181"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>181</span>the face and particularly emphasise the
fullness under the chin so dreaded by beauty past its first youth
(see dotted lines). It is only a very sharply-cut face that can
stand this low knot at the back of the head, in which case it is
one of the simplest and most beautiful ways of doing the hair.
<a name='Page_182' id="Page_182"></a><span class=

the lines of the profile as the low knot blunts them.</p>

<p>The illustrations to this chapter have been drawn in
diagrammatical form in order to try and show that the musical
quality of lines and the emotions they are capable of calling up
are not dependent upon truth to natural forms but are inherent in
abstract arrangements themselves. That is to say, whenever you get
certain arrangements of lines, no matter what the objects in nature
may be that yield them, you will always get the particular
emotional stimulus belonging to such arrangements. For instance,
whenever you get long uninterrupted horizontal lines running
through a picture not opposed by any violent contrast, you will
always get an impression of intense quiet and repose; no matter
whether the natural objects yielding these lines are a wide stretch
of country with long horizontal clouds in the sky, a pool with a
gentle breeze making horizontal bars on its surface, or a pile of
wood in a timber yard. And whenever you get long vertical lines in
a composition, no matter whether it be a cathedral interior, a pine
forest, or a row of scaffold poles, you will always have the
particular feeling associated with rows of vertical lines in the
abstract. And further, whenever you get the swinging lines of the
volute, an impression of energy will be conveyed, no matter whether
it be a breaking wave, rolling clouds, whirling dust, or only a
mass of tangled hoop iron in a wheelwright's yard. As was said
above, these effects may be greatly increased, modified, or even
destroyed by associations connected with the things represented. If
in painting the timber yard the artist is thinking more about
making it look like a stack of real wood with its commercial
associations <a name='Page_183' id="Page_183"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>183</span>and less about using the artistic material its
appearance presents for the making of a picture, he may miss the
harmonic impression the long lines of the stacks of wood present.
If real wood is the first thing you are led to think of in looking
at his work, he will obviously have missed the expression of any
artistic feeling the subject was capable of producing. And the same
may be said of the scaffold poles or the hoop iron in the
wheelwright's yard.</p>
<p>This structure of abstract lines at the basis of a picture will
be more or less overlaid with the truths of nature, and all the
rich variety of natural forms, according to the requirements of the
subject. Thus, in large decorative work, where the painting has to
take its place as part of an architectural scheme, the severity of
this skeleton will be necessary to unite the work to the
architectural forms around it, of which it has to form a part; and
very little indulgence in the realisation of natural truth should
be permitted to obscure it. But in the painting of a small cabinet
picture that exists for close inspection, the supporting power of
this line basis is not nearly so essential, and a full indulgence
in all the rich variety of natural detail is permissible. And this
is how it happens that painters who have gloried in rich details
have always painted small pictures, and painters who have preferred
larger truths pictures of bigger dimensions. It sounds rather
paradoxical to say the smaller the picture the more detail it
should contain, and the larger the less, but it is nevertheless
true. For although a large picture has not of necessity got to be
part of an architectural scheme, it has to be looked at from a
distance at which small detail could not be seen, and where such
detail would greatly weaken its expressive power. <a name=
'Page_184' id="Page_184"></a><span class='pagenum'>184</span>And
further, the small picture easily comes within the field of vision,
and the whole impression can be readily grasped without the main
lines being, as it were, underlined. But in a big picture one of
the greatest difficulties is to get it to read simply, to strike
the eye as one impression. Its size making it difficult for it to
be got comfortably within the field of vision, every artifice has
to be used to give it "breadth of treatment," as it is called, and
nothing interferes with this like detail.</p>

<h2>XIII<br />
VARIETY OF MASS</h2>
<p>The masses that go to make up a picture have variety in their
<b>shape</b>, their <b>tone values</b>, their <b>edges</b>, in
<b>texture</b> <i>or</i> <b>quality</b>, and in <b>gradation</b>.
Quite a formidable list, but each of these particulars has some
rhythmic quality of its own about which it will be necessary to say
a word.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Variety of Shape.</div>
<p>As to variety of shape, many things that were said about lines
apply equally to the spaces enclosed by them. It is impossible to
write of the rhythmic possibilities that the infinite variety of
shapes possessed by natural objects contain, except to point out
how necessary the study of nature is for this. Variety of shape is
one of the most difficult things to invent, and one of the
commonest things in nature. However imaginative your conception,
and no matter how far you may carry your design, working from
imagination, there will come a time when studies from nature will
be necessary if your work is to have the variety that will give
life and interest. Try and draw from imagination a row of elm trees
of about the same height and distance apart, and get the variety of
nature into them; and you will see how difficult it is to invent.
On examining your work you will probably discover two or three pet
forms repeated, or there may be only one. Or try and draw some
cumulus clouds from imagination, several groups of them <a name='Page_186'
id="Page_186"></a><span class='pagenum'>186</span>across
a sky, and you will find how often again you have repeated
unconsciously the same forms. How tired one gets of the pet cloud
or tree of a painter who does not often consult nature in his
pictures. Nature is the great storehouse of variety; even a piece
of coal will suggest more interesting rock-forms than you can
invent. And it is fascinating to watch the infinite variety of
graceful forms assumed by the curling smoke from a cigarette, full
of suggestions for beautiful line arrangements. If this variety of
form in your work is allowed to become excessive it will overpower
the unity of your conception. It is in the larger unity of your
composition that the imaginative faculty will be wanted, and
variety in your forms should always be subordinated to this
idea.</p>
<p>Nature does not so readily suggest a scheme of unity, for the
simple reason that the first condition of your picture, the four
bounding lines, does not exist in nature. You may get infinite
suggestions for arrangements, and should always be on the look out
for them, but your imagination will have to relate them to the
rigorous conditions of your four bounding lines, and nature does
not help you much here. But when variety in the forms is wanted,
she is pre-eminent, and it is never advisable to waste inventive
power where it is so unnecessary.</p>
<p>But although nature does not readily suggest a design fitting
the conditions of a panel her tendency is always towards unity of
arrangement. If you take a bunch of flowers or leaves and haphazard
stuff them into a vase of water, you will probably get a very
chaotic arrangement. But if you leave it for some time and let
nature have <a name='Page_187' id="Page_187"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>187</span>a chance you will find that the leaves and
flowers have arranged themselves much more harmoniously. And if you
cut down one of a group of trees, what a harsh discordant gap is
usually left; but in time nature will, by throwing a bough here and
filling up a gap there, as far as possible rectify matters and
bring all into unity again. I am prepared to be told this has
nothing to do with beauty but is only the result of nature's
attempts to seek for light and air. But whatever be the physical
cause, the fact is the same, that nature's laws tend to pictorial
unity of arrangement.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Variety of Tone Values</div>
<p>It will be as well to try and explain what is meant by tone
values. All the masses or tones (for the terms are often used
interchangeably) that go to the making of a visual impression can
be considered in relation to an imagined scale from white, to
represent the lightest, to black, to represent the darkest tones.
This scale of values does not refer to light and shade only, but
light and shade, colour, and the whole visual impression are
considered as one mosaic of masses of different degrees of darkness
or lightness. A dark object in strong light may be lighter than a
white object in shadow, or the reverse: it will depend on the
amount of reflected light. Colour only matters in so far as it
affects the position of the mass in this imagined scale of black
and white. The correct observation of these tone values is a most
important matter, and one of no little difficulty.</p>
<p>The word tone is used in two senses, in the first place when
referring to the individual masses as to their relations in the
scale of "tone values"; and secondly when referring to the musical
relationship of these values to a oneness of tone idea <a name='Page_188'
id="Page_188"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>188</span>governing the whole impression. In very much
the same way you might refer to a single note in music as a tone,
and also to the tone of the whole orchestra. The word values always
refers to the relationship of the individual masses or tones in our
imagined scale from black to white. We say a picture is out of
value or out of tone when some of the values are darker or lighter
than our sense of harmony feels they should be, in the same way as
we should say an instrument in an orchestra was out of tone or tune
when it was higher or lower than our sense of harmony allowed. Tone
is so intimately associated with the colour of a picture that it is
a little difficult to treat of it apart, and it is often used in a
sense to include colour in speaking of the general tone. We say it
has a warm tone or a cold tone.</p>
<p>There is a particular rhythmic beauty about a well-ordered
arrangement of tone values that is a very important part of
pictorial design. This music of tone has been present in art in a
rudimentary way since the earliest time, but has recently received
a much greater amount of attention, and much new light on the
subject has been given by the impressionist movement and the study
of the art of China and Japan, which is nearly always very
beautiful in this respect.</p>
<p><b>This quality of tone music is most dominant when the masses
are large and simple</b>, when the contemplation of them is not
disturbed by much variety, and they have little variation of
texture and gradation. A slight mist will often improve the tone of
a landscape for this reason. It simplifies the tones, masses them
together, obliterating many smaller varieties. I have even heard of
the tone <a name='Page_189' id="Page_189"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>189</span>of a picture being improved by such a mist
scrambled or glazed over it.</p>
<div class='figure'><a name='plate43' id="plate43"></a> <a href=

title="" /></a>
<p>Plate XLIII.</p>
<p>MONTE SOLARO CAPRI</p>
<p>Study on brown paper in charcoal and white chalk.</p>
</div>
<p>The powder on a lady's face, when not over-done, is an
improvement for the same reason. It simplifies the tones by
destroying the distressing shining lights that were cutting up the
masses; and it also destroys a large amount of half tone,
broadening the lights almost up to the commencement of the
shadows.</p>
<p><b>Tone relationships are most sympathetic when the middle
values of your scale only are used, that is to say, when the lights
are low in tone and the darks high.</b></p>
<p><b>They are most dramatic and intense when the contrasts are
great and the jumps from dark to light sudden.</b></p>
<p>The sympathetic charm of half-light effects is due largely to
the tones being of this middle range only; whereas the striking
dramatic effect of a storm clearing, in which you may get a
landscape brilliantly lit by the sudden appearance of the sun, seen
against the dark clouds of the retreating storm, owes much of its
dramatic quality to contrast. The strong contrasts of tone values
coupled with the strong colour contrast between the warm sunlit
land and the cold angry blue of the storm, gives such a scene much
dramatic effect and power.</p>
<p>The subject of values will be further treated in dealing with
unity of tone.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Variety in Quality and Texture</div>
<p>Variety in quality and nature is almost too subtle to write
about with any prospect of being understood. The play of different
qualities and textures in the masses that go to form a picture must
be appreciated at first hand, and little can be written about it.
Oil paint is capable of almost unlimited variety in this <a name='Page_190'
id="Page_190"></a><span class='pagenum'>190</span>way.
But it is better to leave the study of such qualities until you
have mastered the medium in its more simple aspects.</p>
<p>The particular tone music of which we were speaking is not
helped by any great use of this variety. A oneness of quality
throughout the work is best suited to exhibit it. Masters of tone,
like Whistler, preserve this oneness of quality very carefully in
their work, relying chiefly on the grain of a rough canvas to give
the necessary variety and prevent a deadness in the quality of the
tones.</p>
<p>But when more force and brilliancy are wanted, some use of your
paint in a crumbling, broken manner is necessary, as it catches
more light, thus increasing the force of the impression. Claude
Monet and his followers in their search for brilliancy used this
quality throughout many of their paintings, with new and striking
results. But it is at the sacrifice of many beautiful qualities of
form, as this roughness of surface does not lend itself readily to
any finesse of modelling. In the case of Claude Monet's work,
however, this does not matter, as form with all its subtleties is
not a thing he made any attempt at exploiting. Nature is
sufficiently vast for beautiful work to be done in separate
departments of vision, although one cannot place such work on the
same plane with successful pictures of wider scope. And the
particular visual beauty of sparkling light and atmosphere, of
which he was one of the first to make a separate study, could
hardly exist in a work that aimed also at the significance of
beautiful form, the appeal of form, as was explained in an earlier
chapter, not being entirely due to a visual but to a mental
perception, into which the sense <a name='Page_191' id=
"Page_191"></a><span class='pagenum'>191</span>of touch enters by
association. The scintillation and glitter of light destroys this
touch idea, which is better preserved in quieter lightings.</p>
<p>There is another point in connection with the use of thick
paint, that I don't think is sufficiently well known, and that is,
its greater readiness to be discoloured by the oil in its
composition coming to the surface. Fifteen years ago I did what it
would be advisable for every student to do as soon as possible,
namely, make a chart of the colours he is likely to use. Get a good
white canvas, and set upon it in columns the different colours,
very much as you would do on your palette, writing the names in ink
beside them. Then take a palette-knife, an ivory one by preference,
and drag it from the individual masses of paint so as to get a
gradation of different thicknesses, from the thinnest possible
layer where your knife ends to the thick mass where it was squeezed
out of the tube. It is also advisable to have previously ruled some
pencil lines with a hard point down the canvas in such a manner
that the strips of paint will cross the lines. This chart will be
of the greatest value to you in noting the effect of time on paint.
To make it more complete, the colours of several makers should be
put down, and at any rate the whites of several different makes
should be on it. As white enters so largely into your painting it
is highly necessary to use one that does not change.</p>
<p>The two things that I have noticed are that the thin ends of the
strips of white have invariably kept whiter than the thick end, and
that all the paints have become a little more transparent with
time. The pencil lines here come in useful, as they can be seen
through the thinner portion, and show to what <a name='Page_192'
id="Page_192"></a><span class='pagenum'>192</span>extent this
transparency has occurred. But the point I wish to emphasise is
that at the thick end the larger body of oil in the paint, which
always comes to the surface as it dries, has darkened and yellowed
the surface greatly; while the small amount of oil at the thin end
has not darkened it to any extent.</p>
<p>Claude Monet evidently knew this, and got over the difficulty by
painting on an absorbent canvas, which sucks the surplus oil out
from below and thus prevents its coming to the surface and
discolouring the work in time. When this thick manner of painting
is adopted, an absorbent canvas should always be used. It also has
the advantage of giving a dull dry surface of more brilliancy than
a shiny one.</p>
<p>Although not so much as with painting, varieties of texture
enter into drawings done with any of the mediums that lend
themselves to mass drawing; charcoal, cont&eacute; crayon,
lithographic chalk, and even red chalk and lead pencil are capable
of giving a variety of textures, governed largely by the surface of
the paper used. But this is more the province of painting than of
drawing proper, and charcoal, which is more painting than drawing,
is the only medium in which it can be used with much effect.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Variety of Edges.</div>
<p>There is a very beautiful rhythmic quality in the play from
softness to sharpness on the edges of masses. A monotonous
sharpness of edge is hard, stern, and unsympathetic. This is a
useful quality at times, particularly in decorative work, where the
more intimate sympathetic qualities are not so much wanted, and
where the harder forms go better with the architectural
surroundings of which your painted decoration should form a part.
On the other hand, a monotonous softness of edge is very weak and
feeble-looking, and <a name='Page_193' id=
"Page_193"></a><span class='pagenum'>193</span>too entirely lacking
in power to be desirable. If you find any successful work done with
this quality of edge unrelieved by any sharpnesses, it will depend
on colour, and not form, for any qualities it may possess.</p>
<p>Some amount of softness makes for charm, and is extremely
popular: "<b>I do</b> like that because it's so nice and soft" is a
regular show-day remark in the studio, and is always meant as a
great compliment, but is seldom taken as such by the suffering
painter. But a balance of these two qualities playing about your
contours produces the most delightful results, and the artist is
always on the look out for such variations. He seldom lets a
sharpness of edge run far without losing it occasionally. It may be
necessary for the hang of the composition that some leading edges
should be much insisted on. But even here a monotonous sharpness is
too dead a thing, and although a firmness of run will be allowed to
be felt, subtle variations will be introduced to prevent deadness.
The Venetians from Giorgione's time were great masters of this
music of edges. The structure of lines surrounding the masses on
which their compositions are built were fused in the most
mysterious and delightful way. But although melting into the
surrounding mass, they are always firm and never soft and feeble.
Study the edge in such a good example of the Venetian manner as the
"Bacchus and Ariadne" at the National Gallery, and note where they
are hard and where lost.</p>
<p>There is one rather remarkable fact to be observed in this
picture and many Venetian works, and this is that the <b>most
accented edges are reserved for unessential parts</b>, like the
piece of white drapery <a name='Page_194' id=
"Page_194"></a><span class='pagenum'>194</span>on the lower arm of
the girl with the cymbals, and the little white flower on the boy's
head in front. The edges on the flesh are everywhere fused and
soft, the draperies being much sharper. You may notice the same
thing in many pictures of the later Venetian schools. The greatest
accents on the edges are rarely in the head, except it may be
occasionally in the eyes. But they love to get some
strongly-accented feature, such as a crisply-painted shirt coming
against the soft modelling of the neck, to balance the fused edges
in the flesh. In the head of Philip IV in our National Gallery the
only place where Velazquez has allowed himself anything like a
sharp edge is in the high lights on the chain hanging round the
neck. The softer edges of the principal features in these
compositions lend a largeness and mystery to these parts, and to
restore the balance, sharpnesses are introduced in non-essential
accessories.</p>
<p>In the figure with the white tunic from Velazquez's "Surrender
of Breda," here reproduced, note the wonderful variety on the edges
of the white masses of the coat and the horse's nose, and also that
the sharpest accents are reserved for such non-essentials as the
bows on the tunic and the loose hair on the horse's forehead.
Velazquez's edges are wonderful, and cannot be too carefully
studied. He worked largely in flat tones or planes; but this
richness and variety of his edges keeps his work from looking flat
and dull, like that of some of his followers. I am sorry to say
this variety does not come out so well in the reproduction on page
194 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate44">Plate XLIV</a>] as I
could have wished, the half-tone process having a tendency to
sharpen edges rather monotonously.</p>
<p>This quality is everywhere to be found in <a name='Page_195' id=
"Page_195"></a><span class='pagenum'>195</span>nature. If you
regard any scene pictorially, looking at it as a whole and not
letting your eye focus on individual objects wandering from one to
another while being but dimly conscious of the whole, but regarding
it as a beautiful ensemble; you will find that the boundaries of
the masses are not hard continuous edges but play continually along
their course, here melting imperceptibly into the surrounding mass,
and there accentuated more sharply. Even a long continuous line,
like the horizon at sea, has some amount of this play, which you
should always be on the look out for. But when the parts only of
nature are regarded and each is separately focussed, hard edges
will be found to exist almost everywhere, unless there is a
positive mist enveloping the objects. And this is the usual way of
looking at things. But a picture that is a catalogue of many little
parts separately focussed will not hang together as one visual
impression.</p>

</div>
<p>In naturalistic work the necessity for painting to one focal
impression is as great as the necessity of painting in true
perspective. What perspective has done for drawing, the
impressionist system of painting to one all-embracing focus has
done for tone. Before perspective was introduced, each individual
object in a picture was drawn with a separate centre of vision
fixed on each object in turn. What perspective did was to insist
that all objects in a picture should be drawn in relation to one
fixed centre of vision. And whereas formerly each object was
painted to a hard focus, whether it was in the foreground or the
distance, impressionism teaches that you cannot have the focus in a
picture at the same time on the foreground and the distance.</p>
<p><a name='Page_196' id="Page_196"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>196</span>Of course there are many manners of painting
with more primitive conventions in which the consideration of focus
does not enter. But in all painting that aims at reproducing the
impressions directly produced in us by natural appearances, this
question of focus and its influence on the quality of your edges is
of great importance.</p>
<p>Something should be said about the serrated edges of masses,
like those of trees seen against the sky. These are very difficult
to treat, and almost every landscape painter has a different
formula. The hard, fussy, cut-out, photographic appearance of trees
misses all their beauty and sublimity.</p>
<p>There are three principal types of treatment that may serve as
examples. In the first place there are the trees of the early
Italian painters, three examples of which are illustrated on page
197 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#diagram23">Diagram XXIII</a>]. A
thin tree is always selected, and a rhythmic pattern of leaves
against the sky painted. This treatment of a dark pattern on a
light ground is very useful as a contrast to the softer tones of
flesh. But the treatment is more often applied nowadays to a spray
of foliage in the foreground, the pattern of which gives a very
rich effect. The poplar trees in Millais' "Vale of Rest" are
painted in much the same manner as that employed by the Italians,
and are exceptional among modern tree paintings, the trees being
treated as a pattern of leaves against the sky. Millais has also
got a raised quality of paint in his darks very similar to that of
Bellini and many early painters.</p>
<p>Giorgione added another tree to landscape art: the rich, full,
solidly-massed forms that occur in his "Concert Champ&ecirc;tre" of
the Louvre, reproduced on page 151 [Transcribers Note: <a href=
"#plate33">Plate XXXIII</a>]. In this picture you may see both
types <a name='Page_197' id="Page_197"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>197</span>of treatment. There are the patterns of leaves
variety on the left and the solidly-massed treatment on the
right.</p>

</div>
<p>Corot in his later work developed a treatment that has been
largely followed since. Looking at trees with a very wide focus, he
ignored individual leaves, and resolved them into masses of tone,
<a name='Page_198' id="Page_198"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>198</span>here lost and here found more sharply against
the sky. The subordinate masses of foliage within these main
boundaries are treated in the same way, resolved into masses of
infinitely varying edges. This play, this lost-and-foundness at his
edges is one of the great distinguishing charms of Corot's trees.
When they have been painted from this mass point of view, a
suggestion of a few leaves here and a bough there may be indicated,
coming sharply against the sky, but you will find this basis of
tone music, this crescendo and diminuendo throughout all his later
work (see illustration, page 215 [Transcribers Note: <a href=
"#diagram26">Diagram XXVI</a>]).</p>
<p>These are three of the more extreme types of trees to be met
with in art, but the variations on these types are very numerous.
Whatever treatment you adopt, the tree must be considered as a
whole, and some rhythmic form related to this large impression
selected. And this applies to all forms with serrated edges: some
large order must be found to which the fussiness of the edges must
conform.</p>
<p>The subject of edges generally is a very important one, and one
much more worried over by a master than by the average student. It
is interesting to note how all the great painters have begun with a
hard manner, with edges of little variety, from which they have
gradually developed a looser manner, learning to master the
difficulties of design that hard contours insist on your facing,
and only when this is thoroughly mastered letting themselves
develop freely this play on the edges, this looser handling.</p>
<p>For under the freest painting, if it be good, there will be
found a bed-rock structure of well-constructed <a name='Page_199'
id="Page_199"></a><span class='pagenum'>199</span>masses and lines.
They may never be insisted on, but their steadying influence will
always be felt. So err in your student work on the side of hardness
rather than looseness, if you would discipline yourself to design
your work well. Occasionally only let yourself go at a looser
handling.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Variety of Gradiation.</div>
<p>Variety of gradation will naturally be governed largely by the
form and light and shade of the objects in your composition. But
while studying the gradations of tone that express form and give
the modelling, you should never neglect to keep the mind fixed upon
the relation the part you are painting bears to the whole picture.
And nothing should be done that is out of harmony with this large
conception. It is one of the most difficult things to decide the
amount of variety and emphasis allowable for the smaller parts of a
picture, so as to bring all in harmony with that oneness of
impression that should dominate the whole; how much of your scale
of values it is permissible to use for the modelling of each
individual part. In the best work the greatest economy is exercised
in this respect, so that as much power may be kept in reserve as
possible. You have only the one scale from black to white to work
with, only one octave within the limits of which to compose your
tone symphonies. There are no higher and lower octaves as in music
to extend your effect. So be very sparing with your tone values
when modelling the different parts.</p>

<h2>XIV<br />
UNITY OF MASS</h2>
<p>What has been said about unity of line applies obviously to the
outlines bounding the masses, so that we need not say anything
further on that subject. The particular quality of which something
should be said, is the unity that is given to a picture by means of
a well-arranged and rhythmically considered scheme of tone
values.</p>
<p>The modifications in the relative tone values of objects seen
under different aspects of light and atmosphere are infinite and
ever varying; and this is quite a special study in itself. Nature
is the great teacher here, her tone arrangements always possessing
unity. How kind to the eye is her attempt to cover the ugliness of
our great towns in an envelope of atmosphere, giving the most
wonderful tone symphonies; thus using man's desecration of her air
by smoke to cover up his other desecration of her country-side, a
manufacturing town. This study of values is a distinguishing
feature of modern art.</p>
<p>But schemes taken from nature are not the only harmonious ones.
The older masters were content with one or two well-tried
arrangements of tone in their pictures, which were often not at all
true to natural appearances but nevertheless harmonious. The chief
instance of this is the low-toned sky. The painting of flesh higher
in tone than the sky was <a name='Page_201' id=
"Page_201"></a><span class='pagenum'>201</span>almost universal at
many periods of art, and in portraits is still often seen. Yet it
is only in strong sunlight that this is ever so in nature, as you
can easily see by holding your hand up against a sky background.
The possible exception to this rule is a dark storm-cloud, in which
case your hand would have to be strongly lit by some bright light
in another part of the sky to appear light against it.</p>
<p>This high tone of the sky is a considerable difficulty when one
wishes the interest centred on the figures. The eye instinctively
goes to the light masses in a picture, and if these masses are sky,
the figures lose some importance. The fashion of lowering its tone
has much to be said for it on the score of the added interest it
gives to the figures. But it is apt to bring a heavy stuffy look
into the atmosphere, and is only really admissible in frankly
conventional treatment, in which one has not been led to expect
implicit truth to natural effect. If truth to natural appearances
is carried far in the figures, the same truth will be expected in
the background; but if only certain truths are selected in the
figures, and the treatment does not approach the naturalistic, much
more liberty can be taken with the background without loss of
verisimilitude.</p>
<p>But there is a unity about nature's tone arrangements that it is
very difficult to improve upon; and it is usually advisable, if you
can, to base the scheme of tone in your picture on a good study of
values from nature.</p>
<p>Such effects as twilight, moonlight, or even sunlight were
seldom attempted by the older painters, at any rate in their figure
subjects. All the lovely tone arrangements that nature presents in
these more unusual aspects are a new study, and offer <a name='Page_202'
id="Page_202"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>202</span>unlimited new material to the artist. Many
artists are content to use this simply for itself, the beauty of a
rare tone effect being sufficient with the simplest accessories to
make a picture. But in figure composition, what new and wonderful
things can be imagined in which some rare aspect of nature's
tone-music is combined with a fine figure design.</p>
<p>These values are not easily perceived with accuracy, although
their influence may be felt by many. A true eye for the accurate
perception of subtle tone arrangements is a thing you should study
very diligently to acquire. How then is this to be done? It is very
difficult, if not impossible, to teach anybody to see. Little more
can be said than has already been written about this subject in the
chapter on variety in mass. Every mass has to be considered in
relation to an imagined tone scale, taking black for your darkest
and white for your highest light as we have seen. A black glass, by
reducing the light, enables you to observe these relationships more
accurately; the dazzling quality of strong light making it
difficult to judge them. But this should only be used to correct
one's eye, and the comparison should be made between nature seen in
the glass and your work seen also in the glass. To look in a black
glass and then compare what you saw with your work looked at direct
is not a fair comparison, and will result in low-toned work with
little brilliancy.</p>
<p>Now, to represent this scale of tones in painting we have white
paint as our highest and black paint as our lowest notes. It is
never advisable to play either of these extremes, although you may
go very near to them. That is to say, there should never be pure
white or pure black masses in a <a name='Page_203' id=
"Page_203"></a><span class='pagenum'>203</span>picture. There is a
kind of screaminess set up when one goes the whole gamut of tone,
that gives a look of unrestraint and weakness; somewhat like the
feeling experienced when a vocalist sings his or her very highest
or very lowest note. In a good singer one always feels he could
have gone still higher or still lower, as the case may be, and this
gives an added power to the impression of his singing. And in art,
likewise, it is always advisable to keep something of this reserve
power. Also, the highest lights in nature are never without colour,
and this will lower the tone; neither are the deepest darks
colourless, and this will raise their tone. But perhaps this is
dogmatising, and it may be that beautiful work is to be done with
all the extremes you can "clap on," though I think it very
unlikely.</p>
<p>In all the quieter aspects of lighting this range from black to
white paint is sufficient. But where strong, brilliantly lit
effects are wanted, something has to be sacrificed, if this look of
brilliancy is to be made telling.</p>
<p>In order to increase the relationship between some of the tones
others must be sacrificed. There are two ways of doing this. The
first, which was the method earliest adopted, is to begin from the
light end of the scale, and, taking something very near pure white
as your highest light, to get the relationships between this and
the next most brilliant tone, and to proceed thus, tone by tone,
from the lightest to the darkest. But working in this way you will
find that you arrive at the greatest dark you can make in paint
before you have completed the scale of relationships as in nature,
if the subject happens to be brilliantly lit. <a name='Page_204'
id="Page_204"></a><span class='pagenum'>204</span>Another method is
to put down the highest light and the darkest dark, and then work
your scale of tone relatively between them. But it will be found
that working in this way, unless the subject in nature is very
quietly lit, you will not get anything like the forceful impression
of tone that nature gives.</p>
<p>The third way, and this is the more modern, is to begin from the
dark end of the scale, getting the true relationship felt between
the greatest dark and the next darkest tone to it, and so on,
proceeding towards the light. By this method you will arrive at
your highest light in paint before the highest light in nature has
been reached. All variety of tone at the light end of the scale
will have to be modified in this case, instead of at the dark end
as in the other case. In the painting of sunlight the latter method
is much the more effective, a look of great brilliancy and light
being produced, whereas in the earlier method, the scale being
commenced from the light end, so much of the picture was dark that
the impression of light and air was lost and a dark gloomy land
took its place, a gloom accentuated rather than dispelled by the
streaks of lurid light where the sun struck.</p>
<p>Rembrandt is an example of beginning the tone relationships from
the light side of the scale, and a large part of his canvas is in
consequence always dark.</p>
<p>Bastien Lepage is an example of the second method, that of
fixing upon two extremes and working-relatively between them. And
it will be noticed that he confined himself chiefly to quiet grey
day effects of lighting, the rendering of which was well within the
range of his palette. <a name='Page_205' id=
"Page_205"></a><span class='pagenum'>205</span>The method of
beginning from the dark side, getting the true relations of tones
on this side of the scale, and letting the lights take care of
themselves, was perhaps first used by Turner. But it is largely
used now whenever a strong impression of light is desired. The
light masses instead of the dark masses dominate the pictures,
which have great brilliancy.</p>
<p>These tone values are only to be perceived in their true
relationship by the eye contemplating a wide field of vision. With
the ordinary habit of looking only at individual parts of nature,
the general impression being but dimly felt, they are not observed.
The artist has to acquire the habit of generalising his visual
attention over a wide field if he would perceive the true relation
of the parts to this scale of values. Half closing the eyes, which
is the usual method of doing this, destroys the perception of a
great deal of colour. Another method of throwing the eyes out of
focus and enabling one to judge of large relationships, is to
dilate them widely. This rather increases than diminishes the
colour, but is not so safe a method of judging subtle tone
relationships.</p>
<p>It is easier in approaching this study out of doors to begin
with quiet effects of light. Some of those soft grey days in this
country are very beautiful in tone, and change so little that
careful studies can be made. And with indoor work, place your
subject rather away from the direct light and avoid much light and
shade; let the light come from behind you.</p>
<p>If very strong light effects, such as sunlight, or a dark
interior lit by one brilliant window, are attempted, the values
will be found to be much simpler and more harsh, often resolving
themselves into two <a name='Page_206' id=
"Page_206"></a><span class='pagenum'>206</span>masses, a brilliant
light contrasted with a dark shadow. This tone arrangement of
strong light in contrast with dark shadow was a favourite formula
with many schools of the past, since Leonardo da Vinci first used
it. Great breadth and splendour is given by it to design, and it is
one of the most impressive of tone arrangements. Leonardo da
Vinci's "Our Lady of the Rocks," in the National Gallery, is an
early example of this treatment. And Correggio's "Venus, Mercury,
and Cupid," here reproduced, is another particularly fine example.
Reynolds and many of the eighteenth-century men used this scheme in
their work almost entirely. This strong light and shade, by
eliminating to a large extent the half tones, helps to preserve in
highly complete work a simplicity and directness of statement that
is very powerful. For certain impressions it probably will never be
bettered, but it is a very well-worn convention. Manet among the
moderns has given new life to this formula, although he did not
derive his inspiration directly from Correggio but through the
Spanish school. By working in a strong, rather glaring, direct
light, he eliminated still further the half tones, and got rid to a
great extent of light and shade. Coming at a time when the
realistic and plain air movements were destroying simple
directness, his work was of great value, bringing back, as it did
with its insistence on large, simple masses, a sense of frank
design. His influence has been very great in recent years, as
artists have felt that it offered a new formula for design and
colour. Light and shade and half tone are the great enemies of
colour, sullying, as they do, its purity; and to some extent to
design also, destroying, as they do, the flatness of the picture.
But with the strong direct <a name='Page_207' id=
"Page_207"></a><span class='pagenum'>207</span>light, the masses
are cut out as simply as possible, and their colour is little
sullied by light and shade. The picture of Manet's reproduced is a
typical example of his manner. The aggressive shape of the pattern
made by the light mass against the dark background is typical of
his revolutionary attitude towards all accepted canons of beauty.
But even here it is interesting to note that many principles of
composition are conformed to. The design is united to its
boundaries by the horizontal line of the couch and the vertical
line of the screen at the back, while the whole swing hangs on the
diagonal from top left-hand corner to right; lower corner, to which
the strongly marked edge of the bed-clothes and pillow at the
bottom of the picture is parallel.</p>

<p>Large flat tones give a power and simplicity to a design, and a
largeness and breadth of expression that are very valuable, besides
showing up every little variety in the values used for your
modelling; and thus enabling you to model with the least
expenditure of tones. Whatever richness of variation you may
ultimately desire to add to your values, see to it that in planning
your picture you get a good basic structure of simply designed, and
as far as possible flat, tones.</p>
<p>In speaking of variety in mass we saw how the <b>nearer these
tones are in the scale of values, the more reserved and quiet the
impression created</b>, and the <b>further apart or greater the
contrast, the more dramatic and intense the effect</b>. And the
sentiment of tone in a picture, like the sentiment of line and
colour, should be in harmony with the nature of your subject.</p>
<p>Generally speaking <b>more variety of tone and shape <a name='Page_208'
id="Page_208"></a><span class='pagenum'>208</span>in the
masses of your composition is permissible when a smaller range of
values is used than when your subject demands strong contrasts</b>.
When strong contrasts of tone or what are called black and white
effects are desired, the masses must be very simply designed. Were
this not so, and were the composition patterned all over with
smaller masses in strong contrast, the breadth and unity of the
effect would be lost. While when the difference of relative values
between one tone and another is slight, the oneness of effect is
not so much interfered with by there being a large number of them.
Effects of strong contrasts are therefore far the most difficult to
manage, as it is not easy to reduce a composition of any complexity
to a simple expressive pattern of large masses.</p>
<p>This principle applies also in the matter of colour. Greater
contrasts and variety of colour may be indulged in where the middle
range only of tones is used, and where there is little tone
contrast, than where there is great contrast. In other words, you
cannot with much hope of success have strong contrasts of colour
and strong contrasts of tone in the same picture: it is too
violent.</p>
<p>If you have strong contrasts of colour, the contrasts of tone
between them must be small. The Japanese and Chinese often make the
most successful use of violent contrasts of colour by being careful
that they shall be of the same tone value.</p>
<p>And again, where you have strong contrasts of tone, such as
Rembrandt was fond of, you cannot successfully have strong
contrasts of colour as well. Reynolds, who was fond both of colour
and strong tone contrast, had to compromise, as he tells us in
<a name='Page_209' id="Page_209"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>209</span>his lectures, by making the shadows all the
same brown colour, to keep a harmony in his work.</p>

<p>There is some analogy between straight lines and flat tones, and
curved lines and gradated tones. And a great deal that was said
about the rhythmic significance of these lines will apply equally
well here. What was said about long vertical and horizontal lines
conveying a look of repose and touching the serious emotional
notes, can be said of large flat tones. The feeling of infinity
suggested by a wide blue sky without a cloud, seen above a wide
bare plain, is an obvious instance of this. And for the same
harmonic cause, a calm evening has so peaceful and infinite an
expression. The waning light darkens the land and increases the
contrast between it and the sky, with the result that all the
landscape towards the west is reduced to practically one dark tone,
cutting sharply against the wide light of the sky.</p>
<p>And the graceful charm of curved lines swinging in harmonious
rhythm through a composition has its analogy in gradated tones.
Watteau and Gainsborough, those masters of charm, knew this, and in
their most alluring compositions the tone-music is founded on a
principle of tone-gradations, swinging and interlacing with each
other in harmonious rhythm throughout the composition. Large, flat
tones, with their more thoughtful associations are out of place
here, and are seldom if ever used. In their work we see a world
where the saddening influences of profound thought and its
expression are far away. No deeper notes are allowed to mar the
gaiety of this holiday world. Watteau created a dream country of
his own, in which a tired humanity has delighted ever since, in
which all serious thoughts are far away and the mind takes <a name='Page_211'
id="Page_211"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>211</span>refreshment in the contemplation of delightful
things. And a great deal of this charm is due to the pretty play
from a crescendo to a diminuendo in the tone values on which his
compositions are based&mdash;so far removed from the simple
structure of flat masses to which more primitive and austere art
owes its power.</p>

<p>But Watteau's great accomplishment was in doing this without
degenerating into feeble prettiness, and this he did by an
insistence on character in his figures, particularly his men. His
draperies also are always beautifully drawn and full of variety,
never feeble and characterless. The landscape backgrounds are much
more lacking in this respect, nothing ever happened there, no
storms have ever bent his graceful tree-trunks, and the incessant
gradations might easily become wearisome. But possibly the charm in
which we delight would be lost, did the landscape possess more
character. At any rate there is enough in the figures to prevent
any sickly prettiness, although I think if you removed the figures
the landscape would not be tolerable.</p>
<p>But the followers of Watteau seized upon the prettiness and
gradually got out of touch with the character, and if you compare
Boucher's heads, particularly his men's heads, with Watteau's you
may see how much has been lost.</p>
<p>The following are three examples of this gradated tone
composition (see pages 210 [Transcribers Note: <a href=
"#diagram24">Diagram XXIV</a>], 213 [Transcribers Note: <a href=
"#diagram25">Diagram XXV</a>], 215 [Transcribers Note: <a href=
"#diagram26">Diagram XXVI</a>]):</p>
<p>Watteau: "Embarquement pour L'&Icirc;le de Cyth&egrave;re."</p>
<p>This is a typical Watteau composition, founded on a rhythmic
play of gradated tones and gradated edges. Flat tones and hard
edges are avoided. Beginning at the centre of the top with a
strongly accented note of contrast, the dark tone of the mass of
trees gradates into the ground and on past <a name='Page_212' id=
"Page_212"></a><span class='pagenum'>212</span>the lower right-hand
corner across the front of the picture, until, when nearing the
lower left-hand corner, it reverses the process and from dark to
light begins gradating light to dark, ending somewhat sharply
against the sky in the rock form to the left. The rich play of tone
that is introduced in the trees and ground, &amp;c., blinds one at
first to the perception of this larger tone motive, but without it
the rich variety would not hold together. Roughly speaking the
whole of this dark frame of tones from the accented point of the
trees at the top to the mass of the rock on the left, may be said
to gradate away into the distance; cut into by the wedge-shaped
middle tone of the hills leading to the horizon.</p>
<p>Breaking across this is a graceful line of figures, beginning on
the left where the mass of rock is broken by the little flight of
cupids, and continuing across the picture until it is brought up
sharply by the light figure under the trees on the right. Note the
pretty clatter of spots this line of figures brings across the
picture, introducing light spots into the darker masses, ending up
with the strongly accented light spot of the figure on the right;
and dark spots into the lighter masses, ending up with the figures
of the cupids dark against the sky.</p>
<p>Steadying influences in all this flux of tone are introduced by
the vertical accent of the tree-stem and statue in the dark mass on
the right, by the horizontal line of the distance on the left, the
outline of the ground in the front, and the straight staffs held by
some of the figures.</p>
<p>In the charcoal scribble illustrating this composition I have
tried carefully to avoid any drawing in the figures or trees to
show how the tone-music depends not so much on truth to natural
appearances <a name='Page_214' id="Page_214"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>214</span>as on the abstract arrangement of tone values
and their rhythmic play.</p>

<p>SHOWING THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE MASS OR TONE RHYTHM IS
ARRANGED IN TURNER'S PICTURE IN THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF BRITISH
ART, "ULYSSES DERIDING POLYPHEMUS"</p>
</div>
<p>Of course nature contains every conceivable variety of
tone-music, but it is not to be found by unintelligent copying
except in rare accidents. Emerson says, "Although you search the
whole world for the beautiful you'll not find it unless you take it
with you," and this is true to a greater extent of rhythmic tone
arrangements.</p>
<p>Turner: "Ulysses deriding Polyphemus."</p>
<p>Turner was very fond of these gradated tone compositions, and
carried them to a lyrical height to which they had never before
attained. His "Ulysses deriding Polyphemus," in the National
Gallery of British Art, is a splendid example of his use of this
principle. A great unity of expression is given by bringing the
greatest dark and light together in sharp contrast, as is done in
this picture by the dark rocks and ships' prows coming against the
rising sun. From this point the dark and light masses gradate in
different directions until they merge above the ships' sails. These
sails cut sharply into the dark mass as the rocks and ship on the
extreme right cut sharply into the light mass. Note also the edges
where they are accented and come sharply against the neighbouring
mass, and where they are lost, and the pleasing quality this play
of edges gives.</p>
<p>Stability is given by the line of the horizon and waves in
front, and the masts of the ships, the oars, and, in the original
picture, a feeling of radiating lines from the rising sun. Without
these steadying influences these compositions of gradated masses
would be sickly and weak.</p>
<p>Corot: 2470 Collection Chauchard, Louvre.</p>
<p>This is a typical example of Corot's tone scheme, <a name=
'Page_216' id="Page_216"></a><span class='pagenum'>216</span>and
little need be added to the description already given. Infinite
play is got with the simplest means. A dark silhouetted mass is
seen against a light sky, the perfect balance of the shapes and the
infinite play of lost-and-foundness in the edges giving to this
simple structure a richness and beauty effect that is very
satisfying. Note how Corot, like Turner, brings his greatest light
and dark together in sharp contrast where the rock on the right
cuts the sky.</p>

</div>
<p>Stability is given by the vertical feeling in the central group
of trees and the suggestion of horizontal distance behind the
figure.</p>
<p>It is not only in the larger disposition of the masses in a
composition that this principle of gradated masses and lost and
found edges can be used. Wherever grace and charm are your motive
they should be looked for in the working out of the smallest
details.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>In concluding this chapter I must again insist that knowledge of
these matters will not make you compose a good picture. A
composition may be perfect as far as any rules or principles of
composition go, and yet be of no account whatever. The life-giving
quality in art always defies analysis and refuses to be tabulated
in any formula. This vital quality in drawing and composition must
come from the individual artist himself, and nobody can help him
much here. He must ever be on the look out for those visions his
imagination stirs within him, and endeavour, however haltingly at
first, to give them some sincere expression. Try always when your
mind is filled with some pictorial idea to get something put down,
a mere fumbled expression possibly, but it may contain the germ.
Later on the <a name='Page_217' id="Page_217"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>217</span>same idea may occur to you again, only it will
be less vague this time, and a process of development will have
taken place. It may be years before it takes sufficiently definite
shape to justify a picture; the process of germination in the mind
is a slow one. But try and acquire the habit of making some record
of what pictorial ideas pass in the mind, and don't wait until you
can draw and paint well to begin. Qualities of drawing and painting
don't matter a bit here, it is the sensation, the feeling for the
picture, that is everything.</p>
<p>If knowledge of the rhythmic properties of lines and masses will
not enable you to compose a fine picture, you may well ask what is
their use? There may be those to whom they are of no use. Their
artistic instincts are sufficiently strong to need no direction.
But such natures are rare, and it is doubtful if they ever go far,
while many a painter might be saved a lot of worry over something
in his picture that "won't come" did he but know more of the
principle of pictorial design his work is transgressing. I feel
certain that the old painters, like the Venetians, were far more
systematic and had far more hard and fast principles of design than
ourselves. They knew the science of their craft so well that they
did not so often have to call upon their artistic instinct to get
them out of difficulties. Their artistic instinct was free to
attend to higher things, their knowledge of the science of
picture-making keeping them from many petty mistakes that a modern
artist falls into. The desire of so many artists in these days to
cut loose from tradition and start all over again puts a very
severe strain upon their intuitive faculties, and keeps them
occupied correcting things that more knowledge of <a name=
'Page_218' id="Page_218"></a><span class='pagenum'>218</span>some
of the fundamental principles that don't really alter and that are
the same in all schools would have saved them. Knowledge in art is
like a railway built behind the pioneers who have gone before; it
offers a point of departure for those who come after, further on
into the unknown country of nature's secrets&mdash;a help not
lightly to be discarded.</p>
<p>But all artifice in art must be concealed, <b>a picture
obviously composed is badly composed</b>. In a good composition it
is as though the parts had been carefully placed in rhythmic
relation and then the picture jarred a little, so that everything
is slightly shifted out of place, thus introducing our "dither" or
play of life between the parts. Of course no mechanical jogging
will introduce the vital quality referred to, which must come from
the vitality of the artist's intuition; although I have heard of
photographers jogging the camera in an endeavour to introduce some
artistic "play" in its mechanical renderings. But one must say
something to show how in all good composition the mechanical
principles at the basis of the matter are subordinate to a vital
principle on which the life in the work depends.</p>
<p>This concealment of all artifice, this artlessness and
spontaneity of appearance, is one of the greatest qualities in a
composition, any analysis of which is futile. It is what
occasionally gives to the work of the unlettered genius so great a
charm. But the artist in whom the true spark has not been quenched
by worldly success or other enervating influence, keeps the secret
of this freshness right on, the culture of his student days being
used only to give it splendour of expression, but never to stifle
or suppress its native charm.</p>

BALANCE</h2>
<p>There seems to be a strife between opposing forces at the basis
of all things, a strife in which a perfect balance is never
attained, or life would cease. The worlds are kept on their courses
by such opposing forces, the perfect equilibrium never being found,
and so the vitalising movement is kept up. States are held together
on the same principle, no State seeming able to preserve a balance
for long; new forces arise, the balance is upset, and the State
totters until a new equilibrium has been found. It would seem,
however, to be the aim of life to strive after balance, any violent
deviation from which is accompanied by calamity.</p>
<p>And in art we have the same play of opposing factors, straight
lines and curves, light and dark, warm and cold colour oppose each
other. Were the balance between them perfect, the result would be
dull and dead. But if the balance is very much out, the eye is
disturbed and the effect too disquieting. It will naturally be in
pictures that aim at repose that this balance will be most perfect.
In more exciting subjects less will be necessary, but some amount
should exist in every picture, no matter how turbulent its motive;
as in good tragedy the horror of the situation is never allowed to
overbalance the beauty of the treatment.</p>
<a name='Page_220' id="Page_220"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>220</span>
<div class='sidenote'>Between Straight Lines and Curves</div>
<p>Let us consider in the first place the balance between straight
lines and curves. The richer and fuller the curves, the more severe
should be the straight lines that balance them, if perfect repose
is desired. But if the subject demands excess of movement and life,
of course there will be less necessity for the balancing influence
of straight lines. And on the other hand, if the subject demands an
excess of repose and contemplation, the bias will be on the side of
straight lines. But a picture composed entirely of rich, rolling
curves is too disquieting a thing to contemplate, and would become
very irritating. Of the two extremes, one composed entirely of
straight lines would be preferable to one with no squareness to
relieve the richness of the curves. For straight lines are
significant of the deeper and more permanent things of life, of the
powers that govern and restrain, and of infinity; while the rich
curves (that is, curves the farthest removed from the straight
line) seem to be expressive of uncontrolled energy and the more
exuberant joys of life. Vice may be excess in any direction, but
asceticism has generally been accepted as a nobler vice than
voluptuousness. The rococo art of the eighteenth century is an
instance of the excessive use of curved forms, and, like all
excesses in the joys of life, it is vicious and is the favourite
style of decoration in vulgar places of entertainment. The
excessive use of straight lines and square forms may be seen in
some ancient Egyptian architecture, but this severity was
originally, no doubt, softened by the use of colour, and in any
case it is nobler and finer than the vicious cleverness of rococo
art.</p>
<p><a name='Page_221' id="Page_221"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>221</span>We have seen how the Greeks balanced the
straight lines of their architectural forms with the rich lines of
the sculpture which they used so lavishly on their temples. But the
balance was always kept on the side of the square forms and never
on the side of undue roundness. And it is on this side that the
balance would seem to be in the finest art. Even the finest curves
are those that approach the straight line rather than the circle,
that err on the side of flatnesses rather than roundnesses.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Between Flat and Gradated Tones</div>
<p>What has been said about the balance of straight lines and
curves applies equally well to tones, if for straight lines you
substitute flat tones, and for curved lines gradated tones. The
deeper, more permanent things find expression in the wider, flatter
tones, while an excess of gradations makes for prettiness, if not
for the gross roundnesses of vicious modelling.</p>
<p>Often when a picture is hopelessly out of gear and "mucked up,"
as they say in the studio, it can be got on the right road again by
reducing it to a basis of flat tones, going over it and painting
out the gradations, getting it back to a simpler equation from
which the right road to completion can be more readily seen.
Overmuch concern with the gradations of the smaller modelling is a
very common reason of pictures and drawings getting out of gear.
The less expenditure of tone values you can express your modelling
with, the better, as a general rule. The balance in the finest work
is usually on the side of flat tones rather than on the side of
gradated tones. Work that errs on the side of gradations, like that
of Greuze, however popular its appeal, is much poorer stuff
<a name='Page_222' id="Page_222"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>222</span>than work that errs on the side of flatness in
tone, like Giotto and the Italian primitives, or Puvis de Chavannes
among the moderns.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Between Light and Dark Tones.</div>
<p>There is a balance of tone set up also between light and dark,
between black and white in the scale of tone. Pictures that do not
go far in the direction of light, starting from a middle tone,
should not go far in the direction of dark either. In this respect
note the pictures of Whistler, a great master in matters of tone;
his lights seldom approach anywhere near white, and, on the other
hand, his darks never approach black in tone. When the highest
lights are low in tone, the darkest darks should be high in tone.
Painters like Rembrandt, whose pictures when fresh must have
approached very near white in the high lights, also approach black
in the darks, and nearer our own time, Frank Holl forced the whites
of his pictures very high and correspondingly the darks were very
heavy. And when this balance is kept there is a rightness about it
that is instinctively felt. We do not mean that the <b>amount</b>
of light tones in a picture should be balanced by the <b>amount</b>
of dark tones, but that there should be some balance between the
extremes of light and dark used in the tone scheme of a picture.
The old rule was, I believe, that a picture should be two-thirds
light and one-third dark. But I do not think there is any rule to
be observed here: there are too many exceptions, and no mention is
made of half tones.</p>
<p>Like all so-called laws in art, this rule is capable of many
apparent exceptions. There is the white picture in which all the
tones are high. But in some of the most successful of these you
will generally <a name='Page_223' id="Page_223"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>223</span>find spots of intensely dark pigment. Turner
was fond of these light pictures in his later manner, but he
usually put in some dark spot, such as the black gondolas in some
of his Venetian pictures, that illustrate the law of balance we are
speaking of, and are usually put in excessively dark in proportion
as the rest of the picture is excessively light.</p>
<p>The successful one-tone pictures are generally painted in the
middle tones, and thus do not in any way contradict our principle
of balance.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Between Warm and Cold Colours.</div>
<p>One is tempted at this point to wander a little into the
province of colour, where the principle of balance of which we are
speaking is much felt, the scale here being between warm and cold
colours. If you divide the solar spectrum roughly into half, you
will have the reds, oranges, and yellows on one side, and the
purples, blues, and greens on the other, the former being roughly
the warm and the latter the cold colours. The clever manipulation
of the opposition between these warm and cold colours is one of the
chief means used in giving vitality to colouring. But the point to
notice here is that the further your colouring goes in the
direction of warmth, the further it will be necessary to go in the
opposite direction, to right the balance. That is how it comes
about that painters like Titian, who loved a warm, glowing, golden
colouring, so often had to put a mass of the coldest blue in their
pictures. Gainsborough's "Blue Boy," although done in defiance of
Reynolds' principle, is no contradiction of our rule, for although
the boy has a blue dress all the rest of the picture is warm brown
and so the balance is kept. It is the failure to observe this
<a name='Page_224' id="Page_224"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>224</span>balance that makes so many of the red-coated
huntsmen and soldiers' portraits in our exhibitions so
objectionable. They are too often painted on a dark, hot, burnt
sienna and black background, with nothing but warm colours in the
flesh, &amp;c., with the result that the screaming heat is
intolerable. With a hot mass of red like a huntsman's coat in your
picture, the coolest colour should be looked for everywhere else.
Seen in a November landscape, how well a huntsman's coat looks, but
then, how cold and grey is the colouring of the landscape. The
right thing to do is to support your red with as many cool and
neutral tones as possible and avoid hot shadows. With so strong a
red, blue might be too much of a contrast, unless your canvas was
large enough to admit of its being introduced at some distance from
the red.</p>
<p>Most painters, of course, are content to keep to middle courses,
never going very far in the warm or cold directions. And,
undoubtedly, much more freedom of action is possible here, although
the results may not be so powerful. But when beauty and refinement
of sentiment rather than force are desired, the middle range of
colouring (that is to say, all colours partly neutralised by
admixture with their opposites) is much safer.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Between Interest and Mass.</div>
<p>There is another form of balance that must be although it is
connected more with the subject matter of art, as it concerns the
mental significance of objects rather than rhythmic qualities
possessed by lines and masses; I refer to the balance there is
between interest and mass. The all-absorbing interest of the human
figure makes it often when quite minute in scale balance the weight
and interest of a great <a name='Page_225' id=
"Page_225"></a><span class='pagenum'>225</span>mass. Diagram XXVII
is a rough instance of what is meant. Without the little figure the
composition would be out of balance. But the weight of interest
centred upon that lonely little person is enough to right the
balance occasioned by the great mass of trees on the left. Figures
are largely used by landscape painters in this way, and are of
great use in restoring balance in a picture.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Between Variety and Unity.</div>
<p>And lastly, there must be a balance struck between variety and
unity. A great deal has already been said about this, and it will
only be necessary to recapitulate here that to variety is due all
the expression or the picturesque, of the joyous energy of life,
and all that makes the world such a delightful place, but that to
unity belongs the relating of this variety to the underlying
bed-rock principles that support it in nature and in all good art.
It will depend on the nature of the artist and on the nature of his
theme how far this underlying unity will dominate the expression in
his work; and how far it will be overlaid and hidden behind a rich
garment of variety.</p>
<p><a name='Page_226' id="Page_226"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>226</span>But both ideas must be considered in his work.
If the unity of his conception is allowed to exclude variety
entirely, it will result in a dead abstraction, and if the variety
is to be allowed none of the restraining influences of unity, it
will develop into a riotous extravagance.</p>

RHYTHM: PROPORTION</h2>
<p>Rules and canons of proportion designed to reduce to a
mathematical formula the things that move us in beautiful objects,
have not been a great success; the beautiful will always defy such
clumsy analysis. But however true it is that beauty of proportion
must ever be the result of the finer senses of the artist, it is
possible that canons of proportion, such as those of the human
body, may be of service to the artist by offering some standard
from which he can depart at the dictates of his artistic instinct.
There appears to be no doubt that the ancient sculptors used some
such system. And many of the renaissance painters were interested
in the subject, Leonardo da Vinci having much to say about it in
his book.</p>
<p>Like all scientific knowledge in art, it fails to trap the
elusive something that is the vital essence of the whole matter,
but such scientific knowledge does help to bring one's work up to a
high point of mechanical perfection, from which one's artistic
instinct can soar with a better chance of success than if no
scientific scaffolding had been used in the initial building up.
Yet, however perfect your system, don't forget that the life, the
"dither," will still have to be accounted for, and no science will
help you here.</p>
<p>The idea that certain mathematical proportions <a name='Page_228'
id="Page_228"></a><span class='pagenum'>228</span>or
relationships underlie the phenomena we call beauty is very
ancient, and too abstruse to trouble us here. But undoubtedly
proportion, the quantitative relation of the parts to each other
and to the whole, forms a very important part in the impression
works of art and objects give us, and should be a subject of the
greatest consideration in planning your work. The mathematical
relationship of these quantities is a subject that has always
fascinated scholars, who have measured the antique statues
accurately and painstakingly to find the secret of their charm.
Science, by showing that different sounds and different colours are
produced by waves of different lengths, and that therefore
different colours and sounds can be expressed in terms of numbers,
has certainly opened the door to a new consideration of this
subject of beauty in relation to mathematics. And the result of
such an inquiry, if it is being or has been carried on, will be of
much interest.</p>
<p>But there is something chilling to the artist in an array of
dead figures, for he has a consciousness that the life of the whole
matter will never be captured by such mechanical means.</p>
<p>The question we are interested to ask here is: are there
particular sentiments connected with the different relations of
quantities, their proportions, as we found there were in connection
with different arrangements of lines and masses? Have abstract
proportions any significance in art, as we found abstract line and
mass arrangements had? It is a difficult thing to be definite
about, and I can only give my own feeling on the matter; but I
think in some degree they have.</p>
<p>Proportion can be considered from our two points of view of
unity and variety. In so far as <a name='Page_229' id=
"Page_229"></a><span class='pagenum'>229</span>the proportions of
any picture or object resolve themselves into a simple, easily
grasped unity of relationship, a sense of repose and sublimity is
produced. In so far as the variety of proportion in the different
parts is assertive and prevents the eye grasping the arrangement as
a simple whole, a sense of the lively restlessness of life and
activity is produced. In other words, as we found in line
arrangements, unity makes for sublimity, while variety makes for
the expression of life. Of course the scale of the object will have
something to do with this. That is to say, the most sublimely
proportioned dog-kennel could never give us the impression of
sublimity produced by a great temple. In pictures the scale of the
work is not of so great importance, a painting or drawing having
the power of giving the impression of great size on a small
scale.</p>
<p>The proportion that is most easily grasped is the half&mdash;two
equal parts. This is the most devoid of variety, and therefore of
life, and is only used when an effect of great repose and aloofness
from life is wanted; and even then, never without some variety in
the minor parts to give vitality. The third and the quarter, and in
fact any equal proportions, are others that are easily grasped and
partake in a lesser degree of the same qualities as the half. So
that equality of proportion should be avoided except on those rare
occasions when effects remote from nature and life are desired.
Nature seems to abhor equalities, never making two things alike or
the same proportion if she can help it. All systems founded on
equalities, as are so many modern systems of social reform, are
man's work, the products of a machine-made age. For this is the
difference between nature and the <a name='Page_230' id=
"Page_230"></a><span class='pagenum'>230</span>machine: nature
never produces two things alike, the machine never produces two
things different. Man could solve the social problem to-morrow if
you could produce him equal units. But if all men were alike and
equal, where would be the life and fun of existence? it would
depart with the variety. And in proportion, as in life, variety is
the secret of vitality, only to be suppressed where a static effect
is wanted. In architecture equality of proportion is more often met
with, as the static qualities of repose are of more importance here
than in painting. One meets it on all fine buildings in such things
as rows of columns and windows of equal size and distances apart,
or the continual repetition of the same forms in mouldings, &amp;c.
But even here, in the best work, some variety is allowed to keep
the effect from being quite dead, the columns on the outside of a
Greek pediment being nearer together and leaning slightly inwards,
and the repeated forms of windows, columns, and mouldings being
infinitely varied in themselves. But although you often find
repetitions of the same forms equidistant in architecture, it is
seldom that equality of proportion is observable in the main
distribution of the large masses.</p>
<p>Let us take our simple type of composition, and in Diagram
XXVIII, A, put the horizon across the centre and an upright post
cutting it in the middle of the picture. And let us introduce two
spots that may indicate the position of birds in the upper spaces
on either side of this.</p>
<p>Here we have a maximum of equality and the deadest and most
static of results.</p>
<p>To see these diagrams properly it is necessary to cover over
with some pieces of notepaper all but <a name='Page_231' id=
"Page_231"></a><span class='pagenum'>231</span>the one being
considered, as they affect each other when seen together, and the
quality of their proportion is not so readily observed.</p>

<p>THE ANSIDEI MADONNA. BY RAPHAEL (NATIONAL GALLERY)</p>
<p>A typical example of static balance in composition.</p>
<p><i>Photo Hanfstaengl</i></p>
</div>
<p>In many pictures of the Madonna, when a hush and reverence are
desired rather than exuberant life, the figure is put in the centre
of the canvas, equality of proportion existing between the spaces
on either side of her. But having got the repose this
centralisation gives, everything is done to conceal this equality,
and variety in the contours on either side, and in any figures
there may be, is carefully sought. Raphael's "Ansidei Madonna," in
the National Gallery, is an instance of this (p. 230). You have
first the centralisation of the figure of the Madonna with the
throne on which she sits, exactly in the middle of the picture. Not
only is the throne in the centre of the picture, but its width is
exactly that of the spaces on either side of it, giving us three
equal proportions across the picture. Then you have the circular
lines of the arches behind, curves possessed of the least possible
amount of variety and therefore the calmest and most reposeful;
while the horizontal lines of the steps and the vertical lines of
the throne and architecture, and also the rows of hanging beads
give further emphasis to this infinity of calm. But when we come to
the figures this symmetry has been varied everywhere. All the heads
swing towards the right, while the lines of the draperies swing
freely in many directions. The swing of the heads towards the right
is balanced and the eye brought back to equilibrium by the
strongly-insisted-upon staff of St. Nicholas on the right. The
staff of St. John necessary to balance this line somewhat, is very
slightly insisted on, being represented transparent <a name=
'Page_235' id="Page_235"></a><span class='pagenum'>235</span>as if
made of glass, so as not to increase the swing to the right
occasioned by the heads. It is interesting to note the fruit
introduced at the last moment in the right-hand lower corner,
dragged in, as it were, to restore the balance occasioned by the
figure of the Christ being on the left. In the writer's humble
opinion the extremely obvious artifice with which the lines have
been balanced, and the severity of the convention of this
composition generally, are out of harmony with the amount of
naturalistic detail and particularly of solidity allowed in the
treatment of the figures and accessories. The small amount of truth
to visual nature in the work of earlier men went better with the
formality of such compositions. With so little of the variety of
life in their treatment of natural appearances, one was not led to
demand so much of the variety of life in the arrangement. It is the
simplicity and remoteness from the full effect of natural
appearances in the work of the early Italian schools that made
their painting such a ready medium for the expression of religious
subjects. This atmosphere of other-worldliness where the music of
line and colour was uninterrupted by any aggressive look of real
things is a better convention for the expression of such ideas and
emotions.</p>

<p>C, F, I</p>
</div>
<p>In B and C the proportions of the third and the quarter are
shown, producing the same static effect as the half, although not
so completely.</p>
<p>At D, E, F the same number of lines and spots as we have at A,
B, C have been used, but varied as to size and position, so that
they have no obvious mechanical relationship. The result is an
expression of much more life and character.</p>
<p>At G, H, I more lines and spots have been <a name='Page_236' id=
"Page_236"></a><span class='pagenum'>236</span>added. At G they are
equidistant and dead from lack of variety, while at H and I they
are varied to a degree that prevents the eye grasping any obvious
relationship between them. They have consequently a look of
liveliness and life very different from A, B, C, or G. It will be
observed that as the amount of variety increases so does the life
and liveliness of the impression.</p>
<p>In these diagrams a certain static effect is kept up throughout,
on account of our lines being vertical and horizontal only, which
lines, as we saw in an earlier chapter, are the calmest we have.
But despite this, I think the added life due to the variety in the
proportions is sufficiently apparent in the diagrams to prove the
point we wish to make.</p>
<p>As a contrast to the infinite calm of Raphael's "Madonna," we
have reproduced Tintoretto's "Finding of the Body of St. Mark," in
the Brera Gallery, Milan. Here all is life and movement. The
proportions are infinitely varied, nowhere does the eye grasp any
obvious mathematical relationship. We have the same semi-circular
arches as in the Raphael, but not symmetrically placed, and their
lines everywhere varied, and their calm effect destroyed by the
flickering lights playing about them. Note the great emphasis given
to the outstretched hand of the powerful figure of the Apostle on
the left by the lines of the architecture and the line of arm of
the kneeling figure in the centre of the picture converging on this
hand and leading the eye immediately to it. There is here no static
symmetry, all is energy and force. Starting with this arresting
arm, the eye is led down the majestic figure of St. Mark, past the
recumbent figure, and across the picture by means of the band of
light on the ground, to the <a name='Page_237' id=
"Page_237"></a><span class='pagenum'>237</span>important group of
frightened figures on the right. And from them on to the figures
engaged in lowering a corpse from its tomb. Or, following the
direction of the outstretched arm of St. Mark, we are led by the
lines of the architecture to this group straight away, and back
again by means of the group on the right and the band of light on
the ground. The quantities are not placed in reposeful symmetry
about the canvas, as was the case in the Raphael, but are thrown
off apparently haphazard from lines leading the eye round the
picture. Note also the dramatic intensity given by the strongly
contrasted light and shade, and how Tintoretto has enjoyed the
weird effect of the two figures looking into a tomb with a light,
their shadows being thrown on the lid they hold open, at the far
end of the room. This must have been an amazingly new piece of
realism at the time, and is wonderfully used, to give an eerie
effect to the darkened end of the room. With his boundless energy
and full enjoyment of life, Tintoretto's work naturally shows a
strong leaning towards variety, and his amazing compositions are a
liberal education in the innumerable and unexpected ways in which a
panel can be filled, and should be carefully studied by
students.</p>

</div>
<p>A pleasing proportion that often occurs in nature and art is one
that may be roughly stated in figures as that between 5 and 8. In
such a proportion the eye sees no mathematical relationship. Were
it less than 5, it would be too near the proportion of 4 to 8 (or
one-third the total length), a dull proportion; or were it more, it
would be approaching too near equality of proportion to be quite
satisfactory.</p>
<p>I have seen a proportional compass, imported from Germany,
giving a relationship similar to this <a name='Page_238' id=
"Page_238"></a><span class='pagenum'>238</span>and said to contain
the secret of good proportion. There is certainly something
remarkable about it, and in the Appendix, page <a href=
'#Page_289'>289</a>, you will find some further interesting facts
about this.</p>
<p>The variety of proportions in a building, a picture, or a piece
of sculpture should always be under the control of a few simple,
dominant quantities that simplify the appearance and give it a
unity which is readily grasped except where violence and lack of
repose are wanted. The simpler the proportion is, the more sublime
will be the impression, and the more complicated, the livelier and
more vivacious the effect. From a few well-chosen large proportions
the eye may be led on to enjoy the smaller varieties. But in good
proportion the lesser parts are not allowed to obtrude, but are
kept in subordination to the main dispositions on which the unity
of the effect depends.</p>

<h2>XVII<br />
PORTRAIT DRAWING</h2>
<p>There is something in every individual that is likely for a long
time to defy the analysis of science. When you have summed up the
total of atoms or electrons or whatever it is that goes to the
making of the tissues and also the innumerable complex functions
performed by the different parts, you have not yet got on the track
of the individual that governs the whole performance. The effect of
this personality on the outward form, and the influence it has in
modifying the aspect of body and features, are the things that
concern the portrait draughtsman: the seizing on and expressing
forcefully the individual character of the sitter, as expressed by
his outward appearance.</p>
<p>This character expression in form has been thought to be
somewhat antagonistic to beauty, and many sitters are shy of the
particular characteristics of their own features. The fashionable
photographer, knowing this, carefully stipples out of his negative
any <b>striking</b> characteristics in the form of his sitter the
negative may show. But judging by the result, it is doubtful
whether any beauty has been gained, and certain that interest and
vitality have been lost in the process. Whatever may be the nature
of beauty, it is obvious that what makes one object more beautiful
than another <a name='Page_240' id="Page_240"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>240</span>is something that is characteristic of the
appearance of the one and not of the other: so that some close
study of individual characteristics must be the aim of the artist
who would seek to express beauty, as well as the artist who seeks
the expression of character and professes no interest in
beauty.</p>
<p>Catching the likeness, as it is called, is simply seizing on the
essential things that belong only to a particular individual and
differentiate that individual from others, and expressing them in a
forceful manner. There are certain things that are common to the
whole species, likeness to a common type; the individual likeness
is not in this direction but at the opposite pole to it.</p>
<p>It is one of the most remarkable things connected with the
amazing subtlety of appreciation possessed by the human eye, that
of the millions of heads in the world, and probably of all that
have ever existed in the world, no two look exactly alike. When one
considers how alike they are, and how very restricted is the range
of difference between them, is it not remarkable how quickly the
eye recognises one person from another? It is more remarkable still
how one sometimes recognises a friend not seen for many years, and
whose appearance has changed considerably in the meantime. And this
likeness that we recognise is not so much as is generally thought a
matter of the individual features. If one sees the eye alone, the
remainder of the face being covered, it is almost impossible to
recognise even a well-known friend, or tell whether the expression
is that of laughing or crying. And again, how difficult it is to
recognise anybody when the eyes are masked and only the lower part
of the face visible.</p>

<p>FROM A DRAWING IN RED CHALK BY HOLBEIN IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM

the eyes and on either side of the mouth, etc.</p>
</div>
<p><a name='Page_241' id="Page_241"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>241</span>If you try and recall a well-known head it will
not be the shape of the features that will be recollected so much
as an impression, the result of all these combined, a sort of chord
of which the features will be but the component elements. It is the
relation of the different parts to this chord, this impression of
the personality of a head, that is the all-important thing in what
is popularly called "catching the likeness." In drawing a portrait
the mind must be centred on this, and all the individual parts
drawn in relation to it. The moment the eye gets interested solely
in some individual part and forgets the consideration of its
relationship to this whole impression, the likeness suffers.</p>
<p>Where there is so much that is similar in heads, it is obvious
that what differences there are must be searched out and seized
upon forcefully, if the individuality of the head is to be made
telling. The drawing of portraits should therefore be approached
from the direction of these differences; that is to say, the things
in general disposition and proportion in which your subject differs
from a common type, should be first sought for, the things common
to all heads being left to take care of themselves for a bit. The
reason for this is that the eye, when fresh, sees these differences
much more readily than after it has been working for some time. The
tendency of a tired eye is to see less differentiation, and to hark
back to a dull uniformity; so get in touch at once with the vital
differences while your eye is fresh and your vision keen.</p>
<p>Look out first for the character of the disposition of the
features, note the proportions down an imagined centre line, of the
brows, the base of the nose, the mouth and chin, and get the
character <a name='Page_242' id="Page_242"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>242</span>of the shape of the enclosing line of the face
blocked out in square lines. The great importance of getting these
proportions right early cannot be over-emphasised, as any mistake
may later on necessitate completely shifting a carefully drawn
feature. And the importance of this may be judged from the fact
that you recognise a head a long way off, before anything but the
general disposition of the masses surrounding the features can be
seen. The shape of the skull, too, is another thing of which to get
an early idea, and its relation to the face should be carefully
noted. But it is impossible to lay down hard and fast rules for
these things.</p>
<p>Some artists begin in point drawing with the eyes, and some
leave the eyes until the very last. Some draughtsmen are never
happy until they have an eye to adjust the head round, treating it
as the centre of interest and drawing the parts relatively to it.
While others say, with some truth, that there is a mesmeric effect
produced when the eye is drawn that blinds one to the cold-blooded
technical consideration of a head as line and tone in certain
relationships; that it is as well to postpone until the last that
moment when the shapes and tones that represent form in your
drawing shall be lit up by the introduction of the eye to the look
of a live person. One is freer to consider the accuracy of one's
form before this disturbing influence is introduced. And there is a
good deal to be said for this.</p>
<p>Although in point drawing you can, without serious effect, begin
at any part that interests you, in setting out a painting I think
there can be no two opinions as to the right way to go about it.
The character of the general disposition of the <a name='Page_243'
id="Page_243"></a><span class='pagenum'>243</span>masses must be
first constructed. And if this general blocking in has been well
done, the character of the sitter will be apparent from the first
even in this early stage; and you will be able to judge of the
accuracy of your blocking out by whether or not it does suggest the
original. If it does not, correct it before going any further,
working, as it were, from the general impression of the masses of
the head as seen a long way off, adding more and more detail, and
gradually bringing the impression nearer, until the completed head
is arrived at, thus getting in touch from the very first with the
likeness which should dominate the work all along.</p>

</div>
<p>There are many points of view from which a portrait can be
drawn&mdash;I mean, mental points of view. And, as in a biography,
the value of the work will depend on the insight and distinction of
the author or artist. The valet of a great man might write a
biography of his master that could be quite true to his point of
view; but, assuming him to be an average valet, it would not be a
great work. I believe the gardener of Darwin when asked how his
master was, said, "Not at all well. You see, he moons about all
day. I've seen him staring at a flower for five or ten minutes at a
time. Now, if he had some work to do, he would be much better." A
really great biography cannot be written except by a man who can
comprehend his subject and take a wide view of his position among
men, sorting what is trivial from what is essential, what is common
to all men from what is particular to the subject of his work. And
it is very much the same in portraiture. It is only the painter who
possesses the intuitive faculty for seizing on the significant
things in the form expression of his subject, of <a name='Page_244'
id="Page_244"></a><span class='pagenum'>244</span>disentangling
what is trivial from what is important; and who can convey this
forcibly to the beholder on his canvas, more forcibly than a casual
sight of the real person could do&mdash;it is only this painter who
can hope to paint a really fine portrait.</p>
<p>It is true, the honest and sincere expression of any painter
will be of some interest, just as the biography written by Darwin's
gardener might be; but there is a vast difference between this
point of view and that of the man who thoroughly comprehends his
subject.</p>
<p>Not that it is necessary for the artist to grasp the mind of his
sitter, although that is no disadvantage. But this is not his point
of view, his business is with the effect of this inner man on his
outward appearance. And it is necessary for him to have that
intuitive power that seizes instinctively on those variations of
form that are expressive of this inner man. The habitual cast of
thought in any individual affects the shape and moulds the form of
the features, and, to the discerning, the head is expressive of the
person; both the bigger and the smaller person, both the larger and
the petty characteristics everybody possesses. And the fine
portrait will express the larger and subordinate the petty
individualities, will give you what is of value, and subordinate
what is trivial in a person's appearance.</p>
<p>The pose of the head is a characteristic feature about people
that is not always given enough attention in portraits. The
habitual cast of thought affects its carriage to a very large
degree. The two extreme types of what we mean are the strongly
emotional man who carries his head high, drinking <a name=
'Page_245' id="Page_245"></a><span class='pagenum'>245</span>in
impressions as he goes through the world; and the man of deep
thought who carries his head bent forward, his back bent in
sympathy with it. Everybody has some characteristic action in the
way that should be looked out for and that is usually absent when a
sitter first appears before a painter on the studio throne. A
little diplomacy and conversational humouring is necessary to
produce that unconsciousness that will betray the man in his
appearance.</p>
<p>How the power to discover these things can be acquired, it is,
of course, impossible to teach. All the student can do is to
familiarise himself with the best examples of portraiture, in the
hope that he may be stimulated by this means to observe finer
qualities in nature and develop the best that is in him. But he
must never be insincere in his work. If he does not appreciate fine
things in the work of recognised masters, let him stick to the
honest portrayal of what he does see in nature. The only
distinction of which he is capable lies in this direction. It is
not until he awakens to the sight in nature of qualities he may
have admired in others' work that he is in a position honestly to
introduce them into his own performances.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Probably the most popular point of view in portraiture at
present is the one that can be described as a "striking presentment
of the live person." This is the portrait that arrests the crowd in
an exhibition. You cannot ignore it, vitality bursts from it, and
everything seems sacrificed to this quality of striking
lifelikeness. And some very wonderful modern portraits have been
painted from this point of view. But have we not sacrificed too
much to this quality of vitality? Here is a lady <a name='Page_246'
id="Page_246"></a><span class='pagenum'>246</span>hurriedly getting
up from a couch, there a gentleman stepping out of the frame to
greet you, violence and vitality everywhere. But what of repose,
harmony of colour and form, and the wise ordering and selecting of
the materials of vision that one has been used to in the great
portraiture of the past? While the craftsman in one is staggered
and amazed at the brilliant virtuosity of the thing, the artist in
one resents the sacrifice of so much for what is, after all, but a
short-lived excitement. Age may, no doubt, improve some of the
portraits of this class by quieting them in colour and tone. And
those that are good in design and arrangement will stand this
without loss of distinction, but those in which everything has been
sacrificed to this striking lifelike quality will suffer
considerably. This particular quality depends so much on the
freshness of the paint that when this is mellowed and its vividness
is lost, nothing will remain of value, if the quieter qualities of
design and arrangement have been sacrificed for it.</p>
<p>Frans Hals is the only old master I can think of with whom this
form of portrait can be compared. But it will be noticed that
besides designing his canvases carefully, he usually balanced the
vigour and vitality of his form with a great sobriety of colour. In
fact, in some of his later work, where this restless vitality is
most in evidence, the colour is little more than black and white,
with a little yellow ochre and Venetian red. It is this extreme
reposefulness of colour that opposes the unrest in the form and
helps to restore the balance and necessary repose in the picture.
It is interesting to note the restless variety of the edges in
Frans Hal's work, how he never, if he can help it, lets an edge
<a name='Page_247' id="Page_247"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>247</span>run smoothly, but keeps it constantly on the
move, often leaving it quite jagged, and to compare this with what
was said about vitality depending on variety.</p>

</div>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Another point of view is that of the artist who seeks to give a
significant and calm view of the exterior forms of the sitter, an
expressive map of the individuality of those forms, leaving you to
form your own intellectual judgments. A simple, rather formal,
attitude is usually chosen, and the sitter is drawn with searching
honesty. There is a great deal to be said for this point of view in
the hands of a painter with a large appreciation of form and
design. But without these more inspiring qualities it is apt to
have the dulness that attends most literal transcriptions. There
are many instances of this point of view among early portrait
painters, one of the best of which is the work of Holbein. But
then, to a very distinguished appreciation of the subtleties of
form characterisation he added a fine sense of design and colour
arrangement, qualities by no means always at the command of some of
the lesser men of this school.</p>
<p>Every portrait draughtsman should make a pilgrimage to Windsor,
armed with the necessary permission to view the wonderful series of
portrait drawings by this master in the library of the castle. They
are a liberal education in portrait drawing. It is necessary to see
the originals, for it is only after having seen them that one can
properly understand the numerous and well-known reproductions. A
study of these drawings will, I think, reveal the fact that they
are not so literal as is usually thought. Unflinchingly and
unaffectedly <a name='Page_248' id="Page_248"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>248</span>honest they are, but honest not to a cold,
mechanically accurate record of the sitter's appearance, but honest
and accurate to the vital impression of the live sitter made on the
mind of the live artist. This is the difference we were trying to
explain that exists between the academic and the vital drawing, and
it is a very subtle and elusive quality, like all artistic
qualities, to talk about. The record of a vital impression done
with unflinching accuracy, but under the guidance of intense mental
activity, is a very different thing from a drawing done with the
cold, mechanical accuracy of a machine. The one will instantly grip
the attention and give one a vivid sensation in a way that no
mechanically accurate drawing could do, and in a way that possibly
the sight of the real person would not always do. We see numbers of
faces during a day, but only a few with the vividness of which I am
speaking. How many faces in a crowd are passed
indifferently&mdash;there is no vitality in the impression they
make on our mind; but suddenly a face will rivet our attention, and
although it is gone in a flash, the memory of the impression will
remain for some time.</p>
<p>The best of Holbein's portrait drawings give one the impression
of having been seen in one of these flashes and rivet the attention
in consequence. Drawings done under this mental stimulus present
subtle differences from drawings done with cold accuracy. The
drawing of the Lady Audley, here reproduced, bears evidence of some
of this subtle variation on what are called the facts, in the left
eye of the sitter. It will be noticed that the pupil of this eye is
larger than the other. Now I do not suppose that as a matter of
mechanical accuracy this was so, <a name='Page_249' id=
"Page_249"></a><span class='pagenum'>249</span>but the impression
of the eyes seen as part of a vivid impression of the head is
seldom that they are the same size. Holbein had in the first
instance in this very carefully wrought drawing made them so, but
when at the last he was vitalising the impression, "pulling it
together" as artists say, he has deliberately put a line outside
the original one, making this pupil larger. This is not at all
clearly seen in the reproduction, but <b>is distinctly visible in
the original</b>. And to my thinking it was done at the dictates of
the vivid mental impression he wished his drawing to convey. Few
can fail to be struck in turning over this wonderful series of
drawings by the vividness of their portraiture, and the vividness
is due to their being severely accurate to the vital impression on
the mind of Holbein, not merely to the facts coldly observed.</p>

<hr class='short' />
<p>Another point of view is that of seeking in the face a symbol of
the person within, and selecting those things about a head that
express this. As has already been said, the habitual attitude of
mind has in the course of time a marked influence on the form of
the face, and in fact of the whole body, so that&mdash;to those who
can see&mdash;the man or woman is a visible symbol of themselves.
But this is by no means apparent to all.</p>
<p>The striking example of this class is the splendid series of
portraits by the late G.F. Watts. Looking at these heads one is
made conscious of the people in a fuller, deeper sense than if they
were before one in the flesh. For Watts sought to discover the
person in their appearance and to paint a picture that should be a
living symbol of them. He took pains to find out all he could about
the mind of <a name='Page_250' id="Page_250"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>250</span>his sitters before he painted them, and sought
in the appearance the expression of this inner man. So that whereas
with Holbein it was the vivid presentation of the impression as one
might see a head that struck one in a crowd, with Watts it is the
spirit one is first conscious of. The thunders of war appear in the
powerful head of Lord Lawrence, the music of poetry in the head of
Swinburne, and the dry atmosphere of the higher regions of thought
in the John Stuart Mill, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In the National Portrait Gallery there are two paintings of the
poet Robert Browning, one by Rudolph Lehmann and one by Watts. Now
the former portrait is probably much more "like" the poet as the
people who met him casually saw him. But Watts's portrait is like
the man who wrote the poetry, and Lehmann's is not. Browning was a
particularly difficult subject in this respect, in that to a casual
observer there was much more about his external appearance to
suggest a prosperous man of business, than the fiery zeal of the
poet.</p>
<p>These portraits by Watts will repay the closest study by the
student of portraiture. They are full of that wise selection by a
great mind that lifts such work above the triviality of the
commonplace to the level of great imaginative painting.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Another point of view is that of treating the sitter as part of
a symphony of form and colour, and subordinating everything to this
artistic consideration. This is very fashionable at the present
time, and much beautiful work is being done with this motive. And
with many ladies who would not, I hope, object to one's saying that
their principal characteristic was the charm of their appearance,
<a name='Page_251' id="Page_251"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>251</span>this point of view offers, perhaps, one of the
best opportunities of a successful painting. A pose is selected
that makes a good design of line and colour&mdash;a good
pattern&mdash;and the character of the sitter is not allowed to
obtrude or mar the symmetry of the whole considered as a beautiful
panel. The portraits of J. McNeill Whistler are examples of this
treatment, a point of view that has very largely influenced modern
portrait painting in England.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Then there is the official portrait in which the dignity of an
office held by the sitter, of which occasion the portrait is a
memorial, has to be considered. The more intimate interest in the
personal character of the sitter is here subordinated to the
interest of his public character and attitude of mind towards his
office. Thus it happens that much more decorative pageantry
symbolic of these things is permissible in this kind of portraiture
than in that of plain Mr. Smith; a greater stateliness of design as
befitting official occasions.</p>
<p>It is not contended that this forms anything like a complete
list of the numerous aspects from which a portrait can be
considered, but they are some of the more extreme of those
prevalent at the present time. Neither is it contended that they
are incompatible with each other: the qualities of two or more of
these points of view are often found in the same work. And it is
not inconceivable that a single portrait might contain all and be a
striking lifelike presentment, a faithful catalogue of all the
features, a symbol of the person and a symphony of form and colour.
But the chances are against such a composite affair being a
success. One or other quality will dominate in a successful work;
<a name='Page_252' id="Page_252"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>252</span>and it is not advisable to try and combine too
many different points of view as, in the confusion of ideas,
directness of expression is lost. But no good portrait is without
some of the qualities of all these points of view, whichever may
dominate the artist's intention.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Expression.</div>
<p>The camera, and more particularly the instantaneous camera, has
habituated people to expect in a portrait a momentary expression,
and of these momentary expressions the faint smile, as we all know,
is an easy first in the matter of popularity. It is no uncommon
thing for the painter to be asked in the early stages of his work
when he is going to put in the smile, it never being questioned
that this is the artist's aim in the matter of expression.</p>
<p>The giving of lifelike expression to a painting is not so simple
a matter as it might appear to be. Could one set the real person
behind the frame and suddenly fix them for ever with one of those
passing expressions on their faces, however natural it might have
been at the moment, fixed for ever it is terrible, and most
unlifelike. As we have already said, a few lines scribbled on a
piece of paper by a consummate artist would give a greater sense of
life than this fixed actuality. It is not ultimately by the pursuit
of the actual realisation that expression and life are conveyed in
a portrait. Every face has expression of a far more interesting and
enduring kind than these momentary disturbances of its form
occasioned by laughter or some passing thought, &amp;c. And it must
never be forgotten that a portrait is a panel painted to remain for
centuries without movement. So that a large amount of the quality
of repose must <a name='Page_253' id="Page_253"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>253</span>enter into its composition. Portraits in which
this has not been borne in mind, however entertaining at a picture
exhibition, when they are seen for a few moments only, pall on one
if constantly seen, and are finally very irritating.</p>
<p>But the real expression in a head is something more enduring
than these passing movements: one that belongs to the forms of a
head, and the marks left on that form by the life and character of
the person. This is of far more interest than those passing
expressions, the results of the contraction of certain muscles
under the skin, the effect of which is very similar in most people.
It is for the portrait painter to find this more enduring
expression and give it noble expression in his work.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Treatment of Clothes.</div>
<p>It is a common idea among sitters that if they are painted in
modern clothes the picture will look old-fashioned in a few years.
If the sitter's appearance were fixed upon the canvas exactly as
they stood before the artist in his studio, without any selection
on the part of the painter, this might be the result, and <i>is</i>
the result in the case of painters who have no higher aim than
this.</p>
<p>But there are qualities in dress that do not belong exclusively
to the particular period of their fashion. Qualities that are the
same in all ages. And when these are insisted upon, and the
frivolities of the moment in dress not troubled about so much, the
portrait has a permanent quality, and will never in consequence
look old-fashioned in the offensive way that is usually meant. In
the first place, the drapery and stuffs of which clothes are made
follow laws in the manner in which they fold <a name='Page_254' id=
"Page_254"></a><span class='pagenum'>254</span>and drape over the
figure, that are the same in all times. If the expression of the
figure through the draperies is sought by the painter, a permanent
quality will be given in his work, whatever fantastic shapes the
cut of the garments may assume.</p>
<p>And further, the artist does not take whatever comes to hand in
the appearance of his sitter, but works to a thought-out
arrangement of colour and form, to a design. This he selects from
the moving and varied appearance of his sitter, trying one thing
after another, until he sees a suggestive arrangement, from the
impression of which he makes his design. It is true that the
extremes of fashion do not always lend themselves so readily as
more reasonable modes to the making of a good pictorial pattern.
But this is not always so, some extreme fashions giving
opportunities of very piquant and interesting portrait designs. So
that, however extreme the fashion, if the artist is able to select
some aspect of it that will result in a good arrangement for his
portrait, the work will never have the offensive old-fashioned
look. The principles governing good designs are the same in all
times; and if material for such arrangement has been discovered in
the most modish of fashions, it has been lifted into a sphere where
nothing is ever out of date.</p>
<p>It is only when the painter is concerned with the trivial
details of fashion for their own sake, for the making his picture
look like the real thing, and has not been concerned with
transmuting the appearance of fashionable clothes by selection into
the permanent realms of form and colour design, that his work will
justify one in saying that it will look stale in a few years.</p>
<p><a name='Page_255' id="Page_255"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>255</span>The fashion of dressing sitters in meaningless,
so-called classical draperies is a feeble one, and usually argues a
lack of capacity for selecting a good arrangement from the clothes
of the period in the artist who adopts it. Modern women's clothes
are full of suggestions for new arrangements and designs quite as
good as anything that has been done in the past. The range of
subtle colours and varieties of texture in materials is amazing,
and the subtlety of invention displayed in some of the designs for
costumes leads one to wonder whether there is not something in the
remark attributed to an eminent sculptor that "designing ladies'
fashions is one of the few arts that is thoroughly vital
to-day."</p>

THE VISUAL MEMORY</h2>
<p>The memory is the great storehouse of artistic material, the
treasures of which the artist may know little about until a chance
association lights up some of its dark recesses. From early years
the mind of the young artist has been storing up impressions in
these mysterious chambers, collected from nature's aspects, works
of art, and anything that comes within the field of vision. It is
from this store that the imagination draws its material, however
fantastic and remote from natural appearances the forms it may
assume.</p>
<p>How much our memory of pictures colours the impressions of
nature we receive is probably not suspected by us, but who could
say how a scene would appear to him, had he never looked at a
picture? So sensitive is the vision to the influence of memory
that, after seeing the pictures of some painter whose work has
deeply impressed us, we are apt, while the memory of it is still
fresh in our minds, to see things as he would paint them. On
different occasions after leaving the National Gallery I can
remember having seen Trafalgar Square as Paolo Veronese, Turner, or
whatever painter may have impressed me in the Gallery, would have
painted it, the memory of their work colouring the impression the
scene produced.</p>
<p><a name='Page_257' id="Page_257"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>257</span>But, putting aside the memory of pictures, let
us consider the place of direct visual memory from nature in our
work, pictures being indirect or second-hand impressions.</p>
<p>We have seen in an earlier chapter how certain painters in the
nineteenth century, feeling how very second-hand and far removed
from nature painting had become, started a movement to discard
studio traditions and study nature with a single eye, taking their
pictures out of doors, and endeavouring to wrest nature's secrets
from her on the spot. The Pre-Raphaelite movement in England and
the Impressionist movement in France were the results of this
impulse. And it is interesting, by the way, to contrast the
different manner in which this desire for more truth to nature
affected the French and English temperaments. The intense
individualism of the English sought out every detail, every leaf
and flower for itself, painting them with a passion and intensity
that made their painting a vivid medium for the expression of
poetic ideas; while the more synthetic mind of the Frenchman
approached this search for visual truth from the opposite point of
view of the whole effect, finding in the large, generalised
impression a new world of beauty. And his more logical mind led him
to inquire into the nature of light, and so to invent a technique
founded on scientific principles.</p>
<p>But now the first blush of freshness has worn off the new
movement, painters have begun to see that if anything but very
ordinary effects are to be attempted, this painting on the spot
must give place to more reliance on the memory.</p>
<p>Memory has this great advantage over direct vision: it retains
more vividly the essential things, <a name='Page_258' id=
"Page_258"></a><span class='pagenum'>258</span>and has a habit of
losing what is unessential to the pictorial impression.</p>
<p>But what is the essential in a painting? What is it makes one
want to paint at all? Ah! Here we approach very debatable and
shadowy ground, and we can do little but ask questions, the answer
to which will vary with each individual temperament. What is it
that these rays of light striking our retina convey to our brain,
and from our brain to whatever is ourselves, in the seat of
consciousness above this? What is this mysterious correspondence
set up between something within and something without, that at
times sends such a clamour of harmony through our whole being? Why
do certain combinations of sound in music and of form and colour in
art affect us so profoundly? What are the laws governing harmony in
the universe, and whence do they come? It is hardly trees and sky,
earth, or flesh and blood, <b>as such</b>, that interest the
artist; but rather that through these things in memorable moments
he is permitted a consciousness of deeper things, and impelled to
seek utterance for what is moving him. It is the record of these
rare moments in which one apprehends truth in things seen that the
artist wishes to convey to others. But these moments, these flashes
of inspiration which are at the inception of every vital picture,
occur but seldom. What the painter has to do is to fix them vividly
in his memory, to snapshot them, as it were, so that they may stand
by him during the toilsome procedure of the painting, and guide the
work.</p>
<p>This initial inspiration, this initial flash in the mind, need
not be the result of a scene in nature, <a name='Page_259' id=
"Page_259"></a><span class='pagenum'>259</span>but may of course be
purely the work of the imagination; a composition, the sense of
which flashes across the mind. But in either case the difficulty is
to preserve vividly the sensation of this original artistic
impulse. And in the case of its having been derived from nature
direct, as is so often the case in modern art, the system of
painting continually on the spot is apt to lose touch with it very
soon. For in the continual observation of anything you have set
your easel before day after day, comes a series of impressions,
more and more commonplace, as the eye becomes more and more
familiar with the details of the subject. And ere long the original
emotion that was the reason of the whole work is lost sight of, and
one of those pictures or drawings giving a catalogue of tired
objects more or less ingeniously arranged (that we all know so
well) is the result&mdash;work utterly lacking in the freshness and
charm of true inspiration. For however commonplace the subject seen
by the artist in one of his "flashes," it is clothed in a newness
and surprise that charm us, be it only an orange on a plate.</p>
<p>Now a picture is a thing of paint upon a flat surface, and a
drawing is a matter of certain marks upon a paper, and how to
translate the intricacies of a visual or imagined impression to the
prosaic terms of masses of coloured pigment or lines and tones is
the business with which our technique is concerned. The ease,
therefore, with which a painter will be able to remember an
impression in a form from which he can work, will depend upon his
power to analyse vision in this technical sense. The more one knows
about what may be called the anatomy of picture-making&mdash;how
certain forms produce certain <a name='Page_260' id=
"Page_260"></a><span class='pagenum'>260</span>effects, certain
colours or arrangements other effects, &amp;c.&mdash;the easier
will it be for him to carry away a visual memory of his subject
that will stand by him during the long hours of his labours at the
picture. The more he knows of the expressive powers of lines and
tones, the more easily will he be able to observe the vital things
in nature that convey the impression he wishes to memorise.</p>
<p>It is not enough to drink in and remember the emotional side of
the matter, although this must be done fully, but if a memory of
the subject is to be carried away that will be of service
technically, the scene must be committed to memory in terms of
whatever medium you intend to employ for reproducing it&mdash;in
the case of a drawing, lines and tones. And the impression will
have to be analysed into these terms as if you were actually
drawing the scene on some imagined piece of paper in your mind. The
faculty of doing this is not to be acquired all at once, but it is
amazing of how much development it is capable. Just as the faculty
of committing to memory long poems or plays can be developed, so
can the faculty of remembering visual things. This subject has
received little attention in art schools until just recently. But
it is not yet so systematically done as it might be. Monsieur Lecoq
de Boisbaudran in France experimented with pupils in this memory
training, beginning with very simple things like the outline of a
nose, and going on to more complex subjects by easy stages, with
the most surprising results. And there is no doubt that a great
deal more can and should be done in this direction than is at
present attempted. What students should do is to form a habit of
making every day in their sketch-book <a name='Page_261' id=
"Page_261"></a><span class='pagenum'>261</span>a drawing of
something they have seen that has interested them, and that they
have made some attempt at memorising. Don't be discouraged if the
results are poor and disappointing at first&mdash;you will find
that by persevering your power of memory will develop and be of the
greatest service to you in your after work. Try particularly to
remember the spirit of the subject, and in this memory-drawing some
scribbling and fumbling will necessarily have to be done. You
cannot expect to be able to draw definitely and clearly from
memory, at least at first, although your aim should always be to
draw as frankly and clearly as you can.</p>

<p>STUDY ON BROWN PAPER IN BLACK AND WHITE CONT&Eacute; CHALK</p>
<p>Illustrating a simple method of studying drapery forms.</p>
</div>
<p>Let us assume that you have found a subject that moves you and
that, being too fleeting to draw on the spot, you wish to commit to
memory. Drink a full enjoyment of it, let it soak in, for the
recollection of this will be of the utmost use to you afterwards in
guiding your memory-drawing. This mental impression is not
difficult to recall; it is the visual impression in terms of line
and tone that is difficult to remember. Having experienced your
full enjoyment of the artistic matter in the subject, you must next
consider it from the material side, as a flat, visual impression,
as this is the only form in which it can be expressed on a flat
sheet of paper. Note the proportions of the main lines, their
shapes and disposition, as if you were drawing it, in fact do the
whole drawing in your mind, memorising the forms and proportions of
the different parts, and fix it in your memory to the smallest
detail.</p>
<p>If only the emotional side of the matter has been remembered,
when you come to draw it you will be hopelessly at sea, as it is
remarkable how <a name='Page_262' id="Page_262"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>262</span>little the memory retains of the appearance of
things constantly seen, if no attempt has been made to memorise
their visual appearance.</p>
<p>The true artist, even when working from nature, works from
memory very largely. That is to say, he works to a scheme in tune
to some emotional enthusiasm with which the subject has inspired
him in the first instance. Nature is always changing, but he does
not change the intention of his picture. He always keeps before him
the initial impression he sets out to paint, and only selects from
nature those things that play up to it. He is a feeble artist, who
copies individually the parts of a scene with whatever effect they
may have at the moment he is doing them, and then expects the sum
total to make a picture. If circumstances permit, it is always as
well to make in the first instance a rapid sketch that shall,
whatever it may lack, at least contain the main disposition of the
masses and lines of your composition seen under the influence of
the enthusiasm that has inspired the work. This will be of great
value afterwards in freshening your memory when in the labour of
the work the original impulse gets dulled. It is seldom that the
vitality of this first sketch is surpassed by the completed work,
and often, alas! it is far from equalled.</p>
<p>In portrait painting and drawing the memory must be used also. A
sitter varies very much in the impression he gives on different
days, and the artist must in the early sittings, when his mind is
fresh, select the aspect he means to paint and afterwards work
largely to the memory of this.</p>
<p>Always work to a scheme on which you have decided, and do not
flounder on in the hope of something <a name='Page_263' id=
"Page_263"></a><span class='pagenum'>263</span>turning up as you go
along. Your faculties are never so active and prone to see
something interesting and fine as when the subject is first
presented to them. This is the time to decide your scheme; this is
the time to take your fill of the impression you mean to convey.
This is the time to learn your subject thoroughly and decide on
what you wish the picture to be. And having decided this, work
straight on, using nature to support your original impression, but
don't be led off by a fresh scheme because others strike you as you
go along. New schemes will do so, of course, and every new one has
a knack of looking better than your original one. But it is not
often that this is so; the fact that they are new makes them appear
to greater advantage than the original scheme to which you have got
accustomed. So that it is not only in working away from nature that
the memory is of use, but actually when working directly in front
of nature.</p>
<p>To sum up, there are two aspects of a subject, the one
luxuriating in the sensuous pleasure of it, with all of spiritual
significance it may consciously or unconsciously convey, and the
other concerned with the lines, tones, shapes, &amp;c., and their
rhythmic ordering, by means of which it is to be
expressed&mdash;the matter and manner, as they may be called. And,
if the artist's memory is to be of use to him in his work, both
these aspects must be memorised, and of the two the second will
need the most attention. But although there are these two aspects
of the subject, and each must receive separate attention when
memorising it, they are in reality only two aspects of the same
thing, which in the act of painting or drawing must be <a name=
'Page_264' id="Page_264"></a><span class='pagenum'>264</span>united
if a work of art is to result. When a subject first flashes upon an
artist he delights in it as a painted or drawn thing, and feels
instinctively the treatment it will require. In good
draughtsmanship the thing felt will guide and govern everything,
every touch will be instinct with the thrill of that first
impression. The craftsman mind, so laboriously built up, should by
now have become an instinct, a second nature, at the direction of a
higher consciousness. At such times the right strokes, the right
tones come naturally and go on the right place, the artist being
only conscious of a fierce joy and a feeling that things are in
tune and going well for once. It is the thirst for this glorious
enthusiasm, this fusing of matter and manner, this act of giving
the spirit within outward form, that spurs the artist on at all
times, and it is this that is the wonderful thing about art.</p>

<h2>XIX<br />
PROCEDURE</h2>
<p>In commencing a drawing, don't, as so many students do, start
carelessly floundering about with your chalk or charcoal in the
hope that something will turn up. It is seldom if ever that an
artist puts on paper anything better than he has in his mind before
he starts, and usually it is not nearly so good.</p>
<p>Don't spoil the beauty of a clean sheet of paper by a lot of
scribble. Try and see in your mind's eye the drawing you mean to
do, and then try and make your hand realise it, making the paper
more beautiful by every touch you give instead of spoiling it by a
slovenly manner of procedure.</p>
<p>To know what you want to do and then to do it is the secret of
good style and technique. This sounds very commonplace, but it is
surprising how few students make it their aim. You may often
observe them come in, pin a piece of paper on their board, draw a
line down the middle, make a few measurements, and start blocking
in the drawing without having given the subject to be drawn a
thought, as if it were all there done before them, and only needed
copying, as a clerk would copy a letter already drafted for
him.</p>
<p>Now, nothing is being said against the practice of drawing guide
lines and taking measurements <a name='Page_266' id=
"Page_266"></a><span class='pagenum'>266</span>and blocking in your
work. This is very necessary in academic work, if rather fettering
to expressive drawing; but even in the most academic drawing the
artistic intelligence must be used, although that is not the kind
of drawing this chapter is particularly referring to.</p>
<p>Look well at the model first; try and be moved by something in
the form that you feel is fine or interesting, and try and see in
your mind's eye what sort of drawing you mean to do before touching
your paper. In school studies be always unflinchingly honest to the
impression the model gives you, but dismiss the camera idea of
truth from your mind. Instead of converting yourself into a
mechanical instrument for the copying of what is before you, let
your drawing be an expression of truth perceived intelligently.</p>
<p>Be extremely careful about the first few strokes you put on your
paper: the quality of your drawing is often decided in these early
stages. If they are vital and expressive, you have started along
lines you can develop, and have some hope of doing a good drawing.
If they are feeble and poor, the chances are greatly against your
getting anything good built upon them. If your start has been bad,
pull yourself together, turn your paper over and start afresh,
trying to seize upon the big, significant lines and swings in your
subject at once. Remember it is much easier to put down a statement
correctly than to correct a wrong one; so out with the whole part
if you are convinced it is wrong. Train yourself to make direct,
accurate statements in your drawings, and don't waste time trying
to manoeuvre a bad drawing into a good one. Stop as soon as you
feel you have gone wrong and correct the work <a name='Page_267'
id="Page_267"></a><span class='pagenum'>267</span>in its early
stages, instead of rushing on upon a wrong foundation in the vague
hope that it will all come right in the end. When out walking, if
you find you have taken a wrong road you do not, if you are wise,
go on in the hope that the wrong way will lead to the right one,
but you turn round and go back to the point at which you left the
right road. It is very much the same in drawing and painting. As
soon as you become aware that you have got upon the wrong track,
stop and rub out your work until an earlier stage that was right is
reached, and start along again from this point. As your eye gets
trained you will more quickly perceive when you have done a wrong
stroke, and be able to correct it before having gone very far along
the wrong road.</p>
<p>Do not work too long without giving your eye a little rest; a
few moments will be quite sufficient. If things won't come, stop a
minute; the eye often gets fatigued very quickly and refuses to see
truly, but soon revives if rested a minute or two.</p>
<p>Do not go labouring at a drawing when your mind is not working;
you are not doing any good, and probably are spoiling any good you
have already done. Pull yourself together, and ask what it is you
are trying to express, and having got this idea firmly fixed in
your mind, go for your drawing with the determination that it shall
express it.</p>
<p>All this will sound very trite to students of any mettle, but
there are large numbers who waste no end of time working in a
purely mechanical, lifeless way, and with their minds anywhere but
concentrated upon the work before them. And if the mind is not
working, the work of the hand will be of no account. My own
experience is that one <a name='Page_268' id=
"Page_268"></a><span class='pagenum'>268</span>has constantly to be
making fresh effort during the procedure of the work. The mind is
apt to tire and needs rousing continually, otherwise the work will
lack the impulse that shall make it vital. Particularly is this so
in the final stages of a drawing or painting, when, in adding
details and small refinements, it is doubly necessary for the mind
to be on fire with the initial impulse, or the main qualities will
be obscured and the result enfeebled by these smaller matters.</p>
<p>Do not rub out, if you can possibly help it, in drawings that
aim at artistic expression. In academic work, where artistic
feeling is less important than the discipline of your faculties,
you may, of course, do so, but even here as little as possible. In
beautiful drawing of any facility it has a weakening effect,
somewhat similar to that produced by a person stopping in the
middle of a witty or brilliant remark to correct a word. If a wrong
line is made, it is left in by the side of the right one in the
drawing of many of the masters. But the great aim of the
draughtsman should be to train himself to draw cleanly and
fearlessly, hand and eye going together. But this state of things
cannot be expected for some time.</p>
<p>Let painstaking accuracy be your aim for a long time. When your
eye and hand have acquired the power of seeing and expressing on
paper with some degree of accuracy what you see, you will find
facility and quickness of execution will come of their own accord.
In drawing of any expressive power this quickness and facility of
execution are absolutely essential. The waves of emotion, under the
influence of which the eye really sees in any artistic sense, do
not last long enough to allow of <a name='Page_269' id=
"Page_269"></a><span class='pagenum'>269</span>a slow, painstaking
manner of execution. There must be no hitch in the machinery of
expression when the consciousness is alive to the realisation of
something fine. Fluency of hand and accuracy of eye are the things
your academic studies should have taught you, and these powers will
be needed if you are to catch the expression of any of the finer
things in form that constitute good drawing.</p>
<p>Try and express yourself in as simple, not as complicated a
manner as possible. Let every touch mean something, and if you
don't see what to do next, don't fill in the time by meaningless
shading and scribbling until you do. Wait awhile, rest your eye by
looking away, and then see if you cannot find something right that
needs doing.</p>
<p>Before beginning a drawing, it is not a bad idea to study
carefully the work of some master draughtsman whom the subject to
be drawn may suggest. If you do this carefully and thoughtfully,
and take in a full enjoyment, your eye will unconsciously be led to
see in nature some of the qualities of the master's work. And you
will see the subject to be drawn as a much finer thing than would
have been the case had you come to it with your eye unprepared in
any way. Reproductions are now so good and cheap that the best
drawings in the world can be had for a few pence, and every student
should begin collecting reproductions of the things that interest
him.</p>
<p>This is not the place to discuss questions of health, but
perhaps it will not be thought grandmotherly to mention the extreme
importance of nervous vitality in a fine draughtsman, and how his
life should be ordered on such healthy lines that he has at his
command the maximum instead of the <a name='Page_270' id=
"Page_270"></a><span class='pagenum'>270</span>minimum of this
faculty. After a certain point, it is a question of vitality how
far an artist is likely to go in art. Given two men of equal
ability, the one leading a careless life and the other a healthy
one, as far as a healthy one is possible to such a supersensitive
creature as an artist, there can be no doubt as to the result. It
is because there is still a lingering idea in the minds of many
that an artist must lead a dissipated life or he is not really an
artist, that one feels it necessary to mention the subject. This
idea has evidently arisen from the inability of the average person
to associate an unconventional mode of life with anything but
riotous dissipation. A conventional life is not the only wholesome
form of existence, and is certainly a most unwholesome and
deadening form to the artist; and neither is a dissipated life the
only unconventional one open to him. It is as well that the young
student should know this, and be led early to take great care of
that most valuable of studio properties, vigorous health.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XX' id="CHAPTER_XX"></a> <a name='Page_271' id=
"Page_271"></a><span class='pagenum'>271</span>
<h2>XX<br />
MATERIALS</h2>
<p>The materials in which the artist works are of the greatest
importance in determining what qualities in the infinite complexity
of nature he selects for expression. And the good draughtsman will
find out the particular ones that belong to whatever medium he
selects for his drawing, and be careful never to attempt more than
it is capable of doing. Every material he works with possesses
certain vital qualities peculiar to itself, and it is his business
to find out what these are and use them to the advantage of his
drawing. When one is working with, say, pen and ink, the necessity
for selecting only certain things is obvious enough. But when a
medium with the vast capacity of oil paint is being used, the
principle of its governing the nature of the work is more often
lost sight of. So near can oil paint approach an actual illusion of
natural appearances, that much misdirected effort has been wasted
on this object, all enjoyment of the medium being subordinated to a
meretricious attempt to deceive the eye. And I believe a popular
idea of the art of painting is that it exists chiefly to produce
this deception. No vital expression of nature can be achieved
without the aid of the particular vitality possessed by the medium
with which one is working. If this is lost sight of and the eye is
<a name='Page_272' id="Page_272"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>272</span>tricked into thinking that it is looking at
real nature, it is not a fine picture. Art is not a substitute for
nature, but an expression of feeling produced in the consciousness
of the artist, and intimately associated with the material through
which it is expressed in his work&mdash;inspired, it may be, in the
first instance, by something seen, and expressed by him in painted
symbols as true to nature as he can make them while keeping in tune
to the emotional idea that prompted the work; but never regarded by
the fine artist as anything but painted symbols nevertheless. Never
for one moment does he intend you to forget that it is a painted
picture you are looking at, however naturalistic the treatment his
theme may demand.</p>
<p>In the earlier history of art it was not so necessary to insist
on the limitations imposed by different mediums. With their more
limited knowledge of the phenomena of vision, the early masters had
not the same opportunities of going astray in this respect. But now
that the whole field of vision has been discovered, and that the
subtlest effects of light and atmosphere are capable of being
represented, it has become necessary to decide how far complete
accuracy of representation will help the particular impression you
may intend your picture or drawing to create. The danger is that in
producing a complete illusion of representation, the particular
vitality of your medium, with all the expressive power it is
capable of yielding, may be lost.</p>
<p>Perhaps the chief difference between the great masters of the
past and many modern painters is the neglect of this principle.
<b>They represented nature in terms of whatever medium they worked
in, and <a name='Page_273' id="Page_273"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>273</span>never overstepped this limitation</b>. Modern
artists, particularly in the nineteenth century, often attempted to
<b>copy nature</b>, the medium being subordinated to the attempt to
make it look like the real thing. In the same way, the drawings of
the great masters were drawings. They did not attempt anything with
a point that a point was not capable of expressing. The drawings of
many modern artists are full of attempts to express tone and colour
effects, things entirely outside the true province of drawing. The
small but infinitely important part of nature that pure drawing is
capable of conveying has been neglected, and line work, until
recently, went out of fashion in our schools.</p>
<p>There is something that makes for power in the limitations your
materials impose. Many artists whose work in some of the more
limited mediums is fine, are utterly feeble when they attempt one
with so few restrictions as oil paint. If students could only be
induced to impose more restraint upon themselves when they attempt
so difficult a medium as paint, it would be greatly to the
advantage of their work. Beginning first with monochrome in three
tones, as explained in a former chapter, they might then take for
figure work ivory black and Venetian red. It is surprising what an
amount of colour effect can be got with this simple means, and how
much can be learned about the relative positions of the warm and
cold colours. Do not attempt the full range of tone at first, but
keep the darks rather lighter and the lights darker than nature.
Attempt the full scale of tone only when you have acquired
sufficient experience with the simpler range, and gradually add
more colours as you learn to master a few. But restraints are
<a name='Page_274' id="Page_274"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>274</span>not so fashionable just now as unbridled
licence. Art students start in with a palette full of the most
amazing colours, producing results that it were better not to
discuss. It is a wise man who can discover his limitations and
select a medium the capacities of which just tally with his own. To
discover this, it is advisable to try many, and below is a short
description of the chief ones used by the draughtsman. But very
little can be said about them, and very little idea of their
capacities given in a written description; they must be handled by
the student, and are no doubt capable of many more qualities than
have yet been got out of them.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Lead Pencil</div>
<p>This well-known medium is one of the most beautiful for pure
line work, and its use is an excellent training to the eye and hand
in precision of observation. Perhaps this is why it has not been so
popular in our art schools lately, when the charms of severe
discipline are not so much in favour as they should be. It is the
first medium we are given to draw with, and as the handiest and
most convenient is unrivalled for sketch-book use.</p>
<p>It is made in a large variety of degrees, from the hardest and
greyest to the softest and blackest, and is too well known to need
much description. It does not need fixing.</p>
<p>For pure line drawing nothing equals it, except silver point,
and great draughtsmen, like Ingres, have always loved it. It does
not lend itself so readily to any form of mass drawing. Although it
is sometimes used for this purpose, the offensive shine that occurs
if dark masses are introduced is against its use in any but very
lightly shaded work.</p>

<p>FROM A SILVER-POINT DRAWING</p>
</div>
<p><a name='Page_275' id="Page_275"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>275</span>Its charm is the extreme delicacy of its
grey-black lines.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Silver and Gold Point.</div>
<p>Similar to lead pencil, and of even greater delicacy, is
silver-point drawing. A more ancient method, it consists in drawing
with a silver point on paper the surface of which has been treated
with a faint wash of Chinese white. Without this wash the point
will not make a mark.</p>
<p>For extreme delicacy and purity of line no medium can surpass
this method. And for the expression of a beautiful line, such as a
profile, nothing could be more suitable than a silver point. As a
training to the eye and hand also, it is of great value, as no
rubbing out of any sort is possible, and eye and hand must work
together with great exactness. The discipline of silver-point
drawing is to be recommended as a corrective to the picturesque
vagaries of charcoal work.</p>
<p>A gold point, giving a warmer line, can also be used in the same
way as a silver point, the paper first having been treated with
Chinese white.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Charcoal.</div>
<p>Two extreme points of view from which the rendering of form can
be approached have been explained, and it has been suggested that
students should study them both separately in the first instance,
as they each have different things to teach. Of the mediums that
are best suited to a drawing combining both points of view, the
first and most popular is charcoal.</p>
<p>Charcoal is made in many different degrees of hardness and
softness, the harder varieties being capable of quite a fine point.
A chisel-shaped point is the most convenient, as it does not wear
away so quickly. And if the broad side of the chisel point <a name=
'Page_276' id="Page_276"></a><span class='pagenum'>276</span>is
used when a dark mass is wanted, the edge can constantly be kept
sharp. With this edge a very fine line can be drawn.</p>
<p>Charcoal works with great freedom, and answers readily when
forceful expression is wanted. It is much more like painting than
any other form of drawing, a wide piece of charcoal making a wide
mark similar to a brush. The delicacy and lightness with which it
has to be handled is also much more like the handling of a brush
than any other point drawing. When rubbed with the finger, it sheds
a soft grey tone over the whole work. With a piece of bread pressed
by thumb and finger into a pellet, high lights can be taken out
with the precision of white chalk; or rubber can be used. Bread is,
perhaps, the best, as it does not smudge the charcoal but lifts it
readily off. When rubbed with the finger, the darks, of course, are
lightened in tone. It is therefore useful to draw in the general
proportions roughly and rub down in this way. You then have a
middle tone over the work, with the rough drawing showing through.
Now proceed carefully to draw your lights with bread or rubber, and
your shadows with charcoal, in much the same manner as you did in
the monochrome exercises already described.</p>
<p>All preliminary setting out of your work on canvas is usually
done with charcoal, which must of course be fixed with a spray
diffuser. For large work, such as a full-length portrait, sticks of
charcoal nearly an inch in diameter are made, and a long swinging
line can be done without their breaking.</p>
<p>For drawings that are intended as things of beauty in
themselves, and are not merely done as a preparatory study for a
painting, charcoal is per<a name='Page_277' id=
"Page_277"></a><span class='pagenum'>277</span>haps not so refined
a medium as a great many others. It is too much like painting to
have the particular beauties of a drawing, and too much like
drawing to have the qualities of a painting. However, some
beautiful things have been done with it.</p>
<p>It is useful in doing studies where much finish is desired, to
fix the work slightly when drawn in and carried some way on. You
can work over this again without continually rubbing out with your
hand what you have already drawn. If necessary you can rub out with
a hard piece of rubber any parts that have already been fixed, or
even scrape with a pen-knife. But this is not advisable for
anything but an academic study, or working drawings, as it spoils
the beauty and freshness of charcoal work. Studies done in this
medium can also be finished with Cont&eacute; chalk.</p>
<p>There is also an artificial charcoal put up in sticks, that is
very good for refined work. It has some advantages over natural
charcoal, in that there are no knots and it works much more evenly.
The best natural charcoal I have used is the French make known as
"Fusain Rouget." It is made in three degrees, No. 3 being the
softest, and, of course, the blackest. But some of the ordinary
Venetian and vine charcoals sold are good. But don't get the
cheaper varieties: a bad piece of charcoal is worse than
useless.</p>
<p>Charcoal is fixed by means of a solution of white shellac
dissolved in spirits of wine, blown on with a spray diffuser. This
is sold by the artists' colourmen, or can be easily made by the
student. It lightly deposits a thin film of shellac over the work,
acting as a varnish and preventing its rubbing off.</p>
<p><a name='Page_278' id="Page_278"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>278</span>Charcoal is not on the whole the medium an
artist with a pure love of form selects, but rather that of the
painter, who uses it when his brushes and paints are not handy.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Red Chalk (Sanguine).</div>
<p>A delightful medium that can be used for either pure line work
or a mixed method of drawing, is red chalk. This natural red earth
is one of the most ancient materials for drawing. It is a lovely
Venetian red in colour, and works well in the natural state, if you
get a good piece. It is sold by the ounce, and it is advisable to
try the pieces as they vary very much, some being hard and gritty
and some more soft and smooth. It is also made by Messrs.
Cont&eacute; of Paris in sticks artificially prepared. These work
well and are never gritty, but are not so hard as the natural
chalk, and consequently wear away quickly and do not make fine
lines as well.</p>
<p>Red chalk when rubbed with the finger or a rag spreads evenly on
paper, and produces a middle tone on which lights can be drawn with
rubber or bread. Sticks of hard, pointed rubber are everywhere
sold, which, cut in a chisel shape, work beautifully on red chalk
drawings. Bread is also excellent when a softer light is wanted.
You can continually correct and redraw in this medium by rubbing it
with the finger or a rag, thus destroying the lights and shadows to
a large extent, and enabling you to draw them again more carefully.
For this reason red chalk is greatly to be recommended for making
drawings for a picture where much fumbling may be necessary before
you find what you want. Unlike charcoal, it hardly needs fixing,
and much more intimate study of the forms can be got into it.</p>
<p><a name='Page_279' id="Page_279"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>279</span>Most of the drawings by the author reproduced
in this book are done in this medium. For drawings intended to have
a separate existence it is one of the prettiest mediums. In fact,
this is the danger to the student while studying: your drawing
looks so much at its best that you are apt to be satisfied too
soon. But for portrait drawings there is no medium to equal it.</p>
<p>Additional quality of dark is occasionally got by mixing a
little of this red chalk in a powdered state with water and a very
little gum-arabic. This can be applied with a sable brush as in
water-colour painting, and makes a rich velvety dark.</p>
<p>It is necessary to select your paper with some care. The
ordinary paper has too much size on it. This is picked up by the
chalk, and will prevent its marking. A paper with little size is
best, or old paper where the size has perished. I find an O.W.
paper, made for printing etchings, as good as any for ordinary
work. It is not perfect, but works very well. What one wants is the
smoothest paper without a faced and hot-pressed surface, and it is
difficult to find.</p>
<p>Occasionally black chalk is used with the red to add strength to
it. And some draughtsmen use it with the red in such a manner as to
produce almost a full colour effect.</p>
<p>Holbein, who used this medium largely, tinted the paper in most
of his portrait drawings, varying the tint very much, and sometimes
using zinc white as a wash, which enabled him to supplement his
work with a silver-point line here and there, and also got over any
difficulty the size in the paper might cause. His aim seems to have
been to select the few essential things <a name='Page_280' id=
"Page_280"></a><span class='pagenum'>280</span>in a head and draw
them with great finality and exactness. In many of the drawings the
earlier work has been done with red or black chalk and then rubbed
down and the drawing redone with either a brush and some of the
chalk rubbed up with water and gum or a silver-point line of great
purity, while in others he has tinted the paper with water-colour
and rubbed this away to the white paper where he wanted a light, or
Chinese white has been used for the same purpose.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Black Cont&eacute; and Carbon Pencil.</div>
<p>Black Cont&eacute; is a hard black chalk made in small sticks of
different degrees. It is also put up in cedar pencils. Rather more
gritty than red chalk or charcoal, it is a favourite medium with
some, and can be used with advantage to supplement charcoal when
more precision and definition are wanted. It has very much the same
quality of line and so does not show as a different medium. It can
be rubbed like charcoal and red chalk and will spread a tone over
the paper in very much the same way.</p>
<p>Carbon pencils are similar to Cont&eacute;, but smoother in
working and do not rub.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>White chalk.</div>
<p>White chalk is sometimes used on toned paper to draw the lights,
the paper serving as a half tone while the shadows and outlines are
drawn in black or red. In this kind of drawing the chalk should
never be allowed to come in contact with the black or red chalk of
the shadows, the half tone of the paper should always be between
them.</p>
<p>For rubbed work white pastel is better than the ordinary white
chalk sold for drawing, as it is not so hard. A drawing done in
this method with white pastel and red chalk is reproduced on
<a name='Page_281' id="Page_281"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>281</span>page 46 [Transcribers Note: <a href=
"#plate04">Plate IV</a>], and one with the hard white chalk, on
page 260 [Transcribers Note: <a href="#plate54">Plate LIV</a>].</p>
<p>This is the method commonly used for making studies of drapery,
the extreme rapidity with which the position of the lights and
shadows can be expressed being of great importance when so unstable
a subject as an arrangement of drapery is being drawn.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Lithography.</div>
<p>Lithography as a means of artistic reproduction has suffered
much in public esteem by being put to all manner of inartistic
trade uses. It is really one of the most wonderful means of
reproducing an artist's actual work, the result being, in most
cases, so identical with the original that, seen together, if the
original drawing has been done on paper, it is almost impossible to
distinguish any difference. And of course, as in etching, it is the
prints that are really the originals. The initial work is only done
as a means of producing these.</p>
<p>A drawing is made on a lithographic stone, that is, a piece of
limestone that has been prepared with an almost perfectly smooth
surface. The chalk used is a special kind of a greasy nature, and
is made in several degrees of hardness and softness. No rubbing out
is possible, but lines can be scratched out with a knife, or parts
made lighter by white lines being drawn by a knife over them. A
great range of freedom and variety is possible in these initial
drawings on stone. The chalk can be rubbed up with a little water,
like a cake of water-colour, and applied with a brush. And every
variety of tone can be made with the side of the chalk.</p>
<p>Some care should be taken not to let the warm finger touch the
stone, or it may make a greasy mark that will print.</p>
<p><a name='Page_282' id="Page_282"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>282</span>When this initial drawing is done to the
artist's satisfaction, the most usual method is to treat the stone
with a solution of gum-arabic and a little nitric acid. After this
is dry, the gum is washed off as far as may be with water; some of
the gum is left in the porous stone, but it is rejected where the
greasy lines and tones of the drawing come. Prints may now be
obtained by rolling up the stone with an inked roller. The ink is
composed of a varnish of boiled linseed oil and any of the
lithographic colours to be commercially obtained.</p>
<p>The ink does not take on the damp gummed stone, but only where
the lithographic chalk has made a greasy mark, so that a perfect
facsimile of the drawing on stone is obtained, when a sheet of
paper is placed on the stone and the whole put through the
press.</p>
<p>The medium deserves to be much more popular with draughtsmen
than it is, as no more perfect means of reproduction could be
devised.</p>
<p>The lithographic stone is rather a cumbersome thing to handle,
but the initial drawing can be done on paper and afterwards
transferred to the stone. In the case of line work the result is
practically identical, but where much tone and playing about with
the chalk is indulged in, the stone is much better. Lithographic
papers of different textures are made for this purpose, but almost
any paper will do, provided the drawing is done with the special
lithographic chalk.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Pen and Ink.</div>
<p>Pen and ink was a favourite means of making studies with many
old masters, notably Rembrandt. Often heightening the effect with a
wash, he conveyed marvellous suggestions with the simplest
scribbles. But it is a difficult medium for the young <a name='Page_283'
id="Page_283"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>283</span>student to hope to do much with in his studies,
although for training the eye and hand to quick definite statement
of impressions, there is much to be said for it. No hugging of half
tones is possible, things must be reduced to a statement of clear
darks&mdash;which would be a useful corrective to the tendency so
many students have of seeing chiefly the half tones in their
work.</p>

</div>
<p>The kind of pen used will depend on the kind of drawing you wish
to make. In steel pens there are innumerable varieties, from the
fine crow-quills to the thick "J" nibs. The natural crow-quill is a
much more sympathetic tool than a steel pen, although not quite so
certain in its line. But more play and variety is to be got out of
it, and when a free pen drawing is wanted it is preferable.</p>
<p>Reed pens are also made, and are useful when thick lines are
wanted. They sometimes have a steel spring underneath to hold the
ink somewhat in the same manner as some fountain pens.</p>
<p>There is even a glass pen, consisting of a sharp-pointed cone of
glass with grooves running down to the point. The ink is held in
these grooves, and runs down and is deposited freely as the pen is
used. A line of only one thickness can be drawn with it, but this
can be drawn in any direction, an advantage over most other
shapes.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Etching.</div>
<p>Etching is a process of reproduction that consists in drawing
with a steel point on a waxed plate of copper or zinc, and then
putting it in a bath of diluted nitric acid to bite in the lines.
The longer the plate remains in the bath the deeper and darker the
lines become, so that variety in thickness is got by stopping out
with a varnish the light lines when they are sufficiently <a name='Page_284'
id="Page_284"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>284</span>strong, and letting the darker ones have a
longer exposure to the acid.</p>
<p>Many wonderful and beautiful things have been done with this
simple means. The printing consists in inking the plate all over
and wiping off until only the lines retain any ink, when the plate
is put in a press and an impression taken. Or some slight amount of
ink may be left on the plate in certain places where a tint is
wanted, and a little may be smudged out of the lines themselves to
give them a softer quality. In fact there are no end of tricks a
clever etching printer will adopt to give quality to his print.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>Paper.</div>
<p>The varieties of paper on the market at the service of the
artist are innumerable, and nothing need be said here except that
the texture of your paper will have a considerable influence on
your drawing. But try every sort of paper so as to find what suits
the particular things you want to express. I make a point of buying
every new paper I see, and a new paper is often a stimulant to some
new quality in drawing. Avoid the wood-pulp papers, as they turn
dark after a time. Linen rag is the only safe substance for good
papers, and artists now have in the O.W. papers a large series that
they can rely on being made of linen only.</p>
<p>It is sometimes advisable, when you are not drawing a subject
that demands a clear hard line, but where more sympathetic
qualities are wanted, to have a wad of several sheets of paper
under the one you are working on, pinned on the drawing-board. This
gives you a more sympathetic surface to work upon and improves the
quality of your work. In redrawing a study with which you are not
quite satisfied, it is a good plan to use a thin paper, <a name=
'Page_285' id="Page_285"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>285</span>pinning it over the first study so that it can
be seen through. One can by this means start as it were from the
point where one left off. Good papers of this description are now
on the market. I fancy they are called "bank-note" papers.</p>

<h2>XXI<br />
CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Mechanical invention, mechanical knowledge, and even a
mechanical theory of the universe, have so influenced the average
modern mind, that it has been thought necessary in the foregoing
pages to speak out strongly against the idea of a mechanical
standard of accuracy in artistic drawing. If there were such a
standard, the photographic camera would serve our purpose well
enough. And, considering how largely this idea is held, one need
not be surprised that some painters use the camera; indeed, the
wonder is that they do not use it more, as it gives in some
perfection the mechanical accuracy which is all they seem to aim at
in their work. There may be times when the camera can be of use to
artists, but only to those who are thoroughly competent to do
without it&mdash;to those who can look, as it were, through the
photograph and draw from it with the same freedom and spontaneity
with which they would draw from nature, thus avoiding its dead
mechanical accuracy, which is a very difficult thing to do. But the
camera is a convenience to be avoided by the student.</p>
<p>Now, although it has been necessary to insist strongly on the
difference between phenomena mechanically recorded and the records
of a living individual consciousness, I should be very sorry if
<a name='Page_287' id="Page_287"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>287</span>anything said should lead students to assume
that a loose and careless manner of study was in any way advocated.
The training of his eye and hand to the most painstaking accuracy
of observation and record must be the student's aim for many years.
The variations on mechanical accuracy in the work of a fine
draughtsman need not be, and seldom are, conscious variations.
Mechanical accuracy is a much easier thing to accomplish than
accuracy to the subtle perceptions of the artist. And he who cannot
draw with great precision the ordinary cold aspect of things cannot
hope to catch the fleeting aspect of his finer vision.</p>
<p>Those artists who can only draw in some weird fashion remote
from nature may produce work of some interest; but they are too
much at the mercy of a natural trick of hand to hope to be more
than interesting curiosities in art.</p>
<p>The object of your training in drawing should be to develop to
the uttermost the observation of form and all that it signifies,
and your powers of accurately portraying this on paper.</p>
<p><b>Unflinching honesty</b> must be observed in all your studies.
It is only then that the "you" in you will eventually find
expression in your work. And it is this personal quality, this
recording of the impressions of life as felt by a conscious
individual that is the very essence of distinction in art.</p>
<p>The "seeking after originality" so much advocated would be
better put "seeking for sincerity." Seeking for originality usually
resolves itself into running after any peculiarity in manner that
the changing fashions of a restless age may throw up. One of the
most original men who ever lived did not trouble to invent the
plots of more than three <a name='Page_288' id=
"Page_288"></a><span class='pagenum'>288</span>or four of his
plays, but was content to take the hackneyed work of his time as
the vehicle through which to pour the rich treasures of his vision
of life. And wrote:</p>
<div class='blockquote'>
<p>"What custom wills in all things do you do it."</p>
</div>
<p>Individual style will come to you naturally as you become more
conscious of what it is you wish to express. There are two kinds of
insincerity in style, the employment of a ready-made conventional
manner that is not understood and that does not fit the matter; and
the running after and laboriously seeking an original manner when
no original matter exists. Good style depends on a clear idea of
what it is you wish to do; it is the shortest means to the end
aimed at, the most apt manner of conveying that personal
"something" that is in all good work. "The style is the man," as
Flaubert says. The splendour and value of your style will depend on
the splendour and value of the mental vision inspired in you, that
you seek to convey; on the quality of the man, in other words. And
this is not a matter where direct teaching can help you, but rests
between your own consciousness and those higher powers that move
it.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>
<p>If you add a line of 5 inches to one of 8 inches you produce one
13 inches long, and if you proceed by always adding the last two
you arrive at a series of lengths, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 inches,
&amp;c. Mr. William Schooling tells me that any two of these lines
adjoining one another are practically in the same proportion to
each other; that is to say, one 8 inches is 1.600 times the size of
one 5 inches, and the 13-inch line is 1.625 the size of the 8-inch,
and the 21-inch line being 1.615 times the 13-inch line, and so on.
With the mathematician's love of accuracy, Mr. Schooling has worked
out the exact proportion that should exist between a series of
quantities for them to be in the same proportion to their
neighbours, and in which any two added together would produce the
next. There is only one proportion that will do this, and although
very formidable, stated exactly, for practical purposes, it is that
between 5 and a fraction over 8. Stated accurately to eleven places
of decimals it is (1 + sqrt(5))/2 = 1.61803398875 (nearly).</p>
<p>We have evidently here a very unique proportion. Mr. Schooling
has called this the Phi proportion, and it will be convenient to
refer to it by this name.</p>

<a href="#plate37">Plate XXXVII</a>].&mdash;Height of horizon line
Phi proportion with top and bottom of picture. Height of shell on
which Venus stands Phi proportion with top and bottom of picture,
the smaller quantity being below this time. Laterally the extreme
edge of dark drapery held by figure on right that blows towards
Venus is Phi proportion with sides of picture.</p>
<p>"The Rape of Europa," by Paolo Veronese, page 168 [Transcribers
Note: <a href="#plate38">Plate XXXVIII</a>].&mdash;Top of head of
Europa exactly Phi proportion with top and bottom of picture.
Right-hand side of same head slightly to left of Phi proportion
with sides of picture (unless in the reproduction a part of the
picture on the left has been trimmed away, as is likely, in which
case it would be exactly Phi proportion).</p>
<p>I have taken the first seven pictures reproduced in this book
that were not selected with any idea of illustrating this point,
and I think you will admit that in each some very important
quantity has been placed in this proportion. One could go on
through all the illustrations were it not for the fear of becoming
wearisome; and also, one could go on through some of the minor
relationships, and point out how often this proportion turns up in
compositions. But enough has been said to show that the eye
evidently takes some especial pleasure in it, whatever may
eventually be found to be the physiological reason underlying
it.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
